Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, firmly declined to exercise constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199, holding that disputes between attached departments of the Federal Government must first resolve through the consultative mechanism prescribed under Rule 8(2) of the Rules of Business, 1973, ultimately falling within the domain of the Prime Minister.Notably, the LHC emphasised that the dispute between FBR (Revenue Division) and FIA (Interior Division) is a classic inter-divisional conflict, constitutionally required to be resolved through ministerial consultation and, if needed, submission to the Prime Minister or Cabinet. Judicial intervention, the Court warned, should not convert into the “Federation litigating against itself.”
The case stemmed from Enquiry No E-77/2024, in which FIA officials issued multiple notices under the FIA Act, CrPC and AMLA, demanding production of five years’ confidential income and sales tax refund records of LTO Lahore. Despite repeated objections by FBR citing section 216 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, the FIA went a step further and raided LTO Lahore on 23.07.2024, forcibly seizing records under a magistrate-issued search warrant.
While declining relief on procedural grounds, the LHJC made several critical observations that FIA Act does not enjoy overriding supremacy over fiscal statutes, unlike NAB laws.
Protection remains applicable unless offences under FIA’s own statutory mandate are clearly made out. Fishing expeditions into taxpayer data violate the legislative scheme of tax administration, it added.

According to the details issued by the FBR, Pakistan Customs has achieved a historic and industry-wide breakthrough by ensuring the application of official bank exchange rates for shipping charges, effectively ending the long-standing practice of arbitrary and excessive billing by international shipping lines.
The All Pakistan Shipping Association (APSA), through a formal communication has confirmed that all member shipping lines are now charging shipping fees strictly on the basis of exchange rates provided by their respective authorised commercial banks, in accordance with State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) regulations.
This decisive development follows sustained engagement by a high-level committee constituted by Pakistan Customs, which held extensive consultations with shipping agents, terminal operators, trade bodies, and international shipping lines. As a key milestone, Maersk — the largest shipping line operating in Pakistan and handling nearly 26 percent of the country’s total cargo — earlier began applying official bank exchange rates, setting a benchmark for the rest of the industry.
Written confirmations of compliance have been received from major international shipping lines and their local agents, including Hapag-Lloyd, Ocean Network Express (ONE), COSCO Shipping, CMA CGM, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), OOCL, and United Marine Agencies, among others, establishing full industry-wide adherence to SBP-compliant exchange rates.
For several years, traders and exporters had raised serious concerns regarding the arbitrary application of inflated dollar exchange rates by shipping lines, often far exceeding SBP-notified rates. This practice significantly increased the cost of doing business, adversely impacted export competitiveness, and created uncertainty in shipping charges.
The initiative is expected to substantially reduce cost pressures on traders and exporters, improve transparency and predictability in shipping charges, and restore confidence within the business community.
This achievement underscores FBR’s firm commitment to safeguarding legitimate trade, promoting ease of doing business, and supporting Pakistan’s export-led economic growth through effective regulatory oversight and stakeholder engagement.

The Committee further estimated that economy has posted a growth of 3.71 percent during first quarter (Q1) of fiscal year 2025-26.The Fund stated that global growth is projected to remain resilient at 3.3 percent in 2026 and at 3.2 percent in 2027: rates similar to the estimated 3.3 percent outturn in 2025. The forecast marks a small upward revision for 2026 and no change for 2027 compared with that in the October 2025 WEO. This steady performance on the surface results from the balancing of divergent forces. Headwinds from shifting trade policies are offset by tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), more so in North America and Asia than in other regions, as well as fiscal and monetary support, broadly accommodative financial conditions, and adaptability of the private sector.Global headline inflation is expected to decline from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2025 to 3.8 percent in 2026 and further to 3.4 percent in 2027. The inflation projections are also broadly unchanged from those in October and envisage inflation returning to target more gradually in the United States than in other large economies.Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. Re-evaluation of productivity growth expectations about AI could lead to a decline in investment and trigger an abrupt financial market correction, spreading from AI-linked companies to other segments and eroding household wealth. Trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity. Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices. Larger fiscal deficits and high public debt could put pressure on long-term interest rates and, in turn, on broader financial conditions. On the upside, activity could be further lifted by AI-related investment and eventually transform into sustainable growth if faster AI adoption translates into strong productivity gains and increased business dynamism. Activity could also be supported by a sustained easing in trade tensions. Policies to foster stability and sustainably lift medium-term growth prospects require a keen focus on restoring fiscal buffers, preserving price and financial stability, reducing uncertainty, and implementing structural reforms without further delay.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:56:32 GMT",,"IMF has cut its GDP projection for the current fiscal year to 3.2 percent.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403644,"DAVOS 26: Exports and productive use of debt key to economic growth, says Aurangzeb - Business Recorder","DAVOS: Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, has underscored the importance of fiscal discipline, productive use of debt and export-led growth as key pathways to unlocking new sources of economic growth, while speaking at a high-level panel discussion on “How Can We Unlock New Sources of Growth? – Weight of Global Debt” held on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Presenting an emerging markets perspective, Senator Aurangzeb emphasized that debt, in itself, is not inherently negative, provided it is deployed productively.
He noted that for countries like Pakistan, debt must be directed toward investments that generate exportable surplus rather than consumption, enabling sustainable repayment and long-term growth.

He highlighted that emerging economies do not have privilege of reserve currencies and therefore must ensure market efficiency, prudent borrowing and careful management of foreign exchange risks.
The minister stressed that unsustainable debt trajectories are fundamentally a consequence of weak fiscal discipline. He shared that Pakistan has made significant progress by reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from 75 percent to 70 percent, achieving a primary surplus and restoring fiscal balance through responsible economic management.
He added that inflation in Pakistan has declined sharply from a peak of 38 percent to single digits, while the policy rate has been reduced from over 22 percent to 10.5 percent, placing the country on the favourable side of the interest rate cycle.
Senator Aurangzeb highlighted ongoing debt management reforms, including liability management operations, debt buybacks and efforts to create value in domestic markets.
He also announced that Pakistan is set to enter the Chinese capital market with its inaugural Panda bond, structured as a green bond, reflecting the country’s commitment to sustainable and climate-resilient financing.
Addressing the issue of climate change, the Minister stated that for Pakistan and other vulnerable emerging economies, climate risks are real, recurring and economically disruptive.
He noted that building fiscal buffers has enabled Pakistan to respond to recent floods through domestic resources rather than international emergency appeals, underscoring the importance of fiscal resilience in the face of exogenous shocks.
He further highlighted the role of public-private partnerships and capital markets in financing adaptation and development projects, citing the successful closure of Pakistan’s largest-ever syndicated financing of approximately USD 3.6 billion for a major copper mining project.
The project, he noted, is expected to generate around USD 2.8 billion in exports annually from 2028, significantly strengthening Pakistan’s export base and supporting global energy transition needs.
Responding to a question from the audience on technology funding and the new economy, Senator Aurangzeb emphasized Pakistan’s strong potential in IT, freelancing and digital services, noting recent growth in IT exports and ongoing investments in skills development, blockchain and emerging technologies.
He reiterated that access to funding is not the core challenge; rather, capacity building, prioritization and effective execution are critical to translating opportunities into sustainable growth.
Concluding his remarks, the Minister stated that responsible fiscal management, strategic use of debt, investment in the new economy and climate resilience are central to Pakistan’s growth strategy, adding that “it is not about the availability of debt or funding, but how wisely and effectively it is steered to create long-term economic value.”
The panel discussion was hosted and moderated by Joumanna Bercetche, Anchor, Bloomberg News, and featured leading global financial and investment figures, including Anne Walsh, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Guggenheim Partners; Ronald P. O’Hanley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of State Street; and Jennifer Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of Franklin Templeton.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403328,Fitch Ratings affirms Pakistan’s long-term debt ratings at B- - Business Recorder,"Fitch Ratings affirmed Pakistan’s long-term debt ratings at B- and assigned a Recovery Rating of RR4 following the removal of the ratings from Under Criteria Observation (UCO), according to an official release on Wednesday.
The rating actions reflect the application of Fitch’s new Sovereign Rating Criteria, effective September 2025, and the inclusion of recovery assumptions into sovereign debt ratings for the first time.
Fitch’s credit rating scale for issuers and issues is expressed using the categories ‘AAA’ to ‘BBB’ (investment grade) and ‘BB’ to ‘D’ (speculative grade) with an additional +/- for AA through CCC levels indicating relative differences of probability of default or recovery for issues.
The terms “investment grade” and “speculative grade” are market conventions and do not imply any recommendation or endorsement of a specific security for investment purposes. Investment grade categories indicate relatively low to moderate credit risk, while ratings in the speculative categories signal either a higher level of credit risk or that a default has already occurred.

Key rating drivers
The senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Pakistan and The Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Company Limited are equalised with Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), reflecting “Fitch’s expectation of average recovery prospects in a default scenario, given Pakistan’s high levels of general government debt and interest payments as a percentage of revenue, and the absence of any other clearly identifiable criteria factors that would cause us to notch the debt ratings up or down from the IDR”.
On April 15, 2025,Fitch upgradedPakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR to B- with a stable outlook, from CCC+.
Pakistan has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for political stability and rights and for the rule of law, institutional and regulatory quality and control of corruption, as is the case for all sovereigns.
“These scores reflect the high weight that World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model. Pakistan has a WBGI ranking at the 22nd percentile,” Fitch said.
Rating sensitivities
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade include failure to keep government debt and debt-servicing metrics on a firm downward path, and renewed deterioration in external liquidity conditions, for example from delays in International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme reviews or insufficiently tight economic policy settings.
Meanwhile, factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade include significant declines in government debt and debt-servicing burdens, for example due to the implementation of fiscal consolidation plans in line with IMF programme commitments, leading to structural improvements in tax revenue generation.
Further significant easing of external financing risks, including evidence of greater ability to source external funding and a sustained recovery in foreign-currency reserves beyond Fitch’s forecasts could also lead to a positive rating action.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:58:31 GMT",,"Fitch Ratings affirmed Pakistan’s long-term debt ratings at B- and assigned a Recovery Rating of RR4 following the removal of the ratings from Under Criteria Observation (UCO) The rating actions reflect the application of Pakistan has a WBGI ranking at the 22nd percentile,’ Fitch said. “These scores reflect the high weight that World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model.",2.301156759262085

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403174,"EDITORIAL: Overspending, not taxes, is the problem - Business Recorder","EDITORIAL: For years, the accepted wisdom in Pakistan’s economic policymaking circles has treated the country’s fiscal distress as a problem that primarily begins and ends with low tax collection.
A fresh analysis cited by former caretaker commerce minister Gohar Ejaz, however, underscores a harder truth economists have long flagged: ballooning government expenditure has repeatedly outpaced revenue gains, reducing higher taxes into little more than a stopgap while debt continues to mount. Pakistan’s challenge, at its core, then is an expenditure crisis, one where runaway state spending, and not just taxpayer failure, is pushing public debt to unsustainable levels and exposing the limits of the government’s current economic playbook.
Recently-released data by the Economic Policy and Business Development think tank that Ejaz chairs decisively dismantles the notion that the country’s fiscal troubles stem from inadequate taxation. Between FY15 and FY25, tax revenue expanded by an extraordinary 302 percent, from Rs 2.91 trillion to Rs 11.7 trillion. This was an outcome driven by successive tax hikes, the withdrawal of exemptions and a regressive tax regime that repeatedly targets the same narrow, documented segments of the economy while leaving large swathes undertaxed. Yet even allowing for persistent under-taxation and the dominance of undocumented economic activity — problems that unquestionably require urgent correction — the public debt trajectory over the same decade makes it blatantly clear that our fiscal crisis has been fuelled far more by the scale and structure of government spending, with public debt rising by a staggering 365 percent from Rs 17.3 trillion to Rs 80.5 trillion, inflating debt servicing costs and decisively outpacing revenue growth.
READ MORE:Govt debt stocks slump Rs345bn in 5 months
These figures expose a disturbing distortion at the heart of Pakistan’s public finances that sees each extra rupee extracted in taxes matched by Rs 7.2 in new borrowing. In absolute terms, this amounts to tax receipts rising by Rs 8.79 trillion, while total debt soared by Rs 63.2 trillion. Furthermore, this imbalance has only hardened in recent times. Over the past three years, domestic debt servicing has emerged as the single largest source of expenditure growth, steadily squeezing development spending and choking off productive investment — precisely the kind of spending needed to arrest the debt spiral.
Debt accumulation, in itself, need not be destabilising if it is deployed strategically and is used to finance growth-enhancing infrastructure, build human capital, or expand the economy’s productive capacity in ways that generate future returns. In Pakistan, however, an increasing share of borrowing is being consumed simply to service past liabilities. And what little room remains is further devoured by other non-development expenditures: government departments routinely overshooting their budgets, an entrenched reluctance to rein in lavish state spending, a pensions bill that continues to expand, and a governance framework that structurally encourages higher spending: civil administration remains overstaffed and poorly streamlined, and ministries that should have been devolved to the provinces under the 18th Amendment continue to function at the federal level, entrenching inefficiency and inflating government spending. Austerity drives are announced with much fanfare, but rarely have they been matched by the political will required to cut wasteful spending or enforce meaningful fiscal discipline, ensuring that adjustment remains cosmetic while the underlying fiscal rot deepens.
The fact of the matter is that continued reliance on higher taxes, without reining in public spending will only further shrink the formal sector, weaken export competitiveness, and deter both domestic and foreign investment. The reality is clear: sustainable economic recovery depends on sharply reducing borrowing and dismantling the entrenched culture of profligacy within government. Breaking the seemingly endless cycle of borrowing, debt servicing and revenue shortfalls is essential to restore long-term fiscal stability, and the government must realise that meaningful austerity that enforces genuine spending discipline and reforms inefficiencies is the only viable path forward.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402603/editorial-export-emergency-awareness-is-first-step-towards-resolution,EDITORIAL: Export emergency: awareness is first step towards resolution - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal announced the imposition of an “Export Emergency” in the country entailing the creation of a special cell in the Prime Minister’s Office to address problems and constraints facing the business community on an urgent basis with the objective of increasing exports by 40 percent in four years and 200 percent by 2035.
His statement reflects an awareness of a decline in exports leading to a rise in the trade deficit during the first half of the current year against the same period the year before — negative USD 19,204 million as opposed to negative USD 14,271 million — which implies that the reliance on foreign borrowing, including rollovers from friendly countries, borrowing from bilaterals and multilaterals, to shore up foreign exchange reserves continues unabated.
Awareness of a problem is the first step towards its resolution and requires sector experts/stakeholders to delve into the causes of the problem and formulate a set of remedial measures designed to resolve it in the short, medium and ideally long term.
There is a plethora of empirical research gathering dust in government offices that highlights the reasons behind Pakistan’s cyclical economic volatility.
The October 2024 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report titled Request for an Extended Fund Arrangement reiterated the crux of the problem notably “economic volatility has only increased over time, with a tight correlation between Pakistan’s boom-bust economic outcomes and its macroeconomic policies.” The report, disturbingly, added that “compared to nine other regional peers, the country’s export growth since 2000 has been second to last, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.

The country’s trade restrictions (including exchange measures, tariff and non-tariff barriers, restrictions to payments, etc.) have placed it consistently at or around the 90th percentile of the highest Measurement of Aggregate Trade Restrictions index…. This high level of protection has not helped improve, and likely undermined, Pakistan’s competitiveness.” One can only hope that the export emergency cell would take cognizance of these observations and not repeat past mistakes which have been to extend monetary and fiscal subsidies to specific influential sectors with the objective of increasing exports, which would reactivate the boom-bust syndrome.
While setting up an export emergency cell in the PM Office indicates that that the government has elevated it at the highest executive level, thereby facilitating appropriate policy decisions promptly, there is a need to carefully review the pledges made by the economic team leaders to the Fund — pledges that if not met may not only lead to a cessation of the next tranche release but as has been evident since 2019 may lead to the three friendly countries refusing to roll over 12 billion dollars to another year.
The Fund’s advice is implicit in its observation: “with an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles, the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products. Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors.” In other words, structural reforms are required that do not consist of monetary or fiscal incentives or setting up special economic zones, that the government has pledged to phase out and not announce any new ones but to end all existing economic distortions.
If past precedence is anything to go by an ‘export emergency cell’ will undertake measures that would bring it in conflict with pledges made to the IMF. To increase our leverage with the Fund would require taking measures that would be supported by the Fund and include ending the energy cross-subsidy paid for by industry, reducing current expenditure to create fiscal space that would ease the vise-like application of the Federal Board of Revenue’s audit function being described as harassment by industry, end red tape implicit in any new venture and end the elite capture of both budgeted resources as well as outlay.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403554/dollar-edges-lower-as-greenland-concerns-ease,Dollar edges lower as Greenland concerns ease - Business Recorder,"NEW YORK: The US dollar was lower on Thursday as the “sell America” trade faded after President Donald Trump dropped tariff threats and ruled out seizing Greenland by force, and was little changed by US inflation data that was in line with market expectations.
New Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation data - the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge - were unveiled, showing that US consumer spending increased solidly in October and November, likely keeping the economy on track for a third straight quarter of strong growth.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 0.5 percent after rising by the same margin in October, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.5 percent in November.
The greenback recovered versus the euro on Wednesday on Trump’s remarks about Greenland, after losing a bit less than 1 percent between Monday and Tuesday. It was last down 0.35 percent to USD1.1726 per euro, following a 0.35 percent rebound in the prior session. The dollar weakened 0.52 percent to 0.7913 Swiss francs.
The Australian dollar rose to a 15-month high, buoyed by data showing an unexpected decline in the jobless rate. The yen remained under pressure after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi this week called a snap election and pledged measures to loosen fiscal policy.
Trump’s threat to levy tariffs on allied nations resisting his ambition to control Greenland had spooked markets, triggering a broad selloff of US assets. Still, some analysts said there was little evidence of a real move out of the US dollar.
“This whole argument about European investors selling US assets is very hard to sustain,” said Bob Savage, head market strategist at BNY.
“This isn’t a ‘sell America’ story, it’s a risk-management story,” he added. “We’re just seeing more hedging because volatility has risen after being at very low levels at the end of last year.”
Details of a framework for an agreement on Greenland were not yet known. However, “the most likely outcome is still that the next wave of excitement will pass us by after a brief period of volatility and that the market will refocus on central banks and interest rate differentials,” Savage said.
The Aussie was last up 0.83 percent to USD0.6818, touching its strongest level since October 2024, and headed for a fourth straight daily gain, outperforming even as risk assets came under pressure this week.
“The strength of both the Australian and the New Zealand dollar is the latest example that speculation about moves in short-term interest rates in relation to central bank policy remains alive and well,” said Jane Foley, senior forex strategist at Rabobank.
The Japanese currency weakened 0.07 percent at 158.415 per US dollar, near last week’s 18-month trough of 159.45.

Oil prices slide

NEW YORK: Oil prices slid about 2 percent on Thursday after US President Donald Trump softened threats against Greenland and Iran, and as investors assessed the supply-demand outlook.
Brent futures fell USD1.01, or 1.6percent, to USD64.23 a barrel at 11:26 a.m. EDT (1626 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 96 cents, or 1.6percent, to USD59.66 a barrel, headed for its lowest close since January 15.
Trump said he had secured total and permanent US access to Greenland in a deal with NATO, whose head said allies would have to step up their commitment to Arctic security to ward off threats from Russia and China.
Trump also backed off tariff threats and ruled out taking Greenland by force, moderating a stance that had caused a rupture in transatlantic ties. “There is a deflation of risk premium related to the Greenland debacle and Iran supply risk has also been reduced,” said Ole Hansen, chief commodity analyst at Saxo Bank.
Trump said he hoped there would be no further US military action in Iran, but added the US would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear programme.
Iran, operating under sanctions, is the third biggest crude producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) organization behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. With less tension around Greenland and Iran, oil prices should hold at around USD60 a barrel, said Tony Sycamore, an analyst with online broker IG.
Trump called for an end to the war in Ukraine, and reported “good” talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Davos. US and Ukrainian officials have spent weeks in shuttle diplomacy. Trump has pressured Kyiv to secure peace after nearly four years of war, despite few signs Moscow wants to stop fighting. A deal to bring peace to Ukraine and lift sanctions on Russia, the world’s third-biggest crude producer, could reduce oil prices by making more fuel available on global markets.
The French navy intercepted a Russian tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of being part of a shadow fleet that enables Russia to export oil despite sanctions.
Russian oil output fell 0.8percent to 10.28 million barrels per day (bpd) last year, around a tenth of global production, according to data published on Thursday.","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:48:08 GMT",,"The US dollar was lower on Thursday as the “sell America’ trade faded.
