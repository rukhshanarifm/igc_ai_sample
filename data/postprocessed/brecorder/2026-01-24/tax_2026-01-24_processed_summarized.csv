https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403007/the-investment-drain,The investment drain - Business Recorder,"Pakistan is the 5th most populous country having 64 percent of its population under the age of 30. It is often being pitched as a land of opportunities. However, despite an expanding market, a youthful workforce and strategic location, the country has not been able to attract enough investment, whether domestic and foreign.
A lot of literature has highlighted various economic issues as the main culprits like interest rate, exchange rate, inflation, low economic growth, etc. but, there are some other issues, which are affecting investment adversely in the country. When other countries are moving upward, Pakistan’s investment is sliding downward.
Back in 1975, the investment to GDP ratio of Pakistan was approximately 17 percent. After 50 years, it has decreased to 13.1 percent, which is a serious concern and needs proper pondering of policy makers.
Beside weak domestic investment, the country’s performance of attracting FDI is also lackluster. Back in 1990s, Pakistan used to attract more FDIs than India, but the equation has flipped completely. For example, in 1992, Pakistan attracted USD 336.5 million in FDI, while India attracted only USD 276.5 million. Now the trajectory has completely changed; in 2024, Pakistan only managed USD 2.7 billion, while India attracted USD 27.1 billion, which is almost 13 times higher.
In 2022, India attracted USD 50 billion FDI, while Pakistan has just USD 1.46 billion. Why has this huge divergence occurred? Various initiatives were taken like the Board of Investment, One Window Operation, and most recently the establishment of SIFC, but to no avail. Simply, policies are not feasible to attract the investors.
For instance, take the corporate tax rate, which is extremely high and can reach 65 percent. An investor wants profit, not punishment for investing. The standard corporate base rate is 29 percent and reaches up to 44 percent for some sectors. Then there are 10 percent super tax, 2 percent worker welfare fund, and 5 percent worker participation fund, summing up to 50 percent.
Also add 15 percent income tax of the dividends; the tax rate reaches 65 percent. Why on the earth will someone invest with such a higher tax rate? Why an investor will not invest in Dubai where the corporate tax rate is only 9 percent when income is above a threshold otherwise 0 percent tax? However, this seems a small problem as compared to the other issues, which are discouraging investors.
The security situation is one of them. It has not improved for decades. The country ranked second on the Global Terrorism Index and the attacks are not receding. How is one supposed to invest in such situation? Even domestic investors have shifted their capital to safe havens.
Similarly, the law and order situation in the country is also forcing investors to move to safer avenues.
Political instability is another major hurdle. Political parties are after one another driven by vendetta and not by national interest. There is no long-term political vision for the betterment of the country.
Citizens witness strikes, lockdowns and closure of main roads for weeks, affecting businesses adversely. In developed democracies, there are consistencies of policy regardless whichever party is in the government. Regrettably, the case is different in Pakistan.
Likewise, regulatory burdens and red tape are another nightmare. Instead of facilitation, regulations are often used as a tool of control. Compliance is very time consuming. If someone wants to install an electricity or gas connection, he has to wait for months. If one wants faster service, then one has to grease the palm of the authorities.
Similarly, opening a bank account is a herculean task, providing endless documents like utility bills, proof of income and so on. Company registration takes even more long and hectic documentation. Why would someone put his hard earned money in a process full of hurdles? On top of that, repatriating money or profit is also a struggle.
The weak judicial system is often ignored while discussing the investment issue. A strong judicial system provides confidence to investors that his interest cannot be harmed by anyone. Pakistan judicial system is ranked 129 out of 142 on the World Justice Project. There is no quick mechanism for dispute resolution.
The courts are overburdened and inefficient having more than 2.3 million backlog of cases. A commercial dispute takes years and sometime even decades. If someone wants to trouble you, he will just file a fabricated case and it will take years to prove that there is nothing substantial behind it.
For many domestic investors, the fear of political victimization combined with the lack of judicial protection discourages them to invest.
Then there are issues of infrastructure and policy inconsistency. Investors face electricity and power outages along with very high cost. To cope, many businesses have installed solar for power generation and every year there is a debate to tax their own generation.
The lack of policy inconsistency makes the situation further exacerbated. Many investors fear that today’s rules will not survive the next budget. In such unpredictability, no one is ready to invest in the country.
To cut the long story short, if Pakistan wants high investment, it has to make some amends. Otherwise, increasing investment will be a far cry in the wilderness.
Pakistan must address its governance problem, improve its law and order situation, strengthen its judicial system, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, improve policy consistency and cool down the political temperature. Then it will boost the morale of investors to invest in the country. Instead of higher taxes, the country needs to incentivize investors so that productivity can rise. Without transparent tax system, regulatory regime, protection of rights, contract enforcement, sustainable macro policy and reliable infrastructure, Pakistan will be bypassed by the serious investors.
The country cannot afford the outflow of investors like the recent exit of Procter & Gamble (P&G), Shell, Telenor, Pfizer, Bayer, Total Energies, Uber, Careem, and Microsoft.

Addressing an event at the Pakistan Pavilion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s 56th annual meeting in Davos, the prime minister said key macroeconomic indicators were showing a clear positive trend, reflecting disciplined economic management.
“Our inflation has come down sharply from 30 percent to 5.5 percent, while the policy rate has been reduced from 22.5 percent to 10.5 percent,” he said, calling the progress a result of difficult but necessary reforms.

Shehbaz said Pakistan had achieved macroeconomic stability and was now focused on sustainable growth driven by exports. He noted that IT exports had shown encouraging momentum and currently stood at around $3 billion annually through offshore channels.
While acknowledging challenges in the export sector, the prime minister said the direction was clear.
“Pakistan has to pursue export-led growth,” he said, highlighting reforms in revenue collection as a central pillar of the government’s strategy.
He said the tax system was being fully digitised, leading to an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio to 10.5 percent from 9 percent a few years ago, terming it a significant milestone.

Highlighting sectoral opportunities, Shehbaz said agricultural exports had performed well over the past year, while Pakistan was entering the mining and minerals sector. He said agreements had been signed with American and Chinese companies to explore untapped resources in Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
The prime minister said Pakistan was also moving rapidly in emerging fields such as information technology, artificial intelligence and crypto, describing the country’s large youth population as both a challenge and a major opportunity.
He said federal and provincial governments were jointly implementing programmes to equip young people with vocational and technical skills, citing the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), whose initiatives undergo third-party audits and international certification to help youth secure employment abroad.
On foreign relations, Shehbaz said Pakistan enjoyed strong economic ties with China and was expanding cooperation with the United States in areas including mining, minerals, counterterrorism and technology.
He also highlighted the government’s push for transparent privatisation, including Pakistan International Airlines, and said further privatisation and outsourcing were planned in airports, power distribution companies and transmission infrastructure.
Referring to the IMF programme, the prime minister said Pakistan had implemented strict conditions “in letter and spirit,” adding that the Fund was now citing Pakistan as a success story among developing countries.
On structural reforms, he said the government had taken politically difficult decisions to shut down loss-making state entities, including Utility Stores Corporation, PASSCO and the Pakistan Public Works Department, resulting in savings of billions of rupees despite resistance from vested interests.
“We are at a point where Pakistan is about to take off,” Shehbaz said, stressing that unity, transparency and sustained reforms were essential to achieving long-term economic growth and prosperity.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:30:39 GMT",,tax to GDP ratio Pakistan,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif says Pakistan is now firmly positioned for export-led growth.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403067/imf-lowers-pakistans-growth-outlook,IMF lowers Pakistan’s growth outlook - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered Pakistan’s economic growth outlook, cutting its GDP projection for the current fiscal year to 3.2 percent, down from 3.6 percent estimated in its October 2025 World Economic Outlook.
The Fund in its latest report “World Economic Outlook 2026 update, global economy: steady amid divergent forces”, estimated Pakistan’ GDP growth at three percent in 2025, which is projected to grow to 3.2 percent in the outgoing fiscal year 2026 and 4.1 percent in 2027.
World Bank has projected Pakistan GDP growth to remain at three percent in fiscal year 2025–26 before rising to 3.4 percent in fiscal year 2026–27.
READ MORE:IMF sees 6.5% GDP upside if Pakistan fixes corruption, governance
The National Accounts Committee (NAC) has approved the updated growth of GDP during fiscal year 2024-25 at 3.09 percent. The Committee further estimated that economy has posted a growth of 3.71 percent during first quarter (Q1) of fiscal year 2025-26.
The Fund stated that global growth is projected to remain resilient at 3.3 percent in 2026 and at 3.2 percent in 2027: rates similar to the estimated 3.3 percent outturn in 2025.
The forecast marks a small upward revision for 2026 and no change for 2027 compared with that in the October 2025 WEO. This steady performance on the surface results from the balancing of divergent forces. Headwinds from shifting trade policies are offset by tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), more so in North America and Asia than in other regions, as well as fiscal and monetary support, broadly accommodative financial conditions, and adaptability of the private sector.
Global headline inflation is expected to decline from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2025 to 3.8 percent in 2026 and further to 3.4 percent in 2027.
The inflation projections are also broadly unchanged from those in October and envisage inflation returning to target more gradually in the United States than in other large economies.
Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. Re-evaluation of productivity growth expectations about AI could lead to a decline in investment and trigger an abrupt financial market correction, spreading from AI-linked companies to other segments and eroding household wealth.
Trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity. Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices.
Larger fiscal deficits and high public debt could put pressure on long-term interest rates and, in turn, on broader financial conditions.
On the upside, activity could be further lifted by AI-related investment and eventually transform into sustainable growth if faster AI adoption translates into strong productivity gains and increased business dynamism. Activity could also be supported by a sustained easing in trade tensions.
Policies to foster stability and sustainably lift medium-term growth prospects require a keen focus on restoring fiscal buffers, preserving price and financial stability, reducing uncertainty, and implementing structural reforms without further delay.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403644/unlocking-new-sources-of-economic-growth-aurangzeb-spells-out-key-pathways,Unlocking new sources of economic growth: Aurangzeb spells out key pathways - Business Recorder,"DAVOS: Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, has underscored the importance of fiscal discipline, productive use of debt and export-led growth as key pathways to unlocking new sources of economic growth, while speaking at a high-level panel discussion on “How Can We Unlock New Sources of Growth? – Weight of Global Debt” held on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Presenting an emerging markets perspective, Senator Aurangzeb emphasized that debt, in itself, is not inherently negative, provided it is deployed productively.
He noted that for countries like Pakistan, debt must be directed toward investments that generate exportable surplus rather than consumption, enabling sustainable repayment and long-term growth.

He highlighted that emerging economies do not have privilege of reserve currencies and therefore must ensure market efficiency, prudent borrowing and careful management of foreign exchange risks.
The minister stressed that unsustainable debt trajectories are fundamentally a consequence of weak fiscal discipline. He shared that Pakistan has made significant progress by reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from 75 percent to 70 percent, achieving a primary surplus and restoring fiscal balance through responsible economic management.
He added that inflation in Pakistan has declined sharply from a peak of 38 percent to single digits, while the policy rate has been reduced from over 22 percent to 10.5 percent, placing the country on the favourable side of the interest rate cycle.
Senator Aurangzeb highlighted ongoing debt management reforms, including liability management operations, debt buybacks and efforts to create value in domestic markets.
He also announced that Pakistan is set to enter the Chinese capital market with its inaugural Panda bond, structured as a green bond, reflecting the country’s commitment to sustainable and climate-resilient financing.
Addressing the issue of climate change, the Minister stated that for Pakistan and other vulnerable emerging economies, climate risks are real, recurring and economically disruptive.
He noted that building fiscal buffers has enabled Pakistan to respond to recent floods through domestic resources rather than international emergency appeals, underscoring the importance of fiscal resilience in the face of exogenous shocks.
He further highlighted the role of public-private partnerships and capital markets in financing adaptation and development projects, citing the successful closure of Pakistan’s largest-ever syndicated financing of approximately USD 3.6 billion for a major copper mining project.
The project, he noted, is expected to generate around USD 2.8 billion in exports annually from 2028, significantly strengthening Pakistan’s export base and supporting global energy transition needs.
Responding to a question from the audience on technology funding and the new economy, Senator Aurangzeb emphasized Pakistan’s strong potential in IT, freelancing and digital services, noting recent growth in IT exports and ongoing investments in skills development, blockchain and emerging technologies.
He reiterated that access to funding is not the core challenge; rather, capacity building, prioritization and effective execution are critical to translating opportunities into sustainable growth.
Concluding his remarks, the Minister stated that responsible fiscal management, strategic use of debt, investment in the new economy and climate resilience are central to Pakistan’s growth strategy, adding that “it is not about the availability of debt or funding, but how wisely and effectively it is steered to create long-term economic value.”

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403764/matters-related-to-ito-section-4-c-federation-fbr-have-filed-several-icas-before-ihc-fcc-told,"Matters related to ITO Section 4-C: Federation, FBR have filed several ICAs before IHC, FCC told - Business Recorder","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) was told on Friday that the federation and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), aggrieved by a series of judgments passed by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) concerning matters related to Section 4-C of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, had filed several intra-court appeals before the IHC.
A three-judge bench of the FCC, headed by Chief Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan heard the FBR appeals against the judgments of Sindh, Lahore and Islamabad high courts regarding levy of Super Tax under Section 4C, inserted in the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001 through Finance Act 2022.
Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, representing the Secretary Revenue Division, informed the bench that the preliminary objections raised by the taxpayer-respondents regarding the alleged non-maintainability of the petitions were wholly misconceived, legally untenable, and contrary to the constitutional and statutory framework.
READ MORE:FCC urged to rule: Charge applicable to each ‘block’ must be governed by law in force on last day
He said these appeals were subsequently transferred, under Article 186A of the Constitution to the constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and are presently pending before the FCC for final adjudication due to 27th Constitutional Amendment.
During the proceedings, Khokhar, providing further clarification on the constitutional framework, emphasised that Article 99 of the Constitution explicitly governs the conduct of executive business within the federation.
He pointed out that the article mandates that such business must be transacted in strict adherence to the Rules of Business, 1973, underscoring the importance of procedural compliance in the functioning of the executive branch.
The counsel for Secretary Revenue Division argued that under Rule 14A read with Entry 35 of Schedule II of the Rules of Business, 1973, the Revenue Division and FBR are exclusively entrusted with matters pertaining to taxation, fiscal policy, administration of tax laws, and the protection of federal revenue.
Consequently, the institution, prosecution, and defence of revenue litigation fall squarely within the constitutional domain of the Revenue Division and constitute acts of the federation carried out through a constitutionally designated Division.
He further said that in light of the amendments made to the Rules of Business, 1973, consultation with the Ministry of Law and Justice or the Office of the Attorney General is no longer mandatory for the institution or defence of revenue matters.
He further clarified that the subject of revenue litigation is explicitly excluded from Entry 21 of Schedule II of the Rules of Business. This exclusion, he argued, grants the Revenue Division and the FBR full autonomy in handling fiscal and taxation matters. As such, the FBR is not required to seek prior approval or consultation for such litigation, thereby affirming its independent authority in these matters.
He emphasized that once a subject is allocated to a Division under the Allocation of Business, Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules of Business, 1973, fully empower that Division to take all necessary executive actions to give effect to the law governing that subject, including the initiation, prosecution, and defence of legal proceedings. Any insistence on mandatory consultation, he argued, would defeat the very object of the amendments and undermine the efficiency of fiscal governance.
Khokhar further submitted that the FBR, being an attached department of the Revenue Division as per schedule 3 of the Rules of Business, 1973, derives its authority from both the constitutional framework and statutory enactments, including the Federal Board of Revenue Act, 2007, therefore all acts performed by the FBR and its officers in revenue litigation, constitute acts of the federation itself and enjoy a strong presumption of legality.
He maintained that the superior courts have consistently held that where executive authority flows directly from the Constitution and the Rules of Business, objections based on an alleged lack of authorization are devoid of merit unless a clear statutory prohibition is demonstrated.
He stressed that fiscal governance and the protection of public revenue cannot be frustrated by hyper-technical objections, particularly when statutory remedies are pursued in good faith within the constitutional framework.
Khokhar will make his further submissions on Monday.
Earlier, Asma Hamid argued that the taxpayers in their respective high courts have made the relevant Inland Revenue Commissioners party, but when they filed petitions before the IHC, then they also cited federation as respondent.
Justice Amin remarked that the taxpayer lawyers’ main objection is that the federation only can file appeals when the federal legislation is set aside by the High Courts, and not in case of issuance of notices.
Asma responded that all the high courts upheld the vires of Sections 4B and 4C, adding that the Supreme Court bench in its March 2023 leave grant order directed the taxpayers to pay 50 percent amount regarding the Super Tax.
Asma, continuing her arguments, noted that no taxpayer had raised any challenge against the Sindh High Court’s ruling, which had declared Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance intra vires and applicable from 2022. She concluded by stating that she would present her final submissions on Monday.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402780,‘Shadow economy’ primary hurdle for economic recovery - Business Recorder,"LAHORE: Pakistan can still achieve its ambitious tax collection targets if the government takes decisive action against illicit trade. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faced a significant shortfall of Rs545 billion against its original target during the first half of the current fiscal year. This gap reflects massive revenue leakage in the economy, sources said.
According to a study by Ipsos on tax evasion in five sectors, over Rs1 trillion is lost annually to tax evasion and smuggling across key sectors. A strategic focus on enforcement and documentation could provide the fiscal space needed to stabilize the economy without further burdening compliant taxpayers or the formal business community.
The “shadow economy” has become the primary hurdle for economic recovery. The real estate sector alone accounts for approximately Rs500 billion in annual tax losses, while illicit tobacco trade—comprising smuggled and non-tax-paid cigarettes costs the national exchequer another Rs310 billion. Other major industries, including tyres, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, and tea, collectively account for over Rs200 billion in additional evasion, the sources said.
Macroeconomic analyst Osama Siddiqui said because these sectors operate largely outside the documented net, fiscal pressure is unfairly shifted onto a small pool of compliant taxpayers. This creates a vicious cycle where high taxes further incentivize evasion and hinder commercial growth.
READ MORE:FBR’s ‘revolution’: future of Pakistan’s economic sovereignty
Siddiqui said that the solution lies in targeted enforcement rather than higher tax rates. “To meet these tax targets, the government must plug loopholes that lead to tax leakages and intensify targeted enforcement efforts,” he said, adding: “The state should focus on bringing the undocumented sector into the tax net and eliminating smuggling rather than solely relying on existing resources. The ineffective implementation of Track & Trace systems across various industries highlights a lack of government resolve in curbing illicit trade.”
He urged that the path to fiscal sustainability depends on shifting strategy from taxing the “already taxed” to capturing the “untaxed”. Strengthening regulatory enforcement and eliminating illicit trade networks are essential steps to ensure tax targets are met through growth and equity rather than emergency measures, he said.

A three-judge bench of the FCC, headed by Chief Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, on Monday heard appeals filed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) against judgments of the Sindh, Lahore, and Islamabad High Courts concerning the levy of Super Tax under Section 4C, inserted into the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001 through the Finance Act, 2021.
Advocate Adnan Haider, representing Trans World Associates, submitted that the split of the charge is not only necessary but also more equitable, as tax rates almost invariably change on the first day of the second block with the announcement of a new budget.

He argued that this approach would place special tax year holders on par with normal tax year holders, as both would know in advance which tax rates apply to their earnings, and their tax liability would crystallize on the last day of the relevant block.
Haider contended that under Section 74(1) of the ITO, a tax year comprises 12 months, while Section 74(2) provides that a special tax year may differ from a normal tax year (which corresponds to a financial year) and is denoted by the normal tax year in which its last day falls. He explained that his client follows the calendar year (January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021), which is denoted as Tax Year 2022.
He emphasized that, in the present matter, three six-month blocks are relevant for a Special Tax Year: the first block (January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021), which falls in Financial Year 2021 and is not subject to Section 4C of the ITO, 2001; the second block (July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021), which falls in Financial Year 2022 and to which Section 4C was retrospectively applied; and the third block (January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022), which also falls in Financial Year 2022 and is similarly subject to retrospective application of Section 4C.
Haider submitted that FBR’s counsel, Asma Hamid, relied on Lotte Akhtar (2011 PTD 2229) to argue that the levy imposed during the third block is chargeable even for the period falling within the first block in the case of a special tax year holder, despite the taxpayer’s accounts having closed at the end of the second block.
He contended that this interpretation would unlawfully expand a special tax year from 12 months to 18 months. Such an interpretation, he argued, would seriously prejudice special tax year holders and effectively convert Section 74(2) of the ITO, 2001 from a machinery provision into a charging provision, which it is not.
The taxpayer’s counsel further argued that the conflicting interpretations adopted by the High Courts not only make an 18-month period (three six-month blocks) relevant for special tax year holders but also cause prejudice.
He explained that when a charge is imposed in the third block, tax is extracted from special tax year holders even for the first block; however, when a benefit is granted in the third block, it is denied to special tax year holders on the ground that their accounting year had already ended with the close of the second block.
Haider stated that his client had already paid super tax for the first two blocks of its Special Tax Year 2022.
He added that after the Islamabad High Court read down Section 4C of the ITO in Fauji Fertilizer, the petitioner approached the IHC seeking a refund. However, the High Court declined to order a refund and directed the taxpayer to avail departmental remedies.
He maintained that the petitioner was forced to bear the burden of super tax for the first block, which falls in Financial Year 2021, when Section 4C of the ITO, 2001 was not in force. In contrast, taxpayers following a normal tax year were not subjected to super tax for that period—and rightly so.
Farogh Naseem and Adnan Haider have concluded their arguments. From today (Tuesday), Ahmed Jamal Sukhera is scheduled to present his arguments.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402846/editorial-pakistans-tax-system-and-the-states-behaviour,EDITORIAL: Pakistan’s tax system and the state’s behaviour - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: Pakistan’s tax system is once again being presented as standing at the threshold of reform. The Tax Policy Office’s invitation to the business community to submit proposals for Budget 2026–27 is framed as a turning point: a move away from short-term revenue pressures, toward consistency, economic value, and structured stakeholder engagement.
The institutional signal is deliberate. Tax policy formulation has been formally separated from tax administration, relocated from the Federal Board of Revenue to the Ministry of Finance. In theory, this distinction matters.
What undermines the claim is not scepticism about reform, but the state’s own behaviour.
At the same time that consultation is being emphasised, the government remains locked in a dispute with petroleum exploration and production companies over the application of Super Tax in excess of the fiscal caps embedded in petroleum concession agreements. These agreements are not discretionary incentives. They are statutory contracts, backed by law, designed to provide fiscal stability in a sector characterised by high risk, long gestation, and capital intensity.
The Islamabad High Court has already ruled that Super Tax cannot be applied beyond the thresholds stipulated in those agreements. Yet the matter remains unresolved, and the possibility of international arbitration has been openly raised.
This juxtaposition exposes a deeper contradiction in Pakistan’s fiscal governance. A tax system cannot credibly claim to be predictable, value-based, and consultative while simultaneously contesting the enforceability of its own legally binding commitments.
Policy consistency is not a matter of intent. It is revealed through adherence to rules when they become inconvenient.
The Super Tax episode is not an isolated dispute. It reflects a recurring instinct within the fiscal system: the treatment of taxation as a revenue extraction tool rather than as economic architecture. Periods of stress are routinely framed as exceptional moments that justify departures from established commitments. Temporary levies become semi-permanent. Emergency logic becomes normalised. Legal certainty becomes conditional.
This instinct sits uneasily with the language now being used by the Tax Policy Office. Claims that taxation will be guided by economic value rather than short-term exigency are difficult to reconcile with a willingness to override contractually agreed tax caps in pursuit of incremental revenue.
Arbitration risk, reputational damage, and higher future financing costs are treated as abstract concerns, rather than as real economic costs with long-term consequences.
The implications extend beyond the oil and gas sector. If fiscal terms explicitly protected by statute can be reopened retroactively, the signal to investors across sectors is unambiguous. Today’s framework offers no assurance against tomorrow’s revision.
Consultation may occur, but durability is not guaranteed. In such an environment, engagement becomes transactional rather than constructive, and proposals are shaped as defensive lobbying exercises rather than contributions to systemic reform.
The invocation of national priorities only sharpens the tension. Export competitiveness, industrial expansion, digital transformation, and energy security all depend on long-horizon investment and contractual confidence. These objectives cannot be advanced through a tax regime that relies on layered withholding, ad hoc surcharges, and retrospective reinterpretation of agreed terms. Growth does not emerge from consultation alone. It follows from credibility.
The institutional separation of tax policy from tax administration was long overdue.
In mature systems, it allows policy to be designed with economic coherence rather than enforcement convenience. But separation, by itself, does not guarantee reform. Its value depends on whether the new policy centre can impose discipline on the state’s own impulses, resist short-term revenue pressures, and internalise the full economic cost of policy instability.
That test is already in progress. The Super Tax dispute presents a clear, observable case where legal clarity, economic logic, and long-term interest align. How the government resolves it, will matter far more than how many proposals are submitted in response to a consultation notice.
Pakistan’s tax problem is not a shortage of ideas. It is a shortage of commitment to rules. Until policy credibility is restored through consistent behaviour, consultation will remain an exercise in reassurance rather than reform. The distinction is not procedural. It is foundational.

Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani tabled the bill for passage. The House passed the bill by majority vote.
Under the amended law, the appointment process for the chairperson of the ADR Committee has been revised to promote impartiality and transparency.
During deliberations on the Bill in the House, the Minister said that the legislation aims to address gaps in the existing framework, particularly concerning the appointment of the ADR Committee Chairperson.

He explained that the measure is intended to safeguard impartiality, improve operational efficiency, and ease the burden on the courts, thereby strengthening ADR as a credible, accessible, and cost-effective option for taxpayers.
He said, “under the new law, both taxpayers and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will propose three names each for the chairmanship. If consensus fails, one nominee from each side will be forwarded to the Law Minister for final decision.
The Chairperson must be a retired judge of the High Court, Federal Constitutional Court, or Supreme Court with relevant tax or commercial experience.”
The Minister said that previously the FBR held exclusive authority to appoint the chairman, raising concerns about impartiality. The revised process, he said, strengthens taxpayer protections, enhances the ADR framework, and ensures fair dispute resolution.
According to clause (3) of the bill, “the Chairman of the Board, after examination of the application of an aggrieved person, appoint a committee, within fifteen days of receipt of such application by the Board, comprising, —
(a) a retired judge of a High Court, the Federal Constitutional Court or the Supreme Court having adequate experience in dealing with tax or commercial matters, who shall also be the Chairperson of the Committee, to be nominated by the Chairman of the Board from a panel of three names proposed by the nominee of the taxpayer under clause (c) of this sub-section.In case the Chairman disagrees with the names proposed by the persons nominated by the taxpayer in terms of clause (c), the Chairman of the Board shall require the nominees appointed under clause (b) and (c) to propose one name each of a retired judge of a High Court, the Federal Constitutional Court or the Supreme Court having adequate experience in dealing with tax or commercial matters, whereupon the Chairman shall forward such names to the Federal Minister for Law and Justice for nomination of one of such persons as Chairperson of the Committee; (b) an officer of the Inland Revenue not below BS-21, other than the Chief Commissioner Inland Revenue having jurisdiction over the case; and (c) a person to be nominated by the taxpayer from amongst — (i) accountants within the meaning of the Chartered Accountants Ordinance, 1961 or(ii) cost and management accountants within the meaning of the Cost and Management Accountants Act, 1966; or (iii)advocates having a minimum of fifteen years’ experience in the field of taxation or commercial matters; or (iv)officers of the Inland Revenue who retired in BS-21 or above; or (v)businessmen from a list notified by the Board as recommended by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry: Provided that the taxpayer shall not nominate a chartered accountant or an advocate if the said chartered accountant or the advocate is or has been an auditor or an authorized representative of the taxpayer.”
According to the objects and reasons of the bill, “the bill aims to ensure impartiality and enhance efficiency in the ADR process, besides reducing litigation burden on courts. More aptly, the purpose of the bill is to make ADR a viable option for cost-effective resolution of tax disputes.”

The FTO categorically observed that there is absolutely no room for any department to undermine, bypass, or dilute the authority of the Supreme Court for any reason whatsoever.
The department is constitutionally and legally bound to respect, implement, and follow the judgments of the Supreme Court, and any attempt to circumvent or disregard such judgments is a direct violation of the rule of law and amounts to defiance of binding judicial orders.
The FTO held that failure to give appeal effect within the stipulated timeframe reflects delay, neglect, inefficiency, discrimination, and arbitrary exercise of authority, all of which squarely fall within the definition of maladministration under the law.
The FTO expressed deep frustration over the department’s persistent reluctance to give appeal effect to finalised appellate orders, despite clear judicial observations and settled legal positions. It was noted that once issues have been conclusively settled at the highest judicial forum, there remains no justification whatsoever for filing references on identical issues.
Such conduct serves no lawful purpose and is merely a tactic to delay the issuance of legitimate refunds.
Under the applicable law, the department was obligated to give appeal effect within two months of receipt of the appellate order.
However, the FTO found that despite the lapse of nearly ten months, the department has failed to comply with this mandatory legal requirement.
This landmark order by FTO Hijazi is being widely viewed as a strong reminder to tax authorities that administrative high-handedness cannot override constitutional mandates, and that respect for judicial supremacy is not optional but obligatory in a democratic system governed by the rule of law.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403743/cm-maryams-punjab-model-e-governance-and-a-corruption-free-system,CM Maryam’s Punjab Model: E-governance and a corruption-free system - Business Recorder,"As the Punjab Government completes two years in office this February, the moment invites a measured assessment of governance under the Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif—one grounded not in slogans but in outcomes.
In a province as large and administratively complex as Punjab, the credibility of any government rests on its ability to translate intent into delivery.
Public welfare, transparent development, and institutional efficiency remain the true benchmarks of leadership, and it is against these standards that the Punjab government’s record is increasingly being judged.
Over the past two years, the Punjab Government has pursued a governance model that places technology, transparency, and service delivery at the centre of public administration.
Rather than relying on ad hoc initiatives, the focus has been on structural reforms—particularly through the integration of digital systems across government departments. This shift toward e-governance aims at modernising state institutions, reduce discretionary powers, and align provincial administration with contemporary global practices.
As a result, Punjab’s governance framework is now being referenced by other provinces and examined by policy practitioners beyond Pakistan.
A notable feature of the Punjab government has been its emphasis on execution. While government leaders used to announce projects that stalled at the planning stage, the CM Punjab has prioritised initiatives designed for completion within defined timelines.
The approach reflects a move away from symbolic politics toward measurable performance. Developments in public transport, agriculture, education, and administrative reform point to a governance style focused on visible results.
Central to this transformation has been the recognition that effective governance in the modern era depends on robust digital infrastructure.
Under the direction of Chief Minister Maryam, Punjab’s public institutions have undergone a systematic transition from manual, paper-based processes to integrated digital platforms.
Key administrative functions—ranging from ACRs and leave management to postings, transfers, and pension cases—have been consolidated under the e-Filing and Office Automation System. These reforms have not only improved internal efficiency but also strengthened oversight and accountability.
The introduction of e-FOAS and e-procurement has fundamentally altered the pace and transparency of government operations.
READ MORE:CM for carrying out PDP projects strictly in accordance with standards
The traditional file culture, long associated with delays and inefficiencies, has been replaced by paperless workflows that allow real-time tracking and monitoring.
Development projects are assessed against predefined schedules, reducing cost overruns and minimising the lapse of funds. This shift has encouraged a performance-oriented culture within the bureaucracy, reinforcing discipline in both planning and execution.
To further enhance transparency, third-party validation of development schemes has been made mandatory. This mechanism ensures that public funds are utilised not only efficiently but also responsibly.
In parallel, the launch of the e-Biz Portal has simplified regulatory processes for businesses by enabling online acquisition of No Objection Certificates.
By eliminating repeated office visits and discretionary decision-making, the portal has reduced opportunities for corruption while improving the ease of doing business in the province.
Digitization has also reshaped the functioning of the Civil Secretariat and government offices across Punjab.

The conversion of paper-based workflows into digital systems has generated significant savings in administrative costs while improving record management and institutional memory. Through e-FOAS, files are digitally monitored, and delays are automatically flagged to senior management, allowing timely intervention and corrective action. This level of oversight represents a substantive step toward responsive and accountable governance.
Public procurement reforms have followed a similarly comprehensive path. The entire procurement cycle—from advertisement to bid submission and contract award—has been digitised through e-Tendering.
The system enforces compliance with procurement rules, safeguards data integrity, and minimises human intervention. Open access to tender information and digital bidding has promoted competition and transparency, resulting in notable savings for the public exchequer. To support this transition, 14,216 officials from 6,641 different offices across Punjab have been trained in e-procurement procedures.
At present, 23,302 suppliers are registered on the e-procurement platform, and 843,739 procurement activities have already been completed province-wide, underscoring the scale and institutional depth of the reform. It’s satisfying that the institutional capacity-building has supported these reforms, and the e-procurement platform has emerged as a central pillar of public financial management in Punjab.
At the executive level, governance oversight has been strengthened through the establishment of the Chief Minister’s Dashboard at the Chief Minister’s Office. This digital platform enables real-time monitoring of government projects and initiatives, providing live data to support decision-making, transparency, and accountability.
Continuous oversight through the dashboard allows effective tracking of progress, close scrutiny of project transparency, and timely corrective action, reinforcing accountability at the highest level of government.
Citizen-centric services have also undergone significant reform through the launch of the ‘Maryam Ki Dastak’ initiative, a flagship digital service that delivers more than 76 government services directly to citizens’ doorsteps via a mobile application.
Services that once required repeated visits to government offices—including certificates and official documentation—can now be accessed from home with faster processing. Against a target of 2,747,828 services, 2,272,357 services have already been delivered, reflecting strong public uptake and growing trust in digital service delivery.
Transparency and public access to information have also improved through the rapid development of official government websites. To date, 575 websites of government institutions have been completed across Punjab, strengthening public access to information and institutional visibility.
Alongside this, the Chief Minister’s Complaint Cell operates round the clock, enabling registration, monitoring, and resolution of citizen grievances. So far, 647,652 complaints have been received, of which 626,690 have been resolved, reflecting a more responsive and citizen-focused administrative culture.
Land administration, a historically sensitive area of governance, has also seen substantive progress.
The Punjab Government has completed e-registration of approximately 25,000 mauzas, while 77 percent of mauzas across the province have already been digitised. The target of completing full land record digitisation by August 2026 is expected to significantly reduce disputes, manipulation, and uncertainty in revenue records, marking a decisive step toward long-term institutional reform.
Equally consequential has been the restoration of merit in appointments and transfers. Postings across departments, including the police, are governed by defined criteria and performance indicators.
The chief minister’s direct engagement in evaluating senior officers underscores an emphasis on accountability and professional competence. Officers demonstrating strong performance are formally recognised, reinforcing incentives for integrity and service delivery.
Collectively, these reforms point to a governance philosophy anchored in discipline, transparency, and public service. With a stated policy of zero tolerance for corruption, the Punjab Government has sought to institutionalise accountability rather than rely on individual discretion. As the administration completes its second year, Punjab appears better positioned administratively than it was two years ago—supported by digital systems, clearer rules, and a renewed focus on delivery.
Whether these reforms achieve their full potential will depend on continuity and consolidation, but their direction has already begun to reshape the province’s governance landscape.

Addressing the joint sitting of parliament chaired by National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal described Pakistan’s decision to join US-led “Board of Peace” as a diplomatic win and urged lawmakers to celebrate it, despite mounting criticism from opposition benches.
He framed the decision as part of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to play a pivotal role in securing peace in Palestine, alongside other Muslim nations.
In his speech, Iqbal drew parallels with Pakistan’s 1998 nuclear tests, recalling the international pressure the country faced at the time and the courage shown in defending its sovereignty.

“We don’t need anyone to teach us about Pakistan’s defence and integrity,” he declared, emphasising that under the leadership of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan’s sovereignty remains intact.
He also noted that the government and armed forces demonstrated strength during the 2025 India-Pakistan conflict, warning that any adversary would be met with a “befitting reply.”
Turning to the issue of Palestine, Iqbal acknowledged the suffering of Palestinians but insisted that joining the peace initiative was the right course of action.
“If we hadn’t joined the Board of Peace, the opposition would have criticised us for Pakistan’s isolation from global peace efforts,” he argued.
He stressed that Pakistan’s stance on Israel as an aggressor remained unchanged, asserting that the government’s involvement in the peace process was based on its commitment to Palestinian rights.
Iqbal also pointed to the ceasefire achieved between Israel and Hamas, which he said was partially the result of the efforts of eight Muslim nations working with the Trump administration.
“The people of Palestine accepted that ceasefire and began to rebuild their lives,” he added.
However, opposition leaders vehemently opposed the government’s stance as Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, the opposition leader in the Senate, stated that what Netanyahu had failed to achieve was now being pursued under the guise of a “peace board.”
He expressed concern that Pakistan had joined the forum without national consensus and without informing lawmakers about its terms.
“This so-called Peace Board will only add to the suffering of the Palestinians,” he said, accusing Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu of using the platform to further Israeli aggression.
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also lashed out at the decision, alleging that it was driven by “fear of Donald Trump” and would ultimately strengthen Israel’s position against Muslim countries.
He warned that Israel’s aggressive stance would soon turn towards Pakistan after dealing with Hamas and Iran.
Rehman criticised the government for not consulting parliament and cabinet before joining the initiative. “America destroyed Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, and now, Israel will turn its attention to Pakistan,” he warned.
He also drew attention to the issue of Pakistan’s passport restrictions on travel to Israel, questioning why the government was engaging with a state that Pakistan officially does not recognise.
The debate over the Donald Trump-initiated “Board of Peace” was marked by sharp divisions, with opposition leaders denouncing the government’s lack of transparency and accusing it of compromising Pakistan’s national dignity for geopolitical gain.
The opposition further argued that the peace initiative was nothing more than a facade for occupation, with Abbas urging parliament to pass a resolution rejecting the plan.
Despite the growing controversy, the government defended its position, maintaining that its commitment to Palestinian rights and peace in the region remains steadfast.
Meanwhile, the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, strongly condemned the arrest of human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, accusing the government of targeting political dissenters and violating the constitution.
Achakzai denounced the arrest as a direct attack on political freedoms, stating that such actions demonstrated the ongoing suppression of dissent and the continuous erosion of basic civil rights in the country.
“Targeting political dissenters is a clear violation of the constitution,” he said, adding that the government’s use of the law to shield the interests of powerful elite was a troubling trend.
He called for the immediate release of the lawyer couple, demanding a “transparent and impartial” investigation into their arrest.
Ironically, the proceedings of the joint sitting of parliament, which were previously streamed live on National Assembly’s official YouTube channel, mysteriously disappeared from the platform. Additionally, the session was not telecast live on state-run television, raising questions about why this happened.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403789,Corporate sector: restoration of tax neutrality for ICDs under review - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Tax Policy Office, Ministry of Finance is reviewing a proposal of Pakistan Business Council (PBC) to restore tax neutrality for dividends distributed within corporate group structures (Inter-Corporate Dividends) to avoid excessive/multiple taxation on the corporate sector.
In this regard, the PBC has submitted a detailed proposal to the TPO, Ministry of Finance.
According to a communication of the PBC to Dr Najeeb Ahmed Memon, Director General, TPO, the PBC has highlighted restoration of tax neutrality for Inter-Corporate Dividends (ICDs).
The PBC has drawn particular attention to a structural distortion in Pakistan’s tax framework relating to the taxation of ICDs. In this regard, the PBC has requested the restoration of tax neutrality for dividends distributed within corporate group structures, in line with sound tax policy principles and international best practices.
READ MORE:SECP continues to play pivotal role in advancing corporate sector
Under the current tax regime, profits earned by operating subsidiaries are subject to corporate income tax, super tax, and other statutory levies.
When these after-tax profits are distributed to holding companies, they are taxed again as dividends, and upon onward distribution to ultimate shareholders, taxed a third time. This results in cumulative effective taxation approaching 68 percent, leaving investors with approximately Rs32 out of every Rs100 earned at the operating level.
Such excessive multiple taxation significantly inflates the cost of capital, suppresses investment returns, discourages reinvestment of earnings, and incentivizes capital flight toward informal or less transparent structures.
The PBC opined that the current ICD treatment has far-reaching consequences. Investors must generate disproportionately high pre-tax returns merely to match low-risk alternatives, discouraging long-term productive investment.
Even minimal co-investments trigger dividend taxation, discouraging joint ventures, IPOs, and strategic partnerships. In recent instances, potential equity participation has been deferred due to ICD inefficiencies reducing foreign and domestic investment inflows, the PBC maintained.
State-owned entities (SOEs) privatisation: Additional tax layers materially depress enterprise valuations.
Estimates indicated that the Rs 5.5 trillion SOE equity base could suffer valuation discounts of approximately 25 percent, significantly outweighing the modest annual revenue collected from ICD taxation.
The ICD framework introduced in 2007-08 was developed through a structured taskforce comprising representatives from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), Institute of Chartered Accountant of Pakistan (ICAP) and industry experts. Its objective was to prevent multiple taxation of the same income within genuine group structures, in line with global best practices.
The earlier ICD regime included robust safeguards, including minimum effective shareholding thresholds (55 percent for listed groups, 75 percent for unlisted groups); mandatory holding periods to prevent short-term extraction; continuity of business requirements to ensure economic substance; SECP certification of group structures and arm’s-length requirements and exclusions for trading and foreign subsidiaries.
These guardrails ensured that ICD tax neutrality applied only to bonafide operating groups and could not be misused for tax planning.
Global Alignment and Competitiveness International benchmarking shows that developed and developing economies across Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, and Oceania do not tax inter-corporate dividends within bona fide group structures, and typically with far fewer safeguards than those previously embedded in Pakistan’s regime.
Tax neutrality for ICD is a cornerstone of competitive tax systems that encourage scale, diversification, and global competitiveness. Pakistan’s current position places organized, compliant domestic investors at a disadvantage relative to both foreign investors and informal sectors.
The council has requested restoration of tax neutrality for ICDs. for holding companies meeting substantial ownership thresholds (e.g. 55 percent plus effective shareholding), consistent with Pakistan’s earlier framework.
This reform would correct a structural anomaly rather than introduce a new tax concession; unlock domestic and foreign investment; improve SOE privatization outcomes and capital market depth; support formalization, transparency and long-term revenue growth, PBC added.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402930,Japan bond yields rocket on election pledges for tax cuts - Business Recorder,"TOKYO: MostJapanese government bond(JGB) yield shot to record highs on Monday on concerns that an upcoming election will lead to tax cuts that will further weaken the nation’s finances.
The five-year JGB yield soared to an unprecedented 1.69%. The 20-year yield touched 3.265%, while the 30-year yield surged to 3.61%, both all-time highs.
The benchmark 10-year yield surged to as much as 2.275%, the highest since February 1999. Yields move inversely to bond prices.
Monday marks the start of a pivotal week in Japan, with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi set to dissolve parliament and call a snap election early next month, while the central bank meets to set policy.
An official from Takaichi’s Liberal Democratic Party said on Sunday that the party is considering a pledge to abolish sales taxes on groceries for two years. Makoto Nishida, an opposition party official, said on Monday that Japan can permanently eliminate its sales tax on food by generating revenue from a newly created sovereign wealth fund.
The reported tax cut plan would “impact government spending, which would affect sentiment for the super-long-dated JGBs,” said Keisuke Tsuruta, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
“Even shorter-dated JGBs will be affected by the news, as concerns about the nation’s worsening fiscal health drive the yen weaker and raise bets for a rate hike by the BOJ.”
The BOJ is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at the close of its meeting on Friday. But some central bank policymakers see scope to raise interest rates sooner than markets expect to contend with the weak yen, sources told Reuters.
The two-year yield, the one most sensitive to BOJ policy rates, increased to 1.215%, the highest in LSEG data going back to 2001.

This development came at a crucial time, as Pakistan has agreed to conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to make the asset declarations of high-level officials publicly available.
The government had pledged to make these declarations accessible online by December 2026.
The National Assembly also passed “The Corporate Social Responsibility Bill, 2026”, bringing the banking sector and state-owned enterprises under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which requires large and profitable companies to spend one percent of their profits on CSR activities.

Shazia Atta Marri and Dr Nafisa Shah of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) separately tabled the Elections (Amendment) Bill, 2026, and the Corporate Social Responsibility Bill, 2026, as private members’ bills in the House. The House passed the both bills with majority votes.
According to clause six of the bill which amends the section 138 of “The Elections Act, 2017,” “Provided that the Speaker of the concerned Assembly or, as the case may be, the chairman of the senate, on an application made by a member and for reasons to be recorded in writing, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the Commission if such publication pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the members or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.
According to the bill, the role of election disputes is being given to the Federal Constitutional Court. Under the approved amendments, several sections of the Elections Act, 2017 have been revised to replace the term “Supreme Court” with “Federal Constitutional Court”.
Section 9 has been amended to include the Federal Constitutional Court. Section 66 now formally brings the court within the jurisdiction framework. Section 104 and 104A have been amended to assign election dispute matters to the Federal Constitutional Court.
As a result, election-related appeals, disputes, and legal interpretation under election laws will now fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court, which was established under the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The bill now needs approval from the Senate and the President’s assent before it becomes law. However, the opposition opposed the Elections (Amendment) Bill, 2026.
During the debate, Acting Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Barrister Gohar opposed the bill, arguing that routine election matters were being shifted from the Supreme Court to the Constitutional Court unnecessarily.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403260/oil-prices-dip-on-supply-build-expectations-greenland-tension,"Oil prices dip on supply build expectations, Greenland tension - Business Recorder","LONDON:Oil pricesdipped on Wednesday as investors assessed expectations of a build in U.S. crude inventories, a temporary shutdown at two large fields in Kazakhstan and fresh geopolitical tension tied to U.S. tariff threats in its bid to gain control of Greenland.
Brent futures were down 12 cents, or 0.2%, to $64.80 a barrel at 1125 GMT. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude contract was down 11 cents, also 0.2%, at $60.25 a barrel.
Both contracts closed about 1.5% higher in the previous session after OPEC+ producer Kazakhstan halted output at the Tengiz and Korolev oilfields on Sunday due to power distribution issues. Strong Chinese economic data was also positive.
Oil production at the two Kazakh fields could be halted for another seven to 10 days, three industry sources told Reuters.
The oil output halt at Tengiz, one of the world’s largest oilfields, and Korolev is temporary, and downward pressure from an expected rise in U.S. crude inventories along with geopolitical tension will persist, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said on Wednesday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was “no going back” on his goal to control Greenland. Last week he vowed to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the U.S. is allowed to buy the Arctic island.
The increased geopolitical tensions, which add pressure to the oil markets as tariffs could slow economic growth, were adding to risk-off sentiment, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.
U.S. crude oil and gasoline stockpiles were expected to have risen last week, while distillate inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
Six analysts polled by Reuters estimated on average that crude inventories rose by about 1.7 million barrels in the week to January 16.
The American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory data is due at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT) on Wednesday, and figures from the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, are due at 12 p.m. EST (1700 GMT) on Thursday, both a day later due to a U.S. federal holiday on Monday.
While such inventory growth would be negative for oil prices, Gregory Brew, senior analyst with the Eurasia Group consultancy, said the potential for U.S.-Iran tensions to re-escalate would be supportive.
Trump threatened to strike Iran over its violent crackdown on anti-government protests earlier this month.

A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries – including Pakistan – gathered on stage with Trump to put their names to the founding charter of the body.
Officials from Bahrain, Morocco, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Argentina, Hungary, Bulgaria, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Mongolia also signed the document with Trump.

Trump – who is the chairman of the Board of Peace – said they were “in most cases very popular leaders, some cases not so popular. That’s the way it goes in life.”
Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after the war between Hamas and Israel, the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts, sparking concerns that Trump wants it to rival the United Nations.
Trump however said the organisation would work “in conjunction” with the UN.
The Board of Peace’s potential membership has however proved controversial, with Trump having invited Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine four years ago.
Trump said Putin had agreed to join, while the Russian leader said he was still studying the invite.
Permanent members must also pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay to play” version of the UN Security Council.
Key US allies including France and Britain have expressed skepticism, with the UK saying Thursday it would not attend the ceremony.
The members on stage largely held close ties to Trump, including Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Argentina’s Javier Milei, or a wish to show their allegiance to the US president.
READ MORE:Trump tells Davos that Europe is heading in wrong direction
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over the war in Gaza, has said he will join but was not at the ceremony.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the ceremony that the board’s focus was “first and foremost on making sure that this peace deal in Gaza becomes enduring.”
Trump however said Hamas to disarm under the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire accord or it will be the “end of them.”
The launch of the board comes against the backdrop of Trump’s frustration at having failed to win the Nobel Peace Prize, despite his disputed claim to have ended eight conflicts.
The inclusion of Putin has caused particular concern among US allies, but especially in Ukraine as it seeks an end to Moscow’s nearly four-year-old invasion.
Trump will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos after the “Board of Peace” ceremony to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine – the major peace deal that continues to elude him.
Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is due to travel to Moscow to meet Putin later Thursday, said in Davos that talks to end the war had made a “lot of progress” and were down to one issue.
“I think we’ve got it down to one issue, and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it’s solvable,” said Witkoff, without saying what the issue was.
Witkoff added that he and the US leader’s son-in-law Jared Kushner would not stay in Moscow overnight but fly straight to Abu Dhabi for “military to military” talks.
Zelensky has meanwhile voiced fears that Trump’s push to seize Greenland – which has dominated Davos so far and threatened to unravel the transatlantic alliance – could divert focus away from Russia’s invasion of his country.
Trump however said late Wednesday he had reached a “framework of a future deal” after meeting NATO chief Mark Rutte, and that he would therefore waive tariffs scheduled to hit European allies on February 1.
He gave no further details, leaving Europeans drawing only cautious sighs of relief.

He comes from a business family with roots in pre-Partition India, with earlier generations involved in trade, industry, and Pakistan’s early economic development, including support to Muhammad Ali Jinnah and early engagement with international industry figures such as Henry Ford.
Following are the edited excerpts of a recent conversation BR Research had with him:
BR Research:TREET has different business segments—razors, batteries, soap, pharma, packaging. Which of these are your main focus for the future versus the others and why?
Syed Sheharyar Ali:All our businesses have strong potential—packaging, pharma, batteries, and solar are all growing—but what excites me most is blades and shaving, because that is our core and our heritage. Treet is a 73-year-old brand that my father’s generation knows well, but younger consumers don’t relate to it in the same way, which is a real business risk.
Genesis is our way of rebuilding that relevance. It allows us to create a premium brand from scratch—something we’ve never done before—while still leveraging the credibility of the Treet umbrella. For the first time, we are not just competing locally; we are stepping up to international-quality benchmarks and telling a new, modern story for a new generation.
BRR: You have launched new brands like Genesis and Estella. Why not just launch new SKUs under the traditional “Treet” name?
SSA: Because Treet as a brand has historically been positioned for the masses—everyday use, value-driven, widely accessible. For Genesis, we wanted a different identity: premium, modern, aspirational. If we launched it purely as another Treet SKU, it would inherit the same perception.
So, we chose “Genesis”, with an association with Treet in our communications, to get the best of both worlds: (1) it can stand on its own as a premium brand, and (2) it still carries the strength, heritage, and credibility of the Treet umbrella. That standalone premium feel was a deliberate strategy, not a cosmetic change.
BRR: Pakistan is a very price-sensitive market. How will a premium shaving brand win share here—especially against imported and Western brands? And why launch Genesis now—why not five years ago? Was this linked to multinational exits or a change in strategy?
SSA: Even in a price-sensitive market like Pakistan, there is always a segment that is willing to pay for better quality, experience, and appearance. While that segment is smaller than in international markets, it is growing—and Genesis has been positioned precisely for it. We are offering quality comparable to leading international brands like Gillette, but at roughly a 30 percent lower price, making it premium in positioning but still strong on value. The rising “Made in Pakistan” sentiment also works in our favour, as consumers are increasingly willing to choose high-quality local brands.
Availability is another key advantage. Smuggled and imported products exist, but they are often inconsistent in supply, especially when it comes to replacement cartridges. Our ability to provide reliable availability across the country gives us a strong competitive edge.
This launch is not driven by recent multinational exits. We have been developing Genesis for over two years, and it reflects a deeper shift inside Treet itself. Over the last five years, we have moved from being a volume-driven company to a value-driven one. That change is visible in how we invest, how we build brands, and how we compete—and Genesis is the first major expression of that new strategy.
BRR: What is the domestic market you’re targeting for Genesis—and will it cannibalize your existing Treet razor/blade business?
READ MORE:Treet Corp revises launch date for two personal care brands
SSA: We are targeting the premium segment that used to be served by brands like Gillette and others—roughly the 15–20 percent share of the market that sits above the mass segment. We do not see Genesis cannibalizing our existing Treet offerings because it is aimed at a different consumer segment with a different buying behaviour.
This is not about shifting our current customer from Treet to Genesis. It’s about capturing the premium segment that we historically didn’t own. In other words, Genesis should take share from premium imported or international-equivalent brands, not from our own base.
BRR: You mentioned international markets are the “real challenge.” Why is that, and what will it take to compete globally?
SSA: Internationally, the competitive bar is higher and the market is deeper. Domestically, we are confident we can offer a strong proposition: high quality at an attractive price point, improved distribution, and a local brand story. Globally, the challenge is competing on complete systems and ensuring we have everything in-house.
Blade manufacturing is our strength. But for system razors, handles and cartridge assembly matter a lot. Historically, our weakness was in handle-making and cartridge assembly. With Genesis, we have plans to bring those capabilities in-house, because once you control the full system, you can compete much more effectively internationally.
BRR: Given TREET’s strong global reputation in blade manufacturing, what share of your revenues currently comes from exports, how do you see that evolving over the next few years, and what is your core competitive advantage in blades that allows you to defend and grow that position internationally?
SSA: Exports currently account for about 20–30 percent of our revenues, with the rest coming from the local market. We were once closer to a 50–50 split, but exports declined as the global market shifted from basic shaving formats to system razors, where we were not fully present. That is now changing. Our goal is to take exports back to 50% or more within the next three to five years, and our five-year growth plan is built around that international expansion as we bring more of the system-razor value chain in-house in coming years.
Our core advantage is blade manufacturing. High-quality blades are extremely difficult to make at scale—only six to eight companies worldwide can do it well, and we are one of them. Even China, despite its manufacturing strength, has not been able to match our edge quality, which is why it is actually one of our largest export markets—Chinese manufacturers import our blades to use in their own razors. That speaks to the depth and defensibility of our technology.
BRR: Trends like “beard fashion” changed shaving habits globally. Over the last decade, has this impacted your sales and demand profile?
SSA: Beard fashion did grow, but it didn’t eliminate razor use—people still shave necklines, edges, and facial contours. The market shifted, it didn’t disappear. More recently, we’re also seeing heavier beard trends ease and shaving return among younger consumers, with self-grooming supporting growth in system razors. Overall, the trend changed how razors are used, not the underlying demand.
BRR: You are entering women’s hygiene with “Estella.” What convinced you the opportunity is real in Pakistan despite cultural taboos?
SSA: Internationally, women’s razors account for 20–30 percent of the market, but in Pakistan the segment has been largely under-served and rarely discussed—even though the demand exists. We are launching a full women’s range covering eyebrow, face, body, and hygiene shavers. What really validated the opportunity for us was that our best-selling online SKU is a women’s eyebrow razor—despite zero marketing.
With Genesis and Estella, we will run a 360-degree campaign to educate consumers and build awareness. Once education and availability come together, we believe the women’s segment can become a meaningful new revenue stream, precisely because it fills a major gap in the market.
BRR: You’re launching about 35 SKUs at once. What does the launch footprint look like—and why launch everything together?
SSA: We are launching roughly 35 SKUs spanning from two-blade system razors and disposables up to five-blade premium systems. We’re also introducing a niche “cut-throat” style single-blade shaving concept for people who treat shaving as an experience—like the hot towel shave ritual.
What’s new for us is the scale and coordination: these SKUs will be available in 800+ outlets at the same time. This is the first time in TREET’s history we’re doing a synchronized launch of this breadth. It signals seriousness to the market, improves consumer visibility, and supports the premium brand-building goal.
BRR: You’re also entering grooming products (face washes, deodorants, shaving gels, etc.). Is this a revenue play or a brand-building play?
SSA: It’s mainly about brand-building and portfolio completeness. Grooming is new for us, and while these products may not be big revenue drivers initially, a full range helps position us as a complete grooming brand, not just a razor company. With a young, image-conscious population and rising focus on personal care, we see grooming as a natural and growing extension of our portfolio.
BRR: A few years back, TREET was seen as financially stressed—leveraged, expanding into new verticals, hit by interest rates and COVID. What went wrong, and what did you learn?
SSA: The biggest lesson is simple: never over-leverage, no matter how confident you are. We were over-leveraged, and then a sequence of external shocks hit—interest rates moved from roughly 9–10 percent to 24 percent, currency parity shifted sharply, and COVID disrupted operations. At the same time, we entered three new verticals we didn’t fully understand, and we did it too quickly.
How did we recover? We took painful corrective steps—debt restructuring, and yes, selling personal assets to meet obligations. But the core turnaround was operational: we built a stronger professional team—finance, supply chain, marketing, and others —and changed how the company runs. We moved from operational losses to consolidated profitability, and the difference between then and now is night and day.
BRR: Over the next few years, how do you plan to finance growth—profits, debt, equity, or something else?
SSA: It will be a mix. Profitability now gives us room to reinvest internally. But understand that a major expansion in production or technology may need more —where we bring experience and operational strength, and partners bring capital. Some expansion may still involve debt, but we’re much more careful now given what we learned.
We’re also reviewing our investment structure in subsidiaries. For instance, in the battery business we don’t necessarily need to hold 90 percent ownership; we can reduce shareholding while retaining control—similar to how we’ve structured other parts—so we can unlock capital without creating excessive leverage.
BRR: Let’s talk about batteries. With UPS demand falling but solar storage growing, how is your battery business evolving?
SSA: Battery has been growing and performing better than many peers. Historically, a big part of the business comes from the automotive side—around 60%—and the rest from UPS/backup. UPS demand has shrunk, but automotive demand has increased, which has hedged the business.
The bigger shift now is technology: lithium-ion is the future. Prices have come down substantially over the last 2–3 years, and with solarization expanding, demand for storage solutions will rise. We’ve partnered with a major Chinese manufacturer to launch lithium-ion batteries plus inverters—about five SKUs across different sizes, including tower and wall-mounted solutions.
We will start with imported solutions first so we can learn what works locally—what SKUs click, which don’t. After that, we plan to assemble locally, and eventually, we want to develop battery management systems in Pakistan too.
BRR: In lithium-ion, dozens of importers are already in the market. What makes you confident you can win?
SSA: Two strengths - distribution and trust. Lithium-ion warranties are long—three years up to ten years. So, the real question for consumers is: will the seller exist in five years to honour the claim? Many of the new importers might not.
Treet as a group has 70+years of history. That credibility matters in a warranty-driven product. We believe we can build a stronger, more reliable value proposition for consumers compared to short-lived sellers who may not sustain quality and service.
BRR: You were early in maintenance-free automotive batteries. How does the first-mover advantage help today?
SSA: The market has two broad categories: maintained traditional batteries and maintenance-free. While competitors also sell maintenance-free now, we are number one by volume in maintenance-free due to early investment and branding.
Maintenance-free is a growing segment and will ultimately replace maintained batteries—Pakistan is one of the few countries where maintained automotive batteries still exist at scale. Our leadership there has also provided a financial cushion during industry price wars, and our earlier pivot towards automotive away from backup helped us ride out volatility better than others.
BRR: Your pharma business holds a large domestic share in haemodialysis concentrates. What is the growth plan—especially exports?
SSA: Pharma is doing well and is largely an export play. Domestically, we already have about 60–70 percent market share in haemodialysis concentrates, so growth will increasingly come from exports.
We had a slow start because we moved facilities and had to update registrations, certifications, and compliance documentation—medical products require that rigor. But our facility is among the latest and largest in the segment, and Pakistan’s cost base is meaningfully lower than many other markets. Over the next six to twelve months, we expect stronger results as those regulatory and registration transitions settle.
BRR: How serious is the problem of smuggling and counterfeiting, and how do you respond operationally?
SSA: It’s serious and it has two layers: (1) counterfeiting of our products and (2) smuggled products competing unfairly. We have built an in-house team to identify counterfeit production points. We collaborate withgovernment authorities with market intelligence, who thenraid, seal facilities, and pursue legal action. On average, this collaboration is shutting down roughly one counterfeit factory per month.
For smuggled products in markets, we often start with education. Many shopkeepers don’t even realize they’re stocking counterfeit or smuggled goods. We meet market leadership, explain the illegality and the harm (including the loss of duties/taxes), and most markets cooperate. If education doesn’t work, we involve law enforcement.
At the same time, we believe one structural fix is needed: a dedicated government cell focused on counterfeit and smuggling across industries—because when you raid one facility, you may find multiple counterfeit product lines under one roof, but agencies only act on the complaint they received.
BRR: Costs in Pakistan keep rising. What are the main ways TREET is protecting profit margins—energy, local sourcing, automation, productivity, or price?
SSA: We are focusing on three big levers: solarization, localization, and automation.
Energy is one of our largest costs. Both major plants have been solarized. We have about 1.2 MW solar at the Treet plant and over 2 MW at the battery plant, reducing power cost by more than 50 percent relative to requirement.
Localization is also key. Some inputs—like specialized steel for blades—cannot be localized because the domestic industry cannot produce that grade. But we are localizing everything possible: terminals, plastic parts, and other components that previously had to be imported.
Automation is another lever. There was a time when manual labour was the cheaper option; that’s no longer automatically true. We are pushing for higher productivity through automation and process redesign. The result is important: despite cost pressures, our profitability has improved, not declined—both in local and export segments.
BRR: Pakistan is often described as an over-regulated economy. Which regulatory or compliance burdens hurt TREET the most, and how do they affect competitiveness?
SSA: The hardest part is not regulation itself—it’s the uneven enforcement and uneven compliance across competitors. We pay our taxes fully, we maintain certifications, we comply. But when competitors can evade taxes, under-invoice imports, or bypass standards, they can sell at prices that are sometimes even below our cost of production.
That distorts the market and slows honest companies down. In some segments, we feel it took us years just to reach break-even partly because the “playing field” wasn’t level. If compliance and tax enforcement were consistent across the board, it would improve competitiveness, expand the revenue base of the country, and reward companies that operate transparently.
BRR: What is your core message to policymakers and regulators—what single change would improve the industrial environment the most?
SSA: A level playing field. Either reduce duties and simplify the structure in a way that makes compliance easier—or enforce compliance consistently so everyone pays their share. We are fine paying taxes; we already do. But it must become the norm.
Smuggling and counterfeiting are serious, but we can manage them with enforcement and market education. The bigger issue is when large competitors can operate outside the same rules—because then the industry becomes structurally unfair, and honest investment is punished.","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:15:30 GMT",,tax automation,"Syed Sheharyar Ali is the CEO of Treet Corporation Limited and is based in Lahore.

The program encompassed customer accounts records across 105 branches and was executed with zero critical data loss within six months, ensuring complete accuracy, reconciliation, and uninterrupted operational continuity.
The initiative addressed significant technical challenges, including high-volume data processing within restricted banking windows, complex mapping across account structures, branch codes, customer identifiers, and GL/symbol hierarchies, as well as the remediation of legacy data quality issues. To accelerate repeatable conversion cycles and reduce cutover risk, AUTON8 utilised MORPH to configure governed transformation logic between source and target structures, enabling the rapid refinement of mapping rules across dry runs with consistent outcomes carried into the final migration.
Farasat Ali Naqvi, EVP Core Banking at UBL, said the successful completion of this migration within 6 months represents a significant milestone for UBL. AUTON8 MORPH proved to be a game-changer for us, with its no-code, governed and traceable transformation approach made it possible to deliver this outcome at speed. AUTON8’s structured execution ensured data integrity, minimized operational risk and enabled a smooth post-migration transition, he added.
Ali Raza, Chief Operating Officer at AUTON8, said that this project reflects AUTON8’s strength in delivering mission-critical banking transformations under tight timelines. Migrating customer records across 105 branches between two entirely different core banking systems, while ensuring zero critical data loss, demonstrates our automation-led execution and deep banking domain expertise. AUTON8 MORPH—our no-code transformation platform—enabled governed, fully traceable mapping and conversion at scale, which is how we delivered within such a compressed timeframe, he added.
The successful delivery of this project reinforces AUTON8’s position as a trusted transformation partner for large-scale banking data migrations, enabling financial institutions to modernize core platforms while safeguarding accuracy, resilience, and customer continuity.
It is pertinent to mention here the merger of the United Bank Limited and Silk Bank took place last year under the supervision of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403407,PPA rejects FED on day-old chicks - Business Recorder,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) has expressed serious concern over the government’s decision to retain a Federal Excise Duty (FED) of Rs. 10 on day-old chicks, terming it a punitive and regressive measure that threatens the sustainability of the poultry sector and the food security of millions of Pakistanis.
The Association warned that the imposition of FED at the very start of the production cycle has sharply increased input costs, forcing many breeders and hatcheries to divert fertile eggs for sale as table eggs instead of incubation. Given the biological production cycle of poultry, reduced chick placement today will inevitably result in a severe shortage of chicken meat within the next 6 to 8 weeks. This shortage is expected to trigger unprecedented spikes in retail chicken prices, further restricting access to affordable animal protein for low-income households and exacerbating nutritional insecurity.
Punjab, which serves as the backbone of Pakistan’s poultry industry, will be particularly affected. Continued enforcement of such regressive taxation is likely to push small and medium poultry farms out of business, leading to widespread job losses, declining rural incomes, and significant economic distress across farming communities. The PPA further emphasized that under the prevailing legal framework, Federal Excise Duty cannot be levied on the production or sale of live animals, as such taxation lacks statutory backing and is inconsistent with the Constitution of Pakistan.
PPA issued this statement during media briefing addressed by its Chairman Abdul Basit, Group Leader Dr F M Sabir, Vice Chairman Malik Muhammad Sharif, along with senior industry representatives Khalique Arshad and Dr Sajjad Arshad.
Addressing the media, PPA Chairman Abdul Basit described the levy as a regressive tax that strikes at the very foundation of poultry production. “Imposing a Rs. 10 FED on a day-old chick is a catastrophic decision and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the poultry industry’s dynamics. This is not merely a tax on farmers; it is effectively a tax on the food plate of every Pakistani who depends on chicken as the most affordable source of animal protein,” he stated.
Group Leader and CEO of Sabir Poultry, Dr F M Sabir, highlighted that the industry is already under immense pressure due to high electricity tariffs and escalating feed costs, particularly stemming from restrictions on soybean imports.
The poultry sector contributes over 40 percent of Pakistan’s total meat consumption and is central to national food security. By imposing a fixed duty at the hatchery level, the government is driving small-scale farmers out of the market, which will inevitably lead to supply shortages and sharp increases in consumer prices,” he warned.
Vice Chairman PPA Malik Muhammad Sharif noted that the industry is facing a severe survival crisis. He pointed out that production costs have risen to Rs. 350–380 per kilogram, while market volatility often prevents farmers from recovering these costs.
Senior industry representatives Khalique Arshad and Dr. Sajjad Arshad urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Ministry of Finance to immediately reconsider the levy. They noted that even international stakeholders, including the IMF, have previously questioned narrowly targeted industry taxes that neither broaden the tax base nor support essential food production.
The Association also appealed the Prime Minister and the Federal Finance Minister to initiate meaningful dialogue with industry stakeholders and to formulate a stable, growth-oriented policy framework.

High-frequency indicators are data collected frequently, such as goods and services tax (GST) receipts and e-way bills, among others, that point to economic activity.
The central bank noted that overall demand conditions remain strong, driven by a revival in rural demand and a gradual recovery in urban demand.
A strong rebound in the manufacturing sector and continued buoyancy in services are expected to boost growth in gross value added.
Retail automobile sales showed broad-based growth across categories due to the cuts in GST, further bolstering rural demand.

“Even amidst these global uncertainties, the current state of the economy provides ground for optimism going forward,” the report stated.
The GDP growth estimates for 2025-26 indicate that India will remain the fastest-growing major economy in the world, it said.
RBI has projected GDP growth at 7.3% for fiscal year 2026 ending March 31, while for the next fiscal year, growth is expected at 6.7% and 6.8% for the first and second quarters, respectively.
Economic activity continued to register a strong growth in December. E-way bill generation recorded healthy expansion, supported by GST rate rationalisation, alongside stock clearance and firms’ efforts to meet year-end sales targets.
Growth in GST revenue collections was primarily driven by higher import-related GST receipts, the bulletin added.
The International Monetary Fund on Monday revised its growth forecast for India upwards by 0.7 percentage points to 7.3%, citing strong momentum, but said it is likely to slow to 6.4% in the following two fiscal years as cyclical factors fade.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402990/ntc-concludes-probe-anti-dumping-duties-imposed-on-cefadroxil-imports,NTC concludes probe: Anti-dumping duties imposed on Cefadroxil imports - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The National Tariff Commission (NTC) has imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on dumped imports of Cefadroxil into Pakistan originating in and/ or exported from China. The Commission initiated this anti-dumping investigation on May 21, 2025. The final determination is based on the information collected and/or obtained by the Commission during the investigation.
According to NTC, the individual dumping margin has been determined based on information submitted by M/s Anglikang. A residual dumping margin for all the non-cooperating exporters/producers from China is determined on the basis of best available information in terms of Section 32 of the Act.
For the purpose of imposition of lesser duty in terms of Section 50 (2) of the Act the Commission has calculated injury margins in accordance with Rule 21 of the Rules to ascertain whether a lower duty would be adequate to remove injury being suffered by the domestic industry due to dumped imports of investigated product.
Calculations of injury margin are as follows: (i) cost to make and sell of the domestic like product (Rs/kg) 100.00; (ii) profit: 5 percent of cost to make and sell 5.00; (iii) estimated Non-injurious price of the domestic like product (Rs/kg) 105.00; (iv) C&F price of investigated product (Rs/kg) 78.30; (v) landed cost of investigated product (Rs/ kg) 84.94; (vi) absolute injury margin (Rs/kg) 20.06; and (vii) Injury Margin as % of C&F Price 25.61.
The NTC argued that the injury margin worked out at 25.61 percent, which is above the dumping margin determined for the M/s Anglikang and non-cooperating exporters/producers from China. Thus, in terms of Section 50 (2) of the Act, lesser duty would be adequate to remove injury to the domestic industry. Therefore, the Commission, pursuant to powers under Section 50 of the Act, decided to impose definitive anti-dumping duties at the rates on C&F value in ad valorem terms on imports of the investigated product imported from China for a period of five years effective from September 17, 2025. However, in accordance with Section 51(ea) of the Act, definitive anti-dumping duty will not be levied on imports of the investigated product that are used as inputs in products destined solely for exports or for use in the foreign grant-in-aid projects and are covered under any scheme exempting customs duties for exports or foreign grant-in-aid projects under the Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969).
The investigated product is classified under PCT heading No. 2941.9090.
Definitive anti-dumping duty rates are as follows: (i) M/s Zhejiang Anglikang Pharmaceuticals 8.61 percent; and (ii) all other exporters/foreign producers 11.81 percent.
The investigated product imported from sources other than China shall not be subject to the above-mentioned definitive anti-dumping duties.
Furthermore, as the definitive anti-dumping duty rates for all exporters/foreign producers from China are lower as compared to provisional duty rates claims for refund of difference between provisional anti-dumping duty and final anti-dumping duty with respect to the import of the investigated product would be entertained, if claimed, within the stipulated time period under Section 55(2) of the Act.
In accordance with Section 51 of the Act, the definitive anti-dumping duties shall take the form of ad valorem duty and be held in a non-lapsable personal ledger account established and maintained by the Commission for this purpose.
The release of the investigated product shall be subject to imposition of such anti-dumping duty.
Definitive anti-dumping duties levied would be in addition to other taxes and duties leviable on import of the investigated product under any other law.
The definitive anti-dumping duties would be collected in the same manner as Customs duty is collected under the Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969) and would be deposited in Commission’s Non-Lapsable PLD Account.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402854/traders-concerned-at-suspension-of-trade-with-afghanistan,Traders concerned at suspension of trade with Afghanistan - Business Recorder,"PESHAWAR: Businessmen from Pakistan and Afghanistan have termed the three-month closure of cross-border trade between the two neighbouring countries as disastrous for the regional economy, urging authorities to review the decision and allow resumption of commercial activities for the benefit of millions of affected people.
Senior Vice President of Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), Zia-ul-Haq Sarhadi, And Executive Member Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), Former SVP Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Engr, Manzoor Elahi and Ahmad Shah Yarzada, Board Director PAJCCI Afghan chapter in a joint statement here on Sunday said that irreparable losses caused due to closure of trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan has affected the lives of millions of people due to its negative impact on the economy of the region.
“The ground reality is that hundreds of millions of people in the region live below the poverty line, and closure of bilateral and transit trade has only added fuel to the fire by deepening their hardships,” observed members of the business communities of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
It is a known and established fact that both the business community of Afghanistan and Pakistan are on the same page and they wanted to expand their business with each other both in terms of bilateral and transit trade, but unfortunately the traders, exporters, farmers are the innocent victims of the policy decision.
Trade should be kept separate from politics, as bilateral and transit trade sustains millions of poor families across the region. However, the continued suspension of trade has deprived countless households of their livelihoods, making it increasingly difficult for parents to provide food and education for their children, they added.
There are over 10,000 containers of Afghan Transit trade cargo stranded inside Pakistan exposed to heavy demurrage and detention charges for the past three months. Similarly there are thousands of trucks of Pakistan transit cargo from Central Asia stranded inside Afghanistan.
The current situation is not bearable for the business community of both Afghanistan and Pakistan, they remarked.
Sharing data of losses incurred by both Afghanistan and Pakistan due to the closure of trade, the businessmen said Afghanistan is the nearest market for Pakistani products with advance payment before delivery of goods, which means a market which pays full payment in advance.
The export volume of Pakistan to Afghanistan is USD 1.5 billion per annum. Since the trade stopped for the past 3 months it has inflicted a loss of USD 375 million to Pakistani exporters.
The export volume of Pakistan via Afghanistan to central Asia is USD 900 million per annum. The closure of the trade caused losses of USD 225 million to Pakistan exporters, they added.
The import of commercial goods from Central Asia to Pakistan was very cost effective, but the closure of trade caused considerable price increases in the market due to supply lines disturbed.
Pakistan lost billions of rupees in terms of import customs duty, taxes for imports cargo from Afghanistan and Central Asia, the businessmen claimed.
Referring to use of Karachi ports for Afghan transit trade, they said Afghanistan import volume as transit via Karachi is around 40,000-45,000 containers per annum.
The average transit cost for each container under the heads of transport, insurance guarantee, terminal handling charges, port charges, clearing agents, forwarders, transit facility charges & etc is USD 4,000.
There are over 10,000 containers of transit cargo stranded in Pakistan and the above cargo is exposed to heavy demurrage and detention charges.
Each single container is charged around USD 120 on a daily basis.
Afghan importers are faced with loss of USD 1.2 million as penalty charges on daily basis for the demurrage, detention. The losses for the past 3 months are USD 108 million.
Afghanistan export volume to Pakistan is USD 800 million per annum closure of the trade has inflicted loss of USD 200 million to Afghan exporters. Afghanistan export to India Via Wagah is around USD 300 million per annum.
While due to closure of the trade, transit has inflicted loss of USD 75 million USD to Afghanistan exporters. Afghanistan lost billions of Afghani Rupee in terms of import customs duties & taxes due to stoppage of the transit cargo inside Pakistan.
The demand of traders, farmers, importers, exporters and all the related sectors across the border both from Pakistan & Afghanistan is to take a review of the current disastrous situation and reopen the trade transit for the stranded cargo on the pipeline.
The businessmen from both the countries said the re- export of the transit trade cargo back to the port of origin is a very complex and costly procedure and will further hurt the business community.
They reiterated their request addressed to both Afghanistan and Pakistan authorities to review tough stands and help allow the trade/transit in the region which is helpful for the region in terms of poverty and security.

Ministry of Industries and Production has held meetings with 32 women chambers so that the untapped and hidden potential of the national economy could be made productive.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402764,Welfare of labourers undoubtedly a provincial subject: FCC - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) said welfare of labour, not mentioned in the Federal Legislative List of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, is undoubtedly a provincial subject.
Balochistan Provincial Assembly amended Section 3 of the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour Welfare) Act, 1967 through Section 7 of the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020, revising the rates of excise duty. The Balochistan Mines Labour Welfare Department; therefore demanded from the petitioners (Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd and others) to pay excise duty on minerals at the rates revised pursuant to the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020.
The petitioners assailed the impugned legislation before the Balochistan High Court, which upheld it. Thus, they approached the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, which was transferred to the FCC upon the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
READ MORE:Judiciary, executive bodies: After 27th Amendment interpretations ‘uniformly applied’: FCC
The petitioners counsel argued before the FCC that Provincial Assembly, by amending Section 3 of the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour Welfare) Act, 1967 through Section 7 of the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020, acted without legislative competence. It was also contended that the imposition of excise duty is a subject within the exclusive Federal Legislative domain; therefore, the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan lacked the authority to amend the 1967 Act, particularly when such amendment effectively alters the rate or nature of excise duty.
The judgment, authored by Justice Aamir Farooq, noted that the imposition of excise duty falls within the federal domain, as Entry 44 of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, 1973 confers exclusive competence upon the federal legislature.
However, welfare of labour, as not mentioned in the Federal Legislative List of the Fourth Schedule and not falling in any ancillary domain of the Federal Government, is undoubtedly a Provincial subject.
The judgment said viewed from the fiscal aspect, the imposition of excise duty squarely falls within federal legislative competence; viewed from the “public interest” aspect, the advancement of labour welfare lies well within the provincial domain. Consequently, both enactments stand on firm constitutional footing, not in conflict but in constitutional harmony, each valid in its own aspect.
It said that Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution 1973, consciously embraced the ethos of cooperative federalism wherein legislative fields are not rigid silos but at times interacting spheres. In this constitutional landscape, incidental overlap does not render a statute ultra vires.
The judgment noted that the objective of the 1967 Act is undoubtedly oriented toward the advancement of labour welfare; a domain constitutionally entrusted to the provinces. The mechanism through which this objective is pursued is the imposition of a duty of excise, not as an end in itself, but as a means carefully fashioned to finance a broader “public interest”.
The judgment said that the impugned statute neither encroaches upon nor displaces federal legislative authority; rather, it operates within a constitutionally permissible overlap to advance a legitimate provincial objective. Its fiscal mechanism serves as an ancillary means to realise a substantive purpose squarely rooted in labour welfare.
The statute does not merely levy a tax; it constructs an administrative framework for the collection, allocation, and utilisation of the proceeds, all of which are inextricably linked to the welfare of labour employed in the industry. Thus, while the recovery of excise duty is the operative mechanism of the Act, its spirit, essential character, and constitutional essence lie in the realization of labour welfare.
To strike down such legislation would be to adopt a rigid and formalistic approach, inconsistent with constitutional design. The Act; therefore, represents a lawful and harmonious exercise of legislative power, it concluded.

He expressed this while addressing a press conference at Federation House on Monday, where he was accompanied by other business leaders, including Khalid Tawab, Atiq Mir and others.
Expressing deep grief over the incident, Atif Ikram Sheikh said traders suffered losses worth billions of rupees. He said the fire could not be extinguished due to a lack of modern firefighting equipment and shortage of water, and raised serious questions over the role of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA).
He announced that FPCCI would provide Rs50 million for the affected people and said a fundraising program would also be launched for their rehabilitation.
FPCCI Vice President Saqib Fayaz Maggo said around 1,200 shops were reduced to ashes, holding government mismanagement responsible for the incident.
He said the Sindh Building Control Authority failed to perform its duties, while fire tenders did not reach the site on time and the fire brigade staff was unaware of the nature of the fire.
He added that traders should also adopt fire safety measures. He pointed out that Karachi has only 22 fire stations and 49 fire tenders, many of which are non-functional. He demanded an increase in the number of fire stations and fire tenders and appreciated the Sindh government’s announcement to reconstruct the building.
Maggo demanded the formation of a committee comprising representatives of the government and the business community and called for strict punishment for those responsible.
He also urged the Sindh government to immediately restore and improve the rescue management system and demanded special tax relief for the affected traders.
He further said that a fire incident also occurred at Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT), where 26 containers were burnt, and demanded a federal-level inquiry into the incident.
FPCCI Vice President Asif Sakhi said KICT is overloaded due to excessive cargo, making storage difficult. He said a one-week backlog persists at KICT, delaying container clearance, and demanded an investigation into how the fire started. He held the Sindh government and the mayor of Karachi responsible.
UBG Patron-in-Chief S M Tanveer urged the government to take maximum measures for the affected people. He appealed to the Chief Minister of Sindh and the Mayor of Karachi to order an inquiry into how the tragedy occurred.
He said FPCCI is working for those who became unemployed due to the incident and urged the government to make arrangements for their employment. He emphasized that those found responsible after the inquiry must be punished accordingly.

This understanding was reached in a meeting of Uzbek trade delegation with members and office bearers of APTMA, held at APTMA, Lahore on January 23, 2026. Uzbekistan delegation consisted of Zikrillayev Rukhullo, Deputy Director, and Agency for the Development of Light Industry, Bakhtiyarov Shakhzod, Chief Specialist, Najeeb Mushtaq Vohra, Honorary Consul of Uzbekistan, Ms Abdullayeva Dilorom Ubaydullaevna, Representative of CCI Uzbekistan and other prominent business leaders from Uzbekistan.
On their arrival at APTMA, they were received by Kamran Arshad, Chairman APTMA, Asad Shafi, Chairman North, Mohammad Qasim, Treasurer North, Danish Aslam, and senior executives of APTMA, leading textile manufacturers and exporters and Raza Baqir, Secretary General.
Uzbekistan delegation informed APTMA about a series of concrete steps being undertaken by the governments of Uzbekistan and Pakistan in coordination with trade associations of both the countries to upsurge bilateral trade and avail benefits from mutual potential and strengths of both the countries.
He added that this was a part of visits of Uzbek business persons to Pakistan and more delegations are expected in the coming months. He invited APTMA delegation to visit Uzbekistan and urged them to participate in the expo and exhibitions held in Uzbekistan from time to time.
Head of Uzbekistan delegation said that both Pakistan and Uzbekistan share a long history and they are brothers and not competitors or rivals. They should share their resources, knowledge and wisdom for common benefits.
He informed that Uzbekistan Trade Centers have been opened at Karachi and Lahore and urged Pakistani textile manufacturers to benefit from the services being extended by these centers.
The visiting delegation said the two countries have already signed numerous agreements for ease in flow of trade and an agreement is being signed between State Bank of Pakistan and Uzbek Bank for cooperation in banking.

Kamran highlighted incentive for setting up of industries in Pakistan. He said that Pakistan was strategically located with close proximity to all foreign markets via sea, air or land routes. He added that the goods produced in Pakistan have duty free access to European Union, China and Malaysia and preferential tariff for exports to Uzbekistan, Gulf and many other countries.

He urged for an early signing of PTA, utilization of OIC, ECO, and Shanghai Trade Cooperation platforms for expansion of bilateral trade, joint investment in the textile industry and establishment of joint ventures, frequent exchange of trade delegations, synergies in bilateral trade expansion, mutual capacity building in textile sectors, and bilateral exchange of business delegations to identify trade and investment options as a way forward to solidify trade and investment relations between Pakistan and Uzbekistan, he added.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403569,WestJet seat U-turn exposes risks for airlines squeezing economy passengers - Business Recorder,"MONTREAL: Canada’s WestJet abruptly walked back a rollout of tighter economy seating last week after viral videos showed passengers struggling with cramped legroom. The U-turn offered a sharp warning to North American airlines redesigning cabins to favor higher-paying travelers, often by trimming space and cutting once-standard perks in the back of the plane.
WestJet had reconfigured part of its Boeing 737 fleet to add premium seating and an extra six seats in economy. To make room, some economy rows were fitted with fixed-back seats that could not recline and the space between seats, known as the pitch, was reduced from 30 to 28 inches (76 to 71 cm). While the airline backed away, the episode has become a flashpoint in a broader North American push to chase higher-paying travelers and charge economy passengers extra for things that once came standard.
WestJet said its changes were aimed at giving travelers more options at different prices, but critics argued it was another step toward a thinner economy product — less comfort and more fees for basics such as choosing seats.
Independent airline industry analyst Robert Mann said WestJet’s case serves as a “cautionary tale to other carriers that there is a limit” to what economy passengers will tolerate.
Executives at Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines have told investors demand is holding up best at the front of the cabin, while demand for the cheapest tickets is more fragile as lower-income earners are pinched by rising costs since the pandemic.
At Delta, increased demand for premium cabins has more than offset softness in the main cabin. The airline said premium-cabin revenue surpassed main-cabin revenue for the first time in the fourth quarter, and expects nearly all near-term seat growth to come from premium cabins.
As airlines add extra-legroom rows, premium economy and expanded first-class cabins, the trade-offs are increasingly borne by price-sensitive travelers: less legroom, fewer inclusions, and more charges for features that used to be part of the ticket.
United has expanded its use of Basic Economy, restricting changes, advance seat selection and, on many routes, limiting travelers to a personal item unless they qualify for exemptions. American has also trimmed perks on its cheapest fares.
Even economy-focused carriers are shifting. Southwest Airlines, long known for open seating, is moving to assigned seats later this month, adding fare bundles and paid extra-legroom options.
Air passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs said travelers have learned that economy can end up costing more than the bundled fare once fees are added.
Airline executives say travelers benefit from lower base fares and that the trade-offs help airlines cover rising labor and operating costs. Data from research firm IdeaWorksCompany shows fares fell 3.8 percent in 2024 from a year earlier, while per-passenger revenue from add-on fees rose 2.5 percent.
Asked for comment, WestJet referred to a Friday statement from the carrier’s CEO, saying the airline “tried seat pitches that are popular with many airlines around the globe as they serve to provide affordable airfares.”

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402779/debt-,"Debt crisis rooted in spending, not taxation issues: Gohar - Business Recorder","ISLAMABAD: Former caretaker federal minister and Economic Policy and Business Development (EPBD) think tank Chairman Gohar Ejaz has warned that Pakistan’s deepening debt crisis is fundamentally an expenditure problem rather than a taxation failure, challenging the long-held policy narrative that low tax collection is the primary cause of fiscal stress.
Citing analysis prepared under the Economic Policy & Business Development (EPBD), Ejaz said Pakistan’s public debt trajectory over the past decade clearly shows that ballooning government spending —particularly debt servicing — has overwhelmed gains made through higher tax collection.
“Pakistan’s public debt has become a major issue over the last 10 years. The data clearly shows it is driven not by inadequate tax collection from taxpayers, but by the government’s budgetary expenditures,” Ejaz said in a post accompanied by comparative fiscal charts.

According to EPBD data, tax revenues increased by 302 percent between FY15 and FY25, rising from Rs2.91 trillion to Rs11.7 trillion, reflecting repeated tax hikes, withdrawal of exemptions, and aggressive revenue measures imposed on documented sectors.
However, during the same period, public debt surged by 365 percent, jumping from Rs17.3 trillion to Rs80.5 trillion, far outpacing revenue growth.
The figures revealed a stark fiscal paradox: for every additional rupee collected in taxes, Pakistan added Rs7.2 to its debt, with total debt rising by Rs63.2 trillion over the decade despite a Rs8.79 trillion increase in tax revenue.
Ejaz stressed that during the last three years domestic debt servicing has emerged as the single largest contributor to expenditure growth, crowding out development spending and productive investment.
“The major portion of expenditure growth in recent years is debt servicing of domestic debt, which has created a vicious cycle—borrowing to pay interest, and paying interest by borrowing more,” he noted.
Ejaz warned that continued reliance on higher taxation without expenditure discipline is eroding competitiveness, shrinking the formal economy, and discouraging investment, particularly in export-oriented industries already burdened by high energy costs and financing constraints.
“Without controlling expenditure, especially debt servicing and inefficiencies in the public sector, no amount of taxation can put Pakistan on a sustainable fiscal path,” he said.
