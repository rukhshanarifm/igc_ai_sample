https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403355/br-research-power-sectors-business-model-raises-some-questions,BR RESEARCH: Power sector’s business model raises some questions - Business Recorder,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (NEPRA) State of the Industry Report is its flagship publication. It released last Friday, covered the period between July 2024 and June 2025, and earned widespread coverage.
Within its content, one thing was clear: efforts are being made to revitalize the sector, negotiations are being re-done, contracts re-inked, and a general feel of overhaul is being instilled. But findings of the report suggest somewhat otherwise.
When you study the report, especially in the backdrop of a presentation made to the finance ministry a few days earlier, you realise one simple point: Pakistan’s power sector – despite all the efforts (talk, more than actual on-ground improvement) is still a mess. It will take years of concerted effort, policymaking, provincial coordination, protests, sacrifices, and still some more to first stop the bleeding, begin the healing before a recovery can be shown. But the energy ministry, like any company CEO, is eager to show results.
Let’s begin by examining the accounts presented to Q block, the arm of the federal government responsible for allocating finances, budgeting, and then understanding the revenue side of things. Overall, FY25’s revenues were down, and so were profits. For an ex-president of a major bank, the finance minister must have started paying closer attention. The presentation then states net losses are up 301%, a net financial deteriorating that indicates value destruction at the portfolio level.

Among the nine sectors that the government owns, power sector was the only with negative equity. It was second worst when it came to overall losses suffered (infrastructure and transport won the race). But the true highlight was the remark that it has an “unsustainable business model”.
But this isn’t the shocking bit. What’s shocking is that in the backdrop of so-called improvement in performance and the constant remarks that the sector is being overhauled and the decline has been arrested comes the revelation that power sector’s losses are up 9% during FY25.
High tariffs, reduction in circular debt, reforms etc and all the other claims still took the losses to Rs242 billion. Among the worst DISCO was QESCO, followed by PESCO, SEPCO, HESCO, LESCO, and then IESCO.
While it may be the best-performing among its universe, IESCO still incurred a loss of Rs1.4 billion, taking its accumulated losses to Rs133.7 billion. In the remarks, it says its cost base remains high. We wonder why.
When it comes to the SOI report, IESCO, which is in the top tier when it comes to controlling transmission/distribution loss and has kept its recovery nearly 435 basis points above the average recovery rate, has shown impressive results. Its financial impact, still, on the account of just these two overheads runs close to Rs10 billion combined.
Overall, the gap between the average transmission and distribution losses of all DISCOs and the allowed benchmark by NEPRA is 612 basis points. One admits that it has come down from last-year’s difference of 654 basis points, but even then, it points to one simple argument: on-ground improvements have not happened.
The government, with all its might and negotiations, still has work to do when it comes to privatising its DISCOs.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:57:00 GMT",,transmission distribution losses Pakistan,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (NEPRA) State of the Industry Report is its flagship publication.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403181/br-research-power-sector-is-only-less-bad,BR RESEARCH: Power sector is only less bad - Business Recorder,"Awais Leghari is clearly not a fan of NEPRA’s State of Industry Reports (SOIR). He slammed the 2025 edition for being published with a 5–6 month delay, claiming the lag made it “misleading” and irrelevant to the sector’s current state.
The truth tells a different story. Nepra reports have almost always followed this timeline. Given the scale and complexity of the SOIR, a January release is entirely plausible. Delays are structural, not exceptional.
At another level, the ministry’s own entities bear responsibility. Persistent failures in timely submission of generation, distribution, transmission, and collection data may well have ledinto these lags.
To call the flagship report “dated and misleading” is sour in taste. Six months do not fundamentally change sector dynamics. No ground-breaking initiatives have occurred in that period that could invalidate Nepra’s findings.
If the ministry genuinely objects to “misleading conclusions,” the solution is simple: publish monthly or quarterly sectoral data publicly. Transparent, timely disclosure would allow researchers and policymakers to assess the sector accurately, rather than relying on reactive rebuttals.
READ MORE:Power sector: Nepra sees ‘limited’ progress despite fixes
The minister takes issue with Nepra’s characterization of the Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per unit as “additional.” Technically, he is correct. The surcharge, levied to collect a small matter of Rs1800 billion to service the loans stemming from the government\s own colossal perennialinefficiency, over the next six years, is not new.
But winning the technical point misses the larger reality. This surcharge is the biggest exercise yet of penalizing the paying public for government inefficiencies. It is a tacit admission that the system cannot run without transferring the cost of loans, subsidies, and operational shortfalls directly to households.
Contrary to Leghari’s framing, the DSS did not exist forever. It was introduced at the start of FY24, and the government has now formally extended it for six more years from FY25. This is not a minor clarification. It is a direct burden on the public, effectively stamping in place a mechanism to extract billions to keep a poorly managed system afloat.
The minister went a step further by rejecting Nepra’s claim that system losses above regulatory targets impose an unnecessary burden on consumers. According to the minister, these gaps, both high losses and low recoveries, are financed by the Ministry of Finance through general revenue and therefore do not burden electricity consumers.
This argument takes the cake.
Losses above allowed limits and recoveries below targets feed directly and mechanically into the circular debt pipeline. There is no abstraction here. Every rupee lost due to inefficiency adds to the debt stock that the system cannot pay for on its own.
To argue that additions to circular debt do not burden consumers is baffling. Consumers are already paying for it. The DSS exists precisely because the bulk of circular debt flows from distribution inefficiencies and collection failures. In FY25 alone, losses and recoveries still imposed a toll of no less than Rs400 billion, the second highest annual accumulation in history despite claimed improvements.
The impact does not stop there. Transmission and distribution losses are routinely factored into quarterly tariff adjustments, which the regulator hears and approves every three months. These adjustments translate directly into higher bills. The link between losses and consumer burden is neither theoretical nor indirect. It is embedded in the tariff structure itself.
Claiming that the government absorbs the entire cost through general revenue is both incorrect and insensitive. General revenue is taxpayer money. Diverting it to cover inefficiencies in the power sector crowds out spending on health, education, and development. It does not eliminate the burden. It merely shifts and disguises it.
To trivialize this reality by suggesting that inefficiencies funded through the budget are somehow benign reflects a deeper problem. It normalizes failure. It treats the misuse of public resources as acceptable. And it ignores the fact that consumers pay for inefficiency twice, once through electricity bills and again through taxes.
Responding to assessment that rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar adoption, and that weak economic activity further suppressed demand, the minister countered by claiming the average tariff had declined from Rs53.04 per unit in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit by December 2025.
Choosing one’s own goalposts because it suits the narrative is typical of governments. Yes, tariffs have come down from their peaks. But that is like saying the scoreline improved from a 10–0 loss two years ago to a 7–0 loss this time.
The fact remains that electricity tariffs are still very high. Marginal relief does not erase cumulative damage. Nor does it restore confidence in the grid.
The shift to solar will not reverse simply because tariffs have slipped a few points. Consumers made that shift when electricity became unaffordable and unpredictable. That calculation has not changed.
If anything, the economics now tilt further away from the grid. Solar panels continue to get cheaper. Payback periods are shortening. Every incremental reduction in equipment cost reinforces the exit decision.
Against this backdrop, citing a fall in average tariffs misses the point. Behavior has already changed. The grid is competing not with past tariffs, but with falling solar costs and permanently altered consumer expectations.
Data delays do not negate dysfunction. Surcharges do not stop being burdens because they are relabeled. Losses do not disappear because they are routed through the budget. And tariffs do not become affordable because they fall from extreme to merely high.
The power sector’s problem is not perception. It is credibility. Until inefficiency is addressed at source rather than socialized through consumers and taxpayers, the exodus from the grid will continue. And no amount of arithmetic will change that.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:43:50 GMT",,transmission distribution losses Pakistan,Aais Leghari slammed the 2025 edition for being published with a 5–6 month delay.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403375/power-sector-report,EDITORIAL: Nepra’s damning report on power sector - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released a damning report on the performance of the power sector in spite of several structural and policy level interventions that included renegotiating the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) contracts signed by previous administrations (though the 2014 contracts signed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remain effective to this day) that inordinately favoured the producers with the take-or-pay option envisaging capacity payments which, in turn, escalated as and when solar panels were encouraged as part of the government’s efforts to shift towards renewables as part of reforms to withstand the climate change impacts.
In addition, Nepra noted that distribution companies continued to suffer from poor governance with transmission and distribution losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses. Reference was also made to Debt Service Surcharge sourced to poor governance of the power sub-sectors that accounts for higher utility tariffs with industry lamenting the fact that cross subsidies have made the cost of energy as an input into their production process much higher than the regional average, which is the reason behind the decline in exports. Circular debt, the report further noted, has risen.
The report undermines Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s repeated appreciation of the power sector team that perhaps prompted the Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari to publicly reject the report maintaining that it is “based on incomplete and inaccurate data which has led to widespread misunderstandings…circular debt has not increased, instead for the first time a significant reduction is recorded…it (circular debt) declined from 2.4 trillion rupees to 1.6 trillion rupees.” The government, he said, is embarked on a six-year programme to completely eliminate circular debt which includes cancellation of 8,000MW costly projects that saved the country USD 17 billion (a saving that is not realised because the project never got off the ground) and to exclude commercial losses-based load-shedding was incorrect.
It has been widely reported that the government has taken 1.25 trillion rupee loans from the commercial banking sector at rates below the amount parked in the Holding Company, given the decline in the discount rate from 22 percent in 2022 to 10.5 percent today. Borrowing at lower rates to retire previous loans incurred at higher rates is welcome though ignored is the fact that borrowing that reflects poor performance and is to be payable by the hapless consumers is hardly likely to provide a comfort level to the general public.

The Power Minister lamented the fact that Nepra did not take into account the data provided by his Ministry — a claim that is baffling given that regulatory authorities, like Nepra and Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority), are set up to protect the consumers and not to synchronise their data with that released by the political government. Additionally, regulatory bodies safeguard public welfare and ensure quality product service while preventing fraud and anti-competitive practices.
Regulatory authorities provide crucial benefits by safeguarding public welfare through consumer protection, ensuring product/service quality, promoting fair competition, preventing fraud/anti-competitive practices, and establishing clear frameworks for industries, leading to greater trust, market efficiency, innovation, and economic stability. It is therefore very concerning from a consumer perspective that the government has reportedly finalised amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 aimed at making Nepra subordinate to the Power Division — a report that has not been denied by the government to-date.
To conclude, regulatory bodies like Nepra perform a very critical function and must be allowed to continue to protect consumer interests. The incumbent government’s muzzling of several entities tasked to provide a service to the general public through legislation must be abandoned in favour of a more open and participatory discharge of functions that can lay the foundation of a system capable of evolving into one where borrowing would no longer be required.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403430/ke-dispute-gulf-investors-launch-2bn-arbitration-case-against-pakistan,KE dispute: Gulf investors launch $2bn arbitration case against Pakistan - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Saudi and Kuwaiti investors in K-Electric (KE) have accused the Power Division, including the minister concerned, as well as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), of conduct that has adversely affected their financial rights in the power utility.
These allegations form part of a USD 2 billion international arbitration initiated by Abdul Aziz Hamad A. Aljomaih, Combined National Industries Holding Company for Energy K.S.C., and others against the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
The notice of arbitration was sent by international law firms Steptoe and Omnia to the Attorney General for Pakistan, Mansoor Ali Khan, and Someir Siraj Khan, Head of the International Disputes Unit at the Office of the Attorney General for Pakistan.
Copies were also forwarded to the Prime Minister, Minister for Finance and Revenue, Minister for Energy (Power Division), Minister for Law and Justice, Federal Minister for Privatisation, Secretary of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), Governor State Bank of Pakistan, and Rizwan Pesnani, Secretary, K-Electric Limited.
According to the arbitration notice, the Claimants — Al-Jomaih and others — have not brought the arbitration lightly. They issued notices regarding breaches of domestic law at the time those breaches occurred and provided the state with every opportunity to remedy the failings. However, the notice states that the state repeatedly delayed action, reversed course without explanation, or failed to act altogether.

Most recently, the Claimants issued a Notice of Dispute under Article 17 of the OIC Investment Agreement, but despite the passage of nearly three months, the state failed or refused to participate in any form of conciliation.
As a result, Pakistan’s largest foreign private power investment has allegedly been rendered commercially unviable, amounting to a substantial deprivation of the economic use and value of the Claimants’ investments. At the same time, politically favoured actors were permitted to benefit from the state’s inaction. In these circumstances, the Claimants state they had no option but to protect their investment through arbitration.
The notice describes KE as a fully integrated Pakistani power generation and distribution company in which the Claimants have made substantial long-term investments since its privatisation in 2005. Since then, the Claimants say they have consistently worked to promote KE’s growth and commercial success, to the benefit of the company, the people of Pakistan — particularly Karachi — and KE’s other shareholders.
KE, the notice claims, was transformed from a corruption-ridden utility reliant on federal government support into a professionally managed, profitable private-sector enterprise that materially reduced system losses and reinvested earnings to strengthen and expand the business.
This transformation, the Claimants argue, was achieved through disciplined management and sustained capital commitment, including equity contributions and third-party debt financing. Together, these efforts enabled KE to invest more than USD 4.7 billion across the power value chain in Karachi’s power infrastructure between 2005 and 2025.
According to the notice, these investments delivered significant operational efficiencies and generated savings to the Respondent — the Government of Pakistan — exceeding USD 3 billion. Notably, since privatisation, the Claimants have not received any dividends, with 100 percent of profits earned since 2005 retained and reinvested in the business.
In addition to their investments in KE, the Saudi investors also hold investments in Pakistan through a financial interest in the proceeds from the sale of shares in Cnergyico, a transaction in which the sale proceeds were later misappropriated.
READ MORE:Govt devising plan to resolve KE-Nepra tariff dispute
The Saudi investors are not alone in this regard. The notice states that numerous other Middle Eastern investors also have an interest in those same proceeds and in KE, and that the state is required to safeguard those interests as well.
Further, in a letter dated November 12, 2025, the Claimants formally notified the Respondent of their intention to submit a Notice of Arbitration (NoA) in accordance with Article 17 of the OIC Investment Agreement. They stated that the Respondent’s failure to acknowledge or substantively respond to their Notice of Dispute (NoD) demonstrated the parties’ inability to agree on conciliation.
On November 13, 2025, the Respondent informed the Claimants that it was “actively taking the necessary steps and coordinating with the relevant departments, ministries, and stakeholders to obtain comprehensive instructions on the claims and allegations made in the NoD.”
The Respondent further requested the Claimants’ indulgence to provide a substantive response to the NoD and to identify “duly authorised representatives/negotiating team to engage in amicable, without prejudice settlement discussions,” indicating that this would be done by January 14, 2026.
The Claimants maintain that, acting in good faith and relying on the Respondent’s express assurances, they refrained from initiating arbitration and awaited the promised response. Despite these representations, the Respondent failed to provide any substantive response to the NoD, did not identify any duly authorised representatives, and took no discernible steps to engage in settlement discussions or conciliation, as proposed by the Claimants.
As of the date of the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent had not explain these failures. In these circumstances, the Claimants state it is evident that the Respondent is unwilling to engage meaningfully in negotiations or conciliation, rendering any further attempt at amicable resolution futile.
The Respondent, they argue, has therefore left the Claimants with no alternative but to commence arbitration proceedings to secure resolution of the dispute under the applicable treaty framework.
The Claimants own and control Al Jomaih Power Limited (AJPL) and Denham Investments Limited (Denham). Together, AJPL and Denham own 46.2 percent of KES Power Limited (Cayman Islands) (KESP). KESP, in turn, owns 66.4 percent of KE, making it the majority shareholder.
The arbitration notice further states that for more than eight years, the Respondent’s ministries and regulators failed to act in good faith in granting or processing the required approvals. Government agencies allegedly issued inconsistent instructions, imposed new and extraneous pre-conditions, and refused to issue the final no-objection certificates required for completion.
By way of example, the Government of Pakistan imposed pre-conditions for obtaining National Security Committee (NSC) clearance, including the resolution of outstanding liabilities owed by KE to Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) — a state-owned gas utility — and National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) / Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G).
While it was not required to do so, KESP assured the government that KE’s liabilities to those entities would be settled in the normal course of business and would not be affected by the proposed sale to Shanghai Electric Power (SEP).
According to the Claimants, these failures prevented completion under the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) and caused financial harm. Ultimately, SEP terminated the SPA due to the non-fulfillment of the Pakistan-specific conditions, depriving KESP of the ability to realise its investment.
Breach of the Umbrella Clause: The arbitration notice alleges a breach of the Umbrella Clause under Article 8.1 of the OIC Investment Agreement, read together with Article 11 of the Switzerland–Pakistan Bilateral Investment Treaty. Among other things, the Claimants state that the Respondent failed to comply with its obligations under the Mediation Agreement and subsequently backtracked on its express commitments that the issues raised in the 2023 Notice would be resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all parties. The Respondent’s conduct, the Claimants argue, amounted to a repudiation of those commitments.
Dispute regarding Multi-Year Tariffs (MYT): KE was previously awarded a Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) for a period of seven years, from FY 2016-17 to FY 2022-23. This MYT expired on June 30, 2023.
KE filed its petitions for generation, transmission, distribution and supply tariffs on December 1, 2022, prior to the expiry of the FY 2016-17 to FY 2022-23 MYT. However, NEPRA admitted only the generation tariff petition and returned the tariff petitions for transmission, distribution and supply, directing KE to also submit an investment plan for its transmission and distribution segments.
In compliance with NEPRA’s directions, KE submitted the requested investment plan, covering the period FY 2023-24 to FY 2029-30, on January 30, 2023.
Subsequently, on December 27, 2023, after NEPRA approved KE’s investment plan, KE filed separate tariff petitions for the transmission of electric power, distribution of electric power, and supply of electric power for an MYT covering FY 2023-24 to FY 2029-30.
NEPRA admitted the tariff petitions and published them along with a proposed list of issues. A public hearing was scheduled for June 27, 2024. No government entity, nor CPPA-G, participated in the public hearings concerning KE’s tariff petitions.
While the Respondent, through the Power Division, chose not to participate in the tariff determination hearings, it initiated parallel discussions with KE through a Power Sector Task Force, chaired by the Federal Minister for Power, Awais Leghari.
These discussions continued for nearly seven months, during which the Respondent provided assurances to KE that a sustainable MYT for the period FY 2023-24 to FY 2029-30 would be determined. On December 12, 2024, the Respondent, acting through the Power Division, submitted its comments on KE’s tariff petitions.
KE continued its engagement with the Respondent through the Power Sector Task Force and understood that all tariff-related issues had been resolved. NEPRA subsequently confirmed this understanding through its tariff determinations dated May 23 and May 27, 2025.
These determinations addressed all issues raised in the Government of Pakistan’s comments and approved KE’s tariff petitions in a manner consistent with the discussions held at the Power Sector Task Force level. NEPRA then forwarded the tariff determinations to the Respondent for notification, requesting that they be published in the Official Gazette.
However, the Power Division failed to notify the tariff determinations within the prescribed period of 30 days. Around the same time, the Minister for Power made public statements that appeared inconsistent with the spirit and substance of the consultations held with stakeholders, including the Power Division itself, despite his role as head of the Power Sector Task Force that had negotiated the tariff outcomes.
Between May and June 2025, the Claimants wrote to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), formally expressing concern over the Respondent’s refusal to notify the tariff determinations and highlighting the inconsistency between the Minister’s public remarks and the results of the regulatory consultations.
READ MORE:KE’s Alvi terms NEPRA’s revised tariff ‘unprecedented’, warns of operational strain
On July 18, 2025, after the Respondent failed to notify the tariff determinations within the mandatory period, NEPRA issued the notifications itself, as permitted under Section 31(7) of the NEPRA Act.
Following NEPRA’s notification of the tariff determinations, the Power Division opted to challenge them through review applications, including applications filed via CPPA-G, an entity wholly owned and controlled by the Respondent. CPPA-G, acting through the Power Division, also filed writ petitions before the Islamabad High Court, seeking the suspension and setting aside of NEPRA’s notifications.
NEPRA fixed the review applications for hearing and proceeded on an expedited basis. However, NEPRA failed to provide KE with copies of all review applications along with the hearing notices, thereby depriving KE of any meaningful opportunity to prepare a comprehensive defence.
This haste persisted despite serious legal defects in the review applications, including the introduction of new and substantive grounds beyond the permissible scope of review, non-payment of mandatory review fees, and the lack of locus standi on the part of certain petitioners.
These deficiencies were expressly brought to NEPRA’s attention by KE and the Claimants, through AJPL, on September 29 and October 4, 2025. KE also challenged the maintainability of the review applications during the hearings.
The demands advanced by the Respondent through the review applications, and subsequently conceded to by NEPRA in its review decision, are described in the notice as unlawful and arbitrary. These demands included, but were not limited to:(i) NEPRA initially allowed KE a USD-based Return on Equity for its distribution and transmission tariffs. The Power Division, however, demanded that the allowed Return on Equity be converted to a PKR-based return. For the generation tariff, the Power Division further proposed that, in addition to a PKR-based Return on Equity, a portion of the return be linked to plant despatch;(ii) NEPRA originally approved a distribution loss of 13.9 percent for FY 2024, together with a year-on-year improvement plan under the supply and distribution tariff. Based on the Ministry of Energy’s demands, the allowed distribution loss trajectory was revised to begin at 9 percent in FY 2024; and(iii) NEPRA originally approved a recovery trajectory under the supply tariff, improving from 93.25 percent in FY 2024 to 96.5 percent in FY 2030. The review decision removed the recovery loss allowance entirely and imposed a 100 percent recovery target, in line with the Power Division’s recommendations.
The Gulf investors argue that the Respondent’s conduct undermines regulatory independence and violates fundamental principles of procedural fairness. They contend that the conduct breaches the OIC Investment Agreement in several respects.
First, the review decisions allegedly deprive the Claimants of the economic value, viability and expected returns of their investment without compensation. Although legal title may formally remain, the cumulative impact of the review decisions is said to effectively neutralise the investment and render it economically worthless. KE has estimated that the annual financial impact of the Respondent’s MYT-related demands would be approximately Rs. 85 billion for FY 2024 alone, which, the Claimants argue, would inevitably result in the economic destruction of KE.
Second, the Claimants assert that the arbitrary reversal of settled regulatory outcomes constitutes a repudiation of their legitimate expectations arising from the MYT framework, the discussions held with the Respondent at the Power Sector Task Force level, and NEPRA’s tariff determinations. They further allege that unlawful pressure was exerted on the regulator.
According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s conduct reflects a lack of transparency, consistency and good faith, undermining the stability of Pakistan’s legal and business environment. They further argue that the conduct highlights NEPRA’s lack of independence and its failure to act in accordance with the NEPRA Act, 1997, and the relevant provisions of the NEPRA Licensing (Distribution) Regulations, 2022.
Third, the Claimants allege that the Respondent improperly interfered with an independent regulatory process, procured the initiation and expedited pursuit of legally deficient review proceedings, and frustrated the final and binding nature of NEPRA’s tariff determinations.
Taken cumulatively, the Claimants argue that these actions deprived them of a functioning, impartial and predictable legal framework for the determination and protection of their rights.
Finally, the Claimants contend that the pressure exerted on NEPRA to uphold the review applications had the purpose or effect of destroying their investment and facilitating an attempt by a domestic investor to obtain control of K-Electric.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:57:01 GMT",,transmission distribution losses Pakistan,"Allegations form part of a USD 2 billion international arbitration initiated by Abdul Aziz Hamad A.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403257/world-bank-concerned-about-nepras-independence,World Bank concerned about Nepra’s independence - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bank (WB) has reportedly raised concerns over proposed amendments to the Nepra Act, 1997, and the Electricity Act, 1910, which may compromise the independence of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), well-informed sources toldBusiness Recorder.
Under the proposed changes, the term “Federal Government” is being replaced with “Power Division” or “division concerned” for the approval of various regulatory proposals. On Sunday, in a rare development, sitting Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari publicly rebutted figures presented in Nepra’s State of Industry Report 2024–25.
“The World Bank has held one meeting with the concerned authorities and conveyed its concerns regarding the proposed replacement of the term ‘Federal Government’ with Division’. Another meeting is expected in the coming days,” the sources added.
The country’s business community and industrial sector have also expressed serious concerns over the Power Division’s move, warning that it could force the regulator to compromise its independence.
According to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also taken notice of the Power Division’s move regarding amendments to the Nepra Act.
“The prime minister has directed the Power minister to discuss the matter with him,” the sources quoted the PM Office as saying.
Section 3(a) of the Act empowers the Authority to determine tariffs, rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services by generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and to recommend these to the relevant division for notification.
Under the revised Section 31(7), notification of Nepra-approved tariffs or uniform tariffs — along with rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services—shall be made in the official Gazette by the division concerned within 30 days of intimation by the Authority.
READ MORE:Nepra approves uniform national average tariff, ignoring industry and export sector concerns
If the division fails to notify the tariff or refer the matter back to Nepra for reconsideration within the specified timeframe, the Authority may direct immediate application of its approved tariff through notification, subject to any subsequent adjustments arising from reconsideration requested by the Division.
Section 31(7)(i) provides that the division concerned may, within 30 days of receiving Nepra’s intimation regarding approved tariffs of public-sector distribution and supply licensees, require the Authority to reconsider its determination on issues common to these licensees. The Nepra would then be required to complete the reconsideration within 30 days and inform the division accordingly.
Under Section 31(7)(ii), the Nepra may make quarterly tariff adjustments within 15 days on account of capacity and transmission charges, transmission and distribution losses, variable operation and maintenance costs, and policy guidelines issued by the division concerned.
The adjusted tariff would be intimated to the division prior to Gazette notification. The division may seek reconsideration within 15 days, failing which Nepra shall notify the adjusted tariff in the official Gazette. If reconsideration is sought, the Nepra must decide the matter within 15 days and intimate the division before notification.
Section 31(7)(iii) allows the division concerned, in lieu of seeking reconsideration, to file an appeal. However, once a reconsideration request is filed, the Power Division will not be entitled to subsequently appeal the decision on that reconsideration. No changes have been proposed to Section 31(7)(iv).
Similarly, amendments have been proposed to the Electricity Act, 1910, replacing the term “Federal Government” with “appropriate authority” or “division concerned.”
Under the revised Section 32(2), any dispute between an operator and the telegraph authority regarding the placement or operation of electric supply lines shall be referred to the division concerned, which may direct the operator to make necessary alterations to comply with the law. Amendments to Section 53(1)(a) relate to the service of notices, orders, or documents, stipulating that where the addressee is the Federal or Provincial Government, such service shall be made at the office designated by the division concerned.
Business Recordersent few questions to Power Division. Questions and their response are as follows
The primary purpose of the proposed amendments is to remove procedural difficulties and avoid unnecessary administrative delays. Following the Mustafa Impex judgment, the Federal Cabinet directed all ministries to review existing laws, rules, and regulations to ensure that routine and technical matters are not escalated to the Cabinet where such escalation is not required. Accordingly, the amendments mainly replace the term “Federal Government” with “concerned Division” in limited procedural contexts to streamline filings, notifications, and technical reviews, without altering the substantive regulatory framework.
No. This understanding is incorrect. The amendments do not make Nepra subordinate to the Power Division in any manner. The Nepra remains an independent statutory regulator, administratively reporting to the Federal Cabinet. No changes have been proposed that require amendments to the Rules of Business or that alter Nepra’s legal status, independence, or quasi-judicial authority. The amendments are strictly administrative and do not interfere with Nepra’s core regulatory mandate.
No. Wherever policy decisions or policy directions are involved, the term “Federal Government” has been consciously retained in the law. At no place do the proposed amendments authorise the Power Division to issue policy directions independently or bypass the Federal Cabinet. The scope of the changes is limited to procedural and technical matters only.
The Federal Cabinet has approved the draft set of proposed amendments. Following this, the draft legislation will undergo due legal vetting and finalisation. Once completed, the bill will be submitted to Parliament through the Parliamentary Affairs Division, in accordance with the prescribed legislative process.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403376/opinion-from-solar-subsidy-to-system-stress-rethinking-net-metering-in-pakistan,OPINION: From solar subsidy to system stress: rethinking net metering in Pakistan - Business Recorder,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra’s) latest revision in net metering scheme stirred an expected backlash. Much of the debate focused on lower buyback rates and potential discouragement of rooftop solar adoption. Yet this framing obscures the deeper policy logic.
The net-metering adjustment is more about addressing three structural distortions that are embedded into Pakistan’s power market than about discouraging solar power: regressive cost shifting, incompatibility with a capacity-payment dominated system, and unchecked solar expansion lacking grid flexibility.
Under the Alternative & Renewable Energy Distributed Generation and Net Metering Regulations, 2015, solar prosumers were allowed to offset electricity imports with exports at the retail tariff. This retail rate is not, however, a marginal energy price. It embeds a large share of fixed costs: capacity payments, network charges, legacy inefficiencies, and cross-subsidies for protected consumers.
READ MORE:Pakistan’s net metering generation surges over 100% in Sept 2025
As the adoption of rooftop solar grew, mainly by upper-income urban households and commercial consumers, they increasingly escaped paying fixed system costs. As a result, the burden was imposed on the rest of the grid-dependent consumers, many of whom are not in the protected lifeline brackets, but lack the capital to invest in solar.
The NEPRA’s State of the Industry Reports regularly record the increasing regressivity of surcharges and cross-subsidies in the tariff structure of the country. In this context, net metering functioned as a shadow subsidy, which bypassed the scrutiny of the parliament and redistributed system costs from top to bottom.
The revised policy implicitly reaffirms the cost causality principle, which is a statutory obligation under the Nepra Act, and not a matter of policy consideration.
The more fundamental tension lies in Pakistan’s generation contracting structure. The power sector has evolved over the past ten years toward a regime largely dominated by long-term take-or-pay contracts. Capacity payments have become a significant and rigid part of the total system cost irrespective of the level of electricity consumption.
Net metering enabled an increasing percentage of consumers to draw down grid offtake during daylight hours without reducing the system’s fixed costs.
Capacity costs were being recovered on an increasing per unit basis as sales volume fell. Higher tariffs in turn enhanced the economic incentive for additional consumers to install rooftop solar not as a productivity-enhancing investment, but as a defensive response to tariff escalation.
This mechanism generated a self-reinforcing loop: higher tariffs contributed to more grid defection, which further squeezed the sales base over which fixed costs were recovered.
WATCH: Will Pakistan abolish net metering?
Importantly, instead of relaxing circular debt tensions, it heightened them. In this respect Nepra’s policy shift should be seen as a reaction to stop the unsustainable erosion of the tariff base, and not as a pullback from the renewable energy targets.
The third aspect which is often ignored is more on the technical side. Pakistan’s net-metering policy was designed for rapid growth of solar with zero structure towards system integration. Rooftop solar exports peaks in the midday, when demand is weak, but no incentives have ever been offered to prosumers to get batteries or smart inverters.
The new net-metering regime, while harsh, throws an implicit hint at an emerging solar market orientated towards self-consumption, where solar value lies in matching generation with load, rather than sending excess out the grid at fixed prices.
But without a package of complementary measures, including time-of-use tariffs, incentives for storage, and mechanisms for flexibility at the distribution level, the reform may be perceived as punitive rather than corrective. Although the adjustment made by Nepra does cater to some of the distortions, the real problem is not net metering, rather it is the absence of a suitable distributed energy policy in line with the market design.
Capacity charges continue to be volumetric rather than fixed. Although solar remains an important component of energy security for Pakistan, reforming net-metering only, in the absence of addressing these macro-structural issues, would not lead to just energy transitions.
Incentives for green energy transition cannot be simply added on top of a fundamentally distorted structure of the market without creating further inequalities and inefficiencies.
So the real issue is not about the rising tariffs but whether Pakistan is prepared to restructure its power system so distributed solar flourishes with the grid rather than at the grid’s expense.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403375,EDITORIAL: Nepra’s damning report on power sector - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released a damning report on the performance of the power sector in spite of several structural and policy level interventions that included renegotiating the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) contracts signed by previous administrations (though the 2014 contracts signed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remain effective to this day) that inordinately favoured the producers with the take-or-pay option envisaging capacity payments which, in turn, escalated as and when solar panels were encouraged as part of the government’s efforts to shift towards renewables as part of reforms to withstand the climate change impacts.
In addition, Nepra noted that distribution companies continued to suffer from poor governance with transmission and distribution losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses. Reference was also made to Debt Service Surcharge sourced to poor governance of the power sub-sectors that accounts for higher utility tariffs with industry lamenting the fact that cross subsidies have made the cost of energy as an input into their production process much higher than the regional average, which is the reason behind the decline in exports. Circular debt, the report further noted, has risen.
The report undermines Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s repeated appreciation of the power sector team that perhaps prompted the Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari to publicly reject the report maintaining that it is “based on incomplete and inaccurate data which has led to widespread misunderstandings…circular debt has not increased, instead for the first time a significant reduction is recorded…it (circular debt) declined from 2.4 trillion rupees to 1.6 trillion rupees.” The government, he said, is embarked on a six-year programme to completely eliminate circular debt which includes cancellation of 8,000MW costly projects that saved the country USD 17 billion (a saving that is not realised because the project never got off the ground) and to exclude commercial losses-based load-shedding was incorrect.
It has been widely reported that the government has taken 1.25 trillion rupee loans from the commercial banking sector at rates below the amount parked in the Holding Company, given the decline in the discount rate from 22 percent in 2022 to 10.5 percent today. Borrowing at lower rates to retire previous loans incurred at higher rates is welcome though ignored is the fact that borrowing that reflects poor performance and is to be payable by the hapless consumers is hardly likely to provide a comfort level to the general public.

The Power Minister lamented the fact that Nepra did not take into account the data provided by his Ministry — a claim that is baffling given that regulatory authorities, like Nepra and Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority), are set up to protect the consumers and not to synchronise their data with that released by the political government. Additionally, regulatory bodies safeguard public welfare and ensure quality product service while preventing fraud and anti-competitive practices.
Regulatory authorities provide crucial benefits by safeguarding public welfare through consumer protection, ensuring product/service quality, promoting fair competition, preventing fraud/anti-competitive practices, and establishing clear frameworks for industries, leading to greater trust, market efficiency, innovation, and economic stability. It is therefore very concerning from a consumer perspective that the government has reportedly finalised amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 aimed at making Nepra subordinate to the Power Division — a report that has not been denied by the government to-date.
To conclude, regulatory bodies like Nepra perform a very critical function and must be allowed to continue to protect consumer interests. The incumbent government’s muzzling of several entities tasked to provide a service to the general public through legislation must be abandoned in favour of a more open and participatory discharge of functions that can lay the foundation of a system capable of evolving into one where borrowing would no longer be required.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402591/weak-disco-performance-added-rs397bn-to-circular-debt-in-fy25-nepra-report,Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report - Business Recorder,"Weak performance by Pakistan’s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country’s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.
The report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with “rigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)” to reduce tariffs were a milestone.
However, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.
“Overall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,” the report read.

The regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the “old era of scarcity is ending”, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might “prove to be even more complex”.
Operational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.
In its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.
Meanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the ‘Take or Pay’ electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.
NEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.
“A significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan’s power system.”
The regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.
“It remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.”
On the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.

At the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.
“Governance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan’s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,” the NEPRA report said.
KE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.
In contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.
QESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.

Within its content, one thing was clear: efforts are being made to revitalize the sector, negotiations are being re-done, contracts re-inked, and a general feel of overhaul is being instilled. But findings of the report suggest somewhat otherwise.
When you study the report, especially in the backdrop of a presentation made to the finance ministry a few days earlier, you realise one simple point: Pakistan’s power sector – despite all the efforts (talk, more than actual on-ground improvement) is still a mess. It will take years of concerted effort, policymaking, provincial coordination, protests, sacrifices, and still some more to first stop the bleeding, begin the healing before a recovery can be shown. But the energy ministry, like any company CEO, is eager to show results.
Let’s begin by examining the accounts presented to Q block, the arm of the federal government responsible for allocating finances, budgeting, and then understanding the revenue side of things. Overall, FY25’s revenues were down, and so were profits. For an ex-president of a major bank, the finance minister must have started paying closer attention. The presentation then states net losses are up 301%, a net financial deteriorating that indicates value destruction at the portfolio level.

Among the nine sectors that the government owns, power sector was the only with negative equity. It was second worst when it came to overall losses suffered (infrastructure and transport won the race). But the true highlight was the remark that it has an “unsustainable business model”.
But this isn’t the shocking bit. What’s shocking is that in the backdrop of so-called improvement in performance and the constant remarks that the sector is being overhauled and the decline has been arrested comes the revelation that power sector’s losses are up 9% during FY25.
High tariffs, reduction in circular debt, reforms etc and all the other claims still took the losses to Rs242 billion. Among the worst DISCO was QESCO, followed by PESCO, SEPCO, HESCO, LESCO, and then IESCO.
While it may be the best-performing among its universe, IESCO still incurred a loss of Rs1.4 billion, taking its accumulated losses to Rs133.7 billion. In the remarks, it says its cost base remains high. We wonder why.
When it comes to the SOI report, IESCO, which is in the top tier when it comes to controlling transmission/distribution loss and has kept its recovery nearly 435 basis points above the average recovery rate, has shown impressive results. Its financial impact, still, on the account of just these two overheads runs close to Rs10 billion combined.
Overall, the gap between the average transmission and distribution losses of all DISCOs and the allowed benchmark by NEPRA is 612 basis points.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403565/data-breaches-highlight-cyber-security-gaps,Data breaches highlight cyber security gaps - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: The latest hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior shone a sharp spotlight on the alarming state of cyber security across key state institutions, including NADRA and the FBR, whose repeated breaches have resulted in the leakage of citizens’ sensitive personal data.
Senator Afnanullah Khan was particularly forthright in pointing out systemic failures in data protection, warning that the scale and frequency of data theft from official databases could indicate possible official connivance.
At the same time, this pattern also signals deep structural weaknesses in the country’s cyber security architecture. As the senator noted, consolidated datasets sourced from NADRA, the FBR and even the banking system are available on the dark web, underscoring the gravity of the threat and the inadequacy of existing cyber security systems.
Troublingly, this fragility extends beyond the public sector. Private companies, including banks, telecom operators and digital platforms, among others, remain exposed to leaks, hacks and organised cybercrime, often operating with outdated security protocols and weak incident-response mechanisms.
Attackers, meanwhile, have grown increasingly sophisticated, deploying automated tools, social engineering and cross-database correlation to monetise stolen data at scale. Clearly, cyber security is still not treated as a core governance and business risk that is backed by sustained investment, enforcement and accountability, rendering both the state and the market vulnerable in an increasingly hostile digital environment.
READ MORE:Citizens’ personal data on dark web: NADRA asked to further strengthen cybersecurity measures
Recent years have seen the government aggressively push a digitalisation agenda. The Digital Nation Pakistan Act passed last year, for instance, aims to build a robust digital society, economy and governance system, envisaging increased digitalisation of government departments and provision of digital identities for all citizens. What has received far less attention is that pursuing such a far-reaching agenda is not without serious risks.
Rapid digital expansion sans critical safeguards, creates large centralised data repositories, opens up more points of attack and increases the damage when systems are compromised. Any drive towards digitalisation, whether in the public or private sector, must therefore be matched by the institution of robust, continuously evolving safety protocols and protection mechanisms.
It is, then, shocking that Pakistan still lacks a comprehensive data protection legislation that safeguards citizens’ personal and financial information, and mandates systematic investments in cyber security infrastructure, including frameworks to combat hacking, digital crimes, identity theft and financial fraud. Recent government actions in the digital realm, in fact, have exacerbated existing weaknesses in the country’s cyber security infrastructure.
Measures such as throttling internet speeds and attempting to restrict VPN usage reveal a limited understanding of the broader implications of these actions. Slower internet, for instance, impedes critical communication channels, delaying security updates and creating vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit.
Restricting VPNs, meanwhile, undermines essential tools for online privacy and the protection of sensitive data, weakening the security of both public and private systems across the economy. On top of that, institutions like the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency appear to prioritise citizen surveillance and clampdown on dissent over building genuine cyber resilience, a disconnect reflected in persistently low conviction rates in cybercrime cases.
What is urgently needed, therefore, is firstly a recalibration of government priorities, placing cyber security above citizen surveillance in its digital agenda. Equally critical is a comprehensive data protection legislation that mandates all entities moving to digital platforms to maintain the requisite infrastructure and expertise essential to secure their systems against evolving cyber threats.
Ongoing upgrades to security protocols and digital capacities must be a statutory requirement to stay ahead of emerging risks. Importantly, an independent regulatory body, manned by data security experts rather than career bureaucrats, must oversee the enforcement of such a law. The government must realise that without a dedicated regulatory framework, the risks associated with digital expansion could actually end up undermining its benefits.

According to data gathered by Business Recorder armed robbers stole or snatched 30 motorcycle thefts, three car, eight robberies, and 14 street crime incidents involving the snatching of cash and mobile phones. The incidents were reported at various police stations across the city.
During the period under review, criminal activity remained particularly high within the jurisdictions of Industrial Area, Aabpara, Karachi Company, Shalimar, Tarnol and Koral police stations. One of the most shocking incidents of the week was reported to Industrial Area, where a senior lawyer namely Sheikh Abdul Rauf was shot dead. The dead body of the deceased lawyer was spotted by a passerby in sector H-9 Islamabad. Police upon getting information rushed to the spot and shifted the body to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) for legal formalities. A bullet wound was found at the backside of the body police said.
Police later claimed the arrest of a person who allegedly killed the lawyer; produced the accused Wajid Khan as suspect involved in the murder of lawyer Sheikh Rauf in Islamabad; has been arrested by police.
Islamabad Police produced the accused before Judicial Magistrate Mian Azhar Nadeem under strict security for obtaining his physical remand.
According to police, the accused, Wajid Khan, belongs to Malakand Agency and was arrested a day ago. During the hearing, police argued that police required the remand to recover the vehicle used in the crime and to conduct further investigation from the accused.
Accepting the police plea, the court granted a five-day physical remand of the accused.

According to OGDCL, the latest receipt brings the total interest recovered so far to approximately Rs54 billion.
The interest repayments follow a major settlement reached in June 2024, when the federal government cleared Rs82 billion in principal dues owed to the company as part of broader efforts to reduce circular debt in the energy sector.
Circular debt has long strained Pakistan’s power and energy supply chain, where delayed payments by power producers trigger liquidity shortfalls for fuel suppliers and upstream exploration companies.
OGDCL stated that the continued flow of payments has strengthened its cash position, supporting ongoing exploration and production activities across the country.
Market participants have responded with cautious optimism, viewing the government’s adherence to the repayment schedule as a positive signal of fiscal discipline. Analysts note that sustained progress under the settlement plan could ease financial pressures in the energy sector and help reduce Pakistan’s reliance on imported fuel over the long term.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403029,Circular debt brought down: NA told - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly was informed on Monday that the total circular debt, which stood at Rs2,794 billion in March 2024, was brought down to Rs1,614 billion in June 2025 – marking an improvement of Rs780 billion within just one year.
In response to questions raised by lawmakers, Minister for Power Awais Leghari outlined a series of measures designed to curb the accumulation of circular debt.
He explained that the measures included negotiations with power producers to waive Rs260 billion in late payment interest charges, along with efforts to reduce inefficiencies within Distribution Companies (Discos), which led to an improvement of Rs193 billion. As a result, the debt in Discos decreased from Rs590 billion in 2024 to Rs397 billion in 2025, he added.
He also highlighted improvements in macroeconomic indicators – such as a stable exchange rate, lower KIBOR, and reduced inflation – as factors that contributed to lower tariffs and reduced markup charges on payables. These, in turn, played a key role in reducing the circular debt, he added. The minister also confirmed that K-Electric had resumed regular payments as part of the debt reduction plan.
He stated that the government has set a target to eliminate circular debt within the next six years, supported by parallel reforms aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the power sector. “This initiative is expected to lead to the removal of the Debt Servicing Surcharge, which currently stands at Rs3.23 per unit and is levied to cover the markup on circular debt payables,” he added.
Additionally, he mentioned that the government plans to reconstitute the boards of Discos to further address inefficiencies within distribution companies.
Moreover, he stated that the government has begun transitioning to a more competitive electricity market, moving away from the long-standing single-buyer model, where the state was the sole purchaser of electricity.
The new structure will operate through competitive bidding and market-based pricing under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contractual Market (CTBCM) framework, he added.
During the question hour, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik assured the House that the domestic gas sector is receiving uninterrupted supply at optimal pressure, especially during peak cooking hours.
He added that Sui companies are ensuring daily gas availability from 5 am to 10 pm. Malik also informed the House that the addition of 12 LNG cargoes to the supply network had improved the availability of regasified LNG (RLNG), helping meet demand across all sectors. Additionally, a dedicated dashboard has been set up to address consumer complaints on a daily basis.
Parliamentary Secretary for Communications, Gul Asghar Khan, confirmed that all infrastructure projects carried out by the National Highway Authority (NHA) adhere to international standards.
Khan explained that the design of highways includes a 10-year lifespan for pavements and 50 years for bridges and tunnels. He also stated that the feasibility study for the M-10 Motorway is near completion and that the project will be executed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model.

The dispute surfaced following a meeting held on December 30, 2025, in Islamabad to discuss gas allocation and the Gas Sale Purchase Agreements (GSPAs) of Guddu Power Plant (GPP) and Nandipur Power Plant.
PSO officials participated remotely and were advised to formally communicate the receivable position of GENCO-III/NPP as of January 1, 2025.
READ MORE:Senate panel told: Guddu and Nandipur power plants ready for sell-off
According to PSO, its principal receivables from GENCO-III amount to Rs65.3 billion, of which Rs61.1 billion pertains to Nandipur Power Plant. The total outstanding against GENCO-III stands at Rs159.2 billion, including Rs93.9 billion in late payment surcharge (LPS).
PSO stated that it approached CPPA-G for the release of payments but was informed that CPPA-G had no liability toward GENCO-III or NPP, claiming all dues had already been cleared. PSO maintains that during a meeting, held in October 2019 at the GENCO-III office in Muzaffargarh, it was informed that CPPA-G had paid approximately Rs61 billion meant for PSO.
PSO alleges that GENCO-III instead used Rs32 billion of the amount for capital investment in Nandipur Power Plant, while the remaining Rs29 billion was utilized to cover operational losses during the plant’s initial period. PSO further stated that its receivables include Rs3.8 billion related to furnace oil supplies made to NPP in July 2016, comprising Rs87 million in principal and Rs3.8 billion in LPS.
Despite repeated follow-ups, PSO claims no progress has been made and requested the Power Minister to direct the concerned authorities to expedite the release of payments, particularly ahead of the proposed privatisation of Nandipur Power Plant.
Meanwhile, the Petroleum Division approached Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over non-payment of more than Rs409 billion owed to PSO, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) by public sector power generation companies (GENCOs).
The issue was also discussed in a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on December 9, 2025, where it was noted that GENCO-II and GENCO-III together owe Rs409.26 billion to fuel suppliers.
In a letter, the Minister for Petroleum recalled that the Minister for Power had assured the ECC of making personal efforts to resolve the issue and requested a clear settlement plan, along with a consultation meeting between the Additional Secretaries of both divisions to finalize a roadmap for prompt payment.
According to sources, PPL’s outstanding receivables from GENCO-II stand at Rs146.15 billion (principal Rs77.63 billion and LPS Rs 68.52 billion). Mari Petroleum is owed Rs34 billion in principal and Rs49 billion in LPS, while SNGPL’s receivables include Rs8.9 billion in principal and Rs21.21 billion in LPS.
PSO’s total receivables from GENCO-III amount to Rs150 billion, including Rs68 billion in principal and Rs82 billion in LPS. Overall, principal receivables against GENCO-II stand at Rs120.53 billion with LPS of Rs138.73 billion, while GENCO-III’s principal liabilities total Rs68 billion with LPS of Rs82 billion.
Earlier, on August 5, 2025, the Petroleum Minister had also written to the Power Minister, reminding him that the issue of outstanding receivables from GENCO-II and GENCO-III was raised during the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) meeting held on July 29, 2025, but was not addressed in discussions on power sector circular debt settlement.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403376/from-solar-subsidy-to-system-stress-rethinking-net-metering-in-pakistan,From solar subsidy to system stress: rethinking net metering in Pakistan - Business Recorder,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra’s) latest revision in net metering scheme stirred an expected backlash. Much of the debate focused on lower buyback rates and potential discouragement of rooftop solar adoption. Yet this framing obscures the deeper policy logic.
The net-metering adjustment is more about addressing three structural distortions that are embedded into Pakistan’s power market than about discouraging solar power: regressive cost shifting, incompatibility with a capacity-payment dominated system, and unchecked solar expansion lacking grid flexibility.
Under the Alternative & Renewable Energy Distributed Generation and Net Metering Regulations, 2015, solar prosumers were allowed to offset electricity imports with exports at the retail tariff. This retail rate is not, however, a marginal energy price. It embeds a large share of fixed costs: capacity payments, network charges, legacy inefficiencies, and cross-subsidies for protected consumers.
READ MORE:Pakistan’s net metering generation surges over 100% in Sept 2025
As the adoption of rooftop solar grew, mainly by upper-income urban households and commercial consumers, they increasingly escaped paying fixed system costs. As a result, the burden was imposed on the rest of the grid-dependent consumers, many of whom are not in the protected lifeline brackets, but lack the capital to invest in solar.
The NEPRA’s State of the Industry Reports regularly record the increasing regressivity of surcharges and cross-subsidies in the tariff structure of the country. In this context, net metering functioned as a shadow subsidy, which bypassed the scrutiny of the parliament and redistributed system costs from top to bottom.
The revised policy implicitly reaffirms the cost causality principle, which is a statutory obligation under the Nepra Act, and not a matter of policy consideration.
The more fundamental tension lies in Pakistan’s generation contracting structure. The power sector has evolved over the past ten years toward a regime largely dominated by long-term take-or-pay contracts. Capacity payments have become a significant and rigid part of the total system cost irrespective of the level of electricity consumption.
Net metering enabled an increasing percentage of consumers to draw down grid offtake during daylight hours without reducing the system’s fixed costs.
Capacity costs were being recovered on an increasing per unit basis as sales volume fell. Higher tariffs in turn enhanced the economic incentive for additional consumers to install rooftop solar not as a productivity-enhancing investment, but as a defensive response to tariff escalation.
This mechanism generated a self-reinforcing loop: higher tariffs contributed to more grid defection, which further squeezed the sales base over which fixed costs were recovered.
WATCH: Will Pakistan abolish net metering?
Importantly, instead of relaxing circular debt tensions, it heightened them. In this respect Nepra’s policy shift should be seen as a reaction to stop the unsustainable erosion of the tariff base, and not as a pullback from the renewable energy targets.
The third aspect which is often ignored is more on the technical side. Pakistan’s net-metering policy was designed for rapid growth of solar with zero structure towards system integration. Rooftop solar exports peaks in the midday, when demand is weak, but no incentives have ever been offered to prosumers to get batteries or smart inverters.
The new net-metering regime, while harsh, throws an implicit hint at an emerging solar market orientated towards self-consumption, where solar value lies in matching generation with load, rather than sending excess out the grid at fixed prices.
But without a package of complementary measures, including time-of-use tariffs, incentives for storage, and mechanisms for flexibility at the distribution level, the reform may be perceived as punitive rather than corrective. Although the adjustment made by Nepra does cater to some of the distortions, the real problem is not net metering, rather it is the absence of a suitable distributed energy policy in line with the market design.
Capacity charges continue to be volumetric rather than fixed. Although solar remains an important component of energy security for Pakistan, reforming net-metering only, in the absence of addressing these macro-structural issues, would not lead to just energy transitions.
Incentives for green energy transition cannot be simply added on top of a fundamentally distorted structure of the market without creating further inequalities and inefficiencies.
So the real issue is not about the rising tariffs but whether Pakistan is prepared to restructure its power system so distributed solar flourishes with the grid rather than at the grid’s expense.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403375/editorial-nepras-damning-report-on-power-sector,EDITORIAL: Nepra’s damning report on power sector - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released a damning report on the performance of the power sector in spite of several structural and policy level interventions that included renegotiating the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) contracts signed by previous administrations (though the 2014 contracts signed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remain effective to this day) that inordinately favoured the producers with the take-or-pay option envisaging capacity payments which, in turn, escalated as and when solar panels were encouraged as part of the government’s efforts to shift towards renewables as part of reforms to withstand the climate change impacts.
In addition, Nepra noted that distribution companies continued to suffer from poor governance with transmission and distribution losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses. Reference was also made to Debt Service Surcharge sourced to poor governance of the power sub-sectors that accounts for higher utility tariffs with industry lamenting the fact that cross subsidies have made the cost of energy as an input into their production process much higher than the regional average, which is the reason behind the decline in exports. Circular debt, the report further noted, has risen.
The report undermines Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s repeated appreciation of the power sector team that perhaps prompted the Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari to publicly reject the report maintaining that it is “based on incomplete and inaccurate data which has led to widespread misunderstandings…circular debt has not increased, instead for the first time a significant reduction is recorded…it (circular debt) declined from 2.4 trillion rupees to 1.6 trillion rupees.” The government, he said, is embarked on a six-year programme to completely eliminate circular debt which includes cancellation of 8,000MW costly projects that saved the country USD 17 billion (a saving that is not realised because the project never got off the ground) and to exclude commercial losses-based load-shedding was incorrect.
It has been widely reported that the government has taken 1.25 trillion rupee loans from the commercial banking sector at rates below the amount parked in the Holding Company, given the decline in the discount rate from 22 percent in 2022 to 10.5 percent today. Borrowing at lower rates to retire previous loans incurred at higher rates is welcome though ignored is the fact that borrowing that reflects poor performance and is to be payable by the hapless consumers is hardly likely to provide a comfort level to the general public.

The Power Minister lamented the fact that Nepra did not take into account the data provided by his Ministry — a claim that is baffling given that regulatory authorities, like Nepra and Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority), are set up to protect the consumers and not to synchronise their data with that released by the political government. Additionally, regulatory bodies safeguard public welfare and ensure quality product service while preventing fraud and anti-competitive practices.
Regulatory authorities provide crucial benefits by safeguarding public welfare through consumer protection, ensuring product/service quality, promoting fair competition, preventing fraud/anti-competitive practices, and establishing clear frameworks for industries, leading to greater trust, market efficiency, innovation, and economic stability. It is therefore very concerning from a consumer perspective that the government has reportedly finalised amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 aimed at making Nepra subordinate to the Power Division — a report that has not been denied by the government to-date.
To conclude, regulatory bodies like Nepra perform a very critical function and must be allowed to continue to protect consumer interests. The incumbent government’s muzzling of several entities tasked to provide a service to the general public through legislation must be abandoned in favour of a more open and participatory discharge of functions that can lay the foundation of a system capable of evolving into one where borrowing would no longer be required.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403753,Plunge in FDI - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: Foreign direct investment (FDI) has plunged by 43 percent July-December 2025 as per data released by the State Bank of Pakistan.
This is a further decline from data released by the Finance Division in its monthly report titled Economic Update and Outlook for December FDI was reported at USD 927.4 million (July-November) 2025 against USD 1,242.4 million in the comparable period of the year before — a decline of 34 percent.
Portfolio investment registered negative USD 613.8 million July-November 2025 against USD 148.7 million in the same period of 2024, thereby raising serious questions as to what are the major lacunas in FDI and portfolio investment inflows, especially, given that over USD 25 billion Memoranda of Understanding have been signed between Pakistan and other countries during the past two to three years? An oft-cited reason is the lack of environment that is conducive to foreign inflows — with Pakistan’s trade deficit once again beginning to bludgeon, reflecting the inability of the reforms to break the boom-bust cycle, the foreign exchange reserves are largely if not wholly debt-based and the rupee-dollar parity remains under control due to what is perceived not as market forces.
A news item carried in a section of press may provide another equally if not more cogent reason for not only very low FDI inflows into the country compared to our regional competitors — particularly China and India — but also the decline in the FDI in recent months.

Thirty-two Saudi individuals and entities and five Kuwaiti investors in K-Electric have launched a USD 2 billion international arbitration case against Pakistan on 16 January 2026 after failure to resolve a dispute over regulatory intervention, unpaid government dues and a decades-long dispute over the USD 1.77 billion sale of the only private power company in the country.
Lessons must be drawn from the serious flaws in the privatisation of K-Electric under the advice of multilaterals that range from insistence to equalise tariffs countrywide through subsidies (K-Electric has been budgeted a subsidy of 125 billion rupees this year) which defeats the very purpose of privatisation, as well as the option of purchasing electricity from the national grid (which makes economic sense today though not earlier as capacity payments have risen markedly due to the ill-advised incentives given for solarisation).
In addition, the litigants have accused the government of undermining the independence of the regulator, Nepra, by not notifying its tariff determination in May 2025 — a charge strengthened by reports that the Power Division is seeking amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 and Electricity Act 1910 to make the regulator subordinate to its dictates though reports suggest that the Prime Minister has taken strong exception to this proposal. These concerns were voiced to the Prime Minister during his trips to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and while he did pledge to resolve these issues they remained unresolved.
While administration after administration rhetorically seeks FDI yet instances where the foreign investor(s) has to resort to international arbitration abound — a major deterrent to any future investors and in a majority of cases Pakistan lost and had to pay millions of dollars of penalties.
One can only hope that the government in general and the Special Investment Facilitation Council in particular take cognizance of failure to respond in a timely manner to existing foreign investor concerns and begins to hold those involved responsible instead of quietly paying the penalty out of our extremely scarce foreign exchange reserves.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403328,Fitch Ratings affirms Pakistan’s long-term debt ratings at B- - Business Recorder,"Fitch Ratings affirmed Pakistan’s long-term debt ratings at B- and assigned a Recovery Rating of RR4 following the removal of the ratings from Under Criteria Observation (UCO), according to an official release on Wednesday.
The rating actions reflect the application of Fitch’s new Sovereign Rating Criteria, effective September 2025, and the inclusion of recovery assumptions into sovereign debt ratings for the first time.
Fitch’s credit rating scale for issuers and issues is expressed using the categories ‘AAA’ to ‘BBB’ (investment grade) and ‘BB’ to ‘D’ (speculative grade) with an additional +/- for AA through CCC levels indicating relative differences of probability of default or recovery for issues.
The terms “investment grade” and “speculative grade” are market conventions and do not imply any recommendation or endorsement of a specific security for investment purposes. Investment grade categories indicate relatively low to moderate credit risk, while ratings in the speculative categories signal either a higher level of credit risk or that a default has already occurred.

Key rating drivers
The senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Pakistan and The Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Company Limited are equalised with Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), reflecting “Fitch’s expectation of average recovery prospects in a default scenario, given Pakistan’s high levels of general government debt and interest payments as a percentage of revenue, and the absence of any other clearly identifiable criteria factors that would cause us to notch the debt ratings up or down from the IDR”.
On April 15, 2025,Fitch upgradedPakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR to B- with a stable outlook, from CCC+.
Pakistan has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for political stability and rights and for the rule of law, institutional and regulatory quality and control of corruption, as is the case for all sovereigns.
“These scores reflect the high weight that World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model. Pakistan has a WBGI ranking at the 22nd percentile,” Fitch said.
Rating sensitivities
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade include failure to keep government debt and debt-servicing metrics on a firm downward path, and renewed deterioration in external liquidity conditions, for example from delays in International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme reviews or insufficiently tight economic policy settings.
Meanwhile, factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade include significant declines in government debt and debt-servicing burdens, for example due to the implementation of fiscal consolidation plans in line with IMF programme commitments, leading to structural improvements in tax revenue generation.
Further significant easing of external financing risks, including evidence of greater ability to source external funding and a sustained recovery in foreign-currency reserves beyond Fitch’s forecasts could also lead to a positive rating action.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:58:31 GMT",,capacity payments,"Fitch Ratings affirmed Pakistan’s long-term debt ratings at B- and assigned a Recovery Rating of RR4 following the removal of the ratings from Under Criteria Observation (UCO Pakistan has a WBGI ranking at the 22nd percentile,’ Fitch said. “These scores reflect the high weight that World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in",2.243835926055908,True,0.13518966734409332,power sector reform
https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403568/opinion-stablecoin-amp-tokenisation,OPINION: Stablecoin & tokenisation - Business Recorder,"The global monetary system is entering a new phase in which digital money is no longer an experiment but an emerging infrastructure of statecraft, finance, and trade. Emerging economies are fast shaping this transition rather than merely observing from sidelines.
Pakistan’s recent moves toward a dollar-backed stablecoin and the tokenisation of up to US$2 billion in sovereign assets place it at a decisive inflection point in this transformation. These decisions would determine whether Pakistan becomes a pioneer in regulated digital finance or turn out to be a cautionary case of premature technological adoption without institutional depth.
The main question is not whether Pakistan can deploy blockchain technology, but whether it can build a coherent, credible, and resilient digital financial architecture that aligns with macroeconomic stability, financial integrity, and global regulatory expectations.
Pakistan’s engagement with crypto has unfolded through caution, ambiguity, and incremental adjustment rather than a clearly articulated strategic vision. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) initially adopted a skeptical posture, highlighting risks to consumers, threats to financial stability, and the facilitation of illicit finance. In the absence of a defined legal framework, digital assets remained in a regulatory grey area—neither expressly banned nor effectively regulated.
The policy shift toward engagement rather than outright restriction reflects a pragmatic recognition that digital assets are not disappearing and that informal crypto activity was already occurring within Pakistan.
The gradual acceptance toward blockchain solutions for remittances, financial inclusion, and capital markets signals an attempt to harness innovation while managing risk. The challenge remains that this shift has been reactive rather than strategically planned, leaving gaps in governance, supervision, and legal clarity.
The reported agreement between Pakistan and a company linked to World Liberty Financial to explore the use of its USD1 stablecoin for cross-border payments represents the most significant and controversial step in Pakistan’s crypto journey.
The World Liberty Financial, launched in 2024 and linked to the Donald Trump family, is seeking to position itself within regulated payment systems through this partnership. The deal reportedly involves working with SBP to integrate USD1 into a regulated payments framework, though critical details remain undisclosed. The SC Financial Technologies, an associated entity, has not publicly clarified the governance, reserve backing, or legal standing of USD1. The fundamental issue is that USD1 currently lacks the regulatory foundation that most central banks would require for systemic integration.
The New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) has flagged that USD1 is behind on monthly reserve reporting, with the latest publicly available report dating back to July 2025. Additionally, the forthcoming U.S. GENIUS Act, expecting full implementation by early 2027, is likely to restrict stablecoin issuance to subsidiaries of regulated banks or state-qualified entities such as certain trust companies.
BitGo Technologies, the issuer behind USD1, may not fall within these categories, raising serious legal and compliance uncertainties. Pakistan’s central bank in this process must require proof of regulatory status, up-to-date reserve attestations, and clear custody arrangements before any integration. Delays in attestations and potential misalignment with future US law make USD1 a high-risk partner at this stage.
The economic logic behind a dollar-backed stablecoin in Pakistan is fascinating but charged with trade-offs. Stablecoin rails could significantly reduce the cost and friction of remittances, which reached approximately US$27 billion in 2023 and are expected to reach US$41 billion in fiscal year 2026, making Pakistan the largest recipient in the Initial Coin Offering (OIC). Additionally, majority of these inflows originates from the Gulf, the United Kingdom, and North America, precisely the corridors where digital payment network could deliver efficiency gains.
The cross-border fintech firms would likely enter Pakistan’s market aggressively if a regulated USD stablecoin framework emerged, competing on fees, speed, and foreign exchange distributions. The global remittance flows to low and middle income countries reached US$690 billion in 2025, greater than both foreign direct investment and official development assistance combined, highlighting the strategic importance of this market.
The opportunity is clear, but so are the risks. Introduction of a widely used dollar stablecoin could deepen de-facto dollarisation within Pakistan’s economy, deteriorating monetary sovereignty. The risk of parallel currency circulation could undermine the Pakistani rupee rather than modernize payments. The key policy question is whether such a stablecoin would complement or compete with Pakistan’s existing financial system.
The parallel initiative to tokenize up to US$2 billion in sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and commodity reserves through a memorandum of understanding with Binance represents a second pillar of Pakistan’s digital finance strategy.
Tokenisation of real world assets aims to enhance liquidity, transparency, and international investor access. The agreement reportedly covers government-owned assets such as energy reserves, metals, and financial instruments, subject to regulatory approvals.
The Federal Finance Minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, has framed this as part of Pakistan’s reform arc and a long-term partnership. The Binance founder has described the move as a signal to the global blockchain industry. The policy logic is that tokenized securities could attract new categories of investors who prefer digital settlement, fractional ownership, and programmable compliance.
READ MORE:Pakistan explores tokenisation of real-world assets to strengthen capital markets
The challenge is that tokenization does not eliminate underlying economic risks such as fiscal deficits, sovereign credit risk, or political instability. The digital wrapper cannot substitute for sound macroeconomic fundamentals.
Experience of other jurisdictions provides important lessons for Pakistan. The European Union has introduced Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation to establish clear licensing, consumer protection, and reserve requirements for stablecoins.
The United Arab Emirates has created a structured licensing regime for virtual asset service providers, combining innovation with prudential oversight. Japan has allowed regulated stablecoin issuance only through licensed banks, trust companies, or registered money transfer agents, ensuring institutional accountability.
On the contrary, Pakistan does not have a comprehensive digital assets law and instead uses limited measures like the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025. The Ordinance, in its present form, falls short of global best practices by failing to clearly define asset classification, investor protections, custodial standards, and inter-agency coordination. Lack of parliamentary legislation undermines its legitimacy and durability, making regulatory certainty fragile rather than robust.
The core problem lies in Pakistan’s tendency to adopt instruments without building systems. The stablecoins and tokenization initiatives are being pursued as separate projects rather than as components of an integrated digital financial architecture. Payments, capital markets, and cross-border flows must be interoperable, legally aligned, and institutionally coordinated.
The SBP, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, and Ministry of Finance currently operate in overlapping regulatory spaces without a single unified digital finance strategy. The absence of a national framework risks regulatory arbitrage, compliance gaps, and operational fragmentation. The digital money ecosystem should function as a single regulated stack rather than a collection of disconnected pilots.
The execution gap remains the most significant obstacle to Pakistan’s digital finance ambitions. Global experience shows that most digital money strategies fail not because of technology, but because of weak implementation, institutional turf wars, and inadequate operational infrastructure. The Pakistan’s banking system remains uneven, with significant portions of the population unbanked or underbanked, particularly in rural areas.
The integration of stablecoins into a fragmented financial environment could exacerbate differences rather than reduce them.
Additionally, cross-border value transfer requires seamless interoperability between domestic banks, fintech firms, and international payment networks. Therefore, regulatory clarity is essential to avoid legal uncertainty that discourages institutional participation. The real test will be whether Pakistan can translate high-level agreements into functioning, secure, and compliant systems at scale.
Pakistan cannot ignore FATF recommendations and its controls. The country spent years exiting the grey list, and any misstep in digital asset regulation could undo that progress. Therefore, poorly designed stablecoins can obscure beneficial ownership and enable illicit flows, while the FATF travel rule requires identifying information with every transfer, a standard, many exchanges still struggle to meet. Pakistan therefore needs strong KYC, transaction monitoring, and continuous suspicious activity reporting, supported by digital identity, blockchain analytics, and efficient law enforcement.
Emerging markets are increasingly revealing the fault lines of digital money. Fragile banking systems and a heavy reliance on cash expose the vulnerabilities of private stablecoins, while standalone Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have yet to meaningfully advance financial inclusion.
Outcomes that are more resilient appear in hybrid arrangements that integrate regulated stablecoins, tokenized assets, and conventional banking—placing Pakistan’s initiative as a critical test case of state-led digital finance operating within fiscal and institutional constraints. Pakistan’s weak institutional capacity remains a concern. The future of Pakistan’s digital money experiment will be judged not by headlines, but by institutional strength, legal clarity, and real economic outcomes.

“For the first time, we are going to do an inaugural Panda bond by the end of this month, and it’s all in the context of sustainable finance. As a country, we are one of the most vulnerable climate financing countries.
“So this is going to be a green bond which is going to help us,” he said, while speaking at a high-level panel discussion on “How Can We Unlock New Sources of Growth? – Weight of Global Debt” held on the sidelines of the WEF.
Pakistan targets $250 million for inaugural Panda bond, launch expected in January
A Panda bond is a Renminbi (RMB)-denominated bond issued by a non-Chinese entity, like a foreign company or government, within mainland China’s domestic market, offering them access to China’s investor base and supporting RMB internationalisation.
Aurangzeb underscored the importance of fiscal discipline, productive use of debt and export-led growth as key pathways to unlocking new sources of economic growth, while
Presenting an emerging markets perspective, the finance minister emphasised that debt, in itself, is not inherently negative, provided it is deployed productively.
He noted that for countries like Pakistan, debt must be directed toward investments that generate exportable surplus rather than consumption, enabling sustainable repayment and long-term growth.
He highlighted that emerging economies do not have the privilege of reserve currencies and therefore must ensure market efficiency, prudent borrowing and careful management of foreign exchange risks.
The minister stressed that unsustainable debt trajectories are fundamentally a consequence of weak fiscal discipline. He shared that Pakistan has made significant progress by reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from 75% to 70%, achieving a primary surplus and restoring fiscal balance through responsible economic management.
He added that inflation in Pakistan has declined sharply from a peak of 38% to single digits, while the policy rate has been reduced from over 22% to 10.5%, placing the country on the ‘right side’ of the interest rate cycle.
Addressing the issue of climate change, the minister stated that for Pakistan and other vulnerable emerging economies, climate risks are real, recurring and economically disruptive. He noted that building fiscal buffers has enabled Pakistan to respond to recent floods through domestic resources rather than international emergency appeals, underscoring the importance of fiscal resilience in the face of exogenous shocks.
He further highlighted the role of public-private partnerships and capital markets in financing adaptation and development projects, citing the successful closure of Pakistan’s largest-ever syndicated financing of approximately $3.6 billion for a major copper mining project.
The project, he noted, is expected to generate around $2.8 billion in exports annually from 2028, significantly strengthening Pakistan’s export base and supporting global energy transition needs.
Responding to a question from the audience on technology funding and the new economy, Aurangzeb emphasised Pakistan’s strong potential in IT, freelancing and digital services, noting recent growth in IT exports and ongoing investments in skills development, blockchain and emerging technologies.
He reiterated that access to funding is not the core challenge; rather, capacity building, prioritisation and effective execution are critical to translating opportunities into sustainable growth.","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:04:27 GMT",,capacity payments,"Pakistan targets $250 million for inaugural Panda bond, launch expected in January.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402848/opinion-the-root-cause-of-public-discontent,OPINION: The root cause of public discontent - Business Recorder,"The government narrative on the state of the economy, not surprisingly, remains extremely upbeat though there are periodic glimpses of a deep-seated concern, given the palpable general public discontent over this claim.
The objective, no doubt, is to alter market perceptions that shape consumer attitudes which, in turn, may raise consumption levels that can kick-start productivity and raise employment opportunities.
The government insists that the rise in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate is on an upward trajectory – a claim substantiated by the 3.09 percent GDP growth for 2024-25 and 3.71 percent estimated in the first quarter (July-September) of the current fiscal year announced by the national accounts committee (NAC) on 30 December 2025 (uploaded on the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics PBS website).
The main driver of this growth, the government data collection agencies point out, is higher industrial productivity reflected by rising large scale manufacturing (LSM) sector growth estimated at 5.02 percent July-November 2025 in the Finance Division’s December update and outlook compared to negative 0.62 percent in the same period last year with the very low base accounting for the bulk of the spurt in the growth calculation in the current year. The update for July-November was estimated at 6.01 percent by the PBS.
However, the crescendo of complaints by the LSM private sector has raised legitimate concerns about the accuracy of the data that include: (i) electricity cross subsidy paid for by industry raises input costs making our exports uncompetitive – a claim supported by a decline in exports – and incentivises smuggling across hundreds of miles of our porous borders; (ii) the proactive audit of industrial units – touted as enforcement – is limited to sales tax and particularly to sugar, cement and now fertilizer sub-sectors which is an indirect tax passed onto the consumers whose incidence on the poor is greater than on the rich; (iii) delayed refunds though the Islamabad High Court recently slapped a one lakh rupee fine on Commissioner Inland Revenue in his personal capacity that may eventually be paid by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) as a Commissioner must get the Board’s approval for any submissions in court; (iv) a 10.5 percent discount rate which, though more than halved from the 22 percent in May 2024, is still more than double the regional average; and (v) the freezing of accounts as penalty for non-payment of due taxes as determined by the FBR prior to the filing of appeals.
All Pakistan Textile Mills Association claims that 150 units have closed down during the past year and a half as a consequence of these flawed decisions while Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association revealed that over 100 spinning units have shut down leading to shortages of yarn and fabric with most of the large scale units that once operated two shifts forced to operate a single shift.
Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers is now operating at 30 to 50 percent capacity producing 3.8 million tons per year against the installed capacity of 9 million tons. And cement dispatches fell by 3.47 percent in November 2025 year-on-year to 4.14 million tons though total dispatches rose by 11.54 percent during the first five months of the current year.
Data of the number of closures accounts for Pakistan’s industrial sector’s challenge to government claim of a 6.01 percent LSM growth July-November 2025.
The Finance Minister while addressing the Pakistan Policy Dialogue held on Wednesday this week past acknowledged the closure of multinationals but added that: (i) there is a need for a new business model rather than adhering to a 90-year-old model – he needs reminding that Pakistan has been a sovereign country for only 78.5 years, besides it is doubtful that any private sector company set up even a century ago would have followed a business model that does not aim to maximise profits; (ii) there have been 20 new foreign investors during the past 18 months – a claim not backed by government data given that foreign direct investment July-June 2024-25 was USD 2,489.7 million, an amount that compares rather unfavourably with India’s USD 81 billion, with USD 1,242.4 million inflows during July-November 2024 against USD 927.4 million July-November 2025 – a decline of 25 percent; portfolio investment declined from positive USD 148.7 million July-November 2024 to negative USD 613 million July-November 2025.
Another set of statistics released by the PBS is challenging the government claim that the economy is generating higher employment.
The recently released Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2024-25 indicated the following disturbing trends when compared with the LFS 2020-21: (i) Pakistan’s unemployment rate has risen to 7.09 percent to nearly 8 percent up from 6.3 percent in LFS 2020-21 across all age groups; (ii) this increase was observed both in case of males (5.5 percent in LFS 2020-21 to 5.9 in the 2024-25 LFS) and females (8.9 percent to 9.7 percent); (iii) area- wise disaggregated figures indicate that unemployment rate is up both in urban (7.3 percent in LFS 2020-21 to 8.0 percent in 2024-25) and in rural areas (5.8 percent to 6.3 percent); and (iv) unemployment rate is the highest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 9.63 percent up from 8.8 percent in LFS 2020-21 (with crude participation rate at 29.22 percent), followed by Punjab at 7.27 percent (a rise from LFS 2020-21 of 6.8 percent) with a crude participation rate of 35.66 percent and Balochistan at 5.54 percent - a rise when compared with LFS 2020-21 of 4.3 percent with a crude participation rate of 27.86 percent. Sindh performed the best, even though it too suffered from a rise in unemployment – 5.28 percent in LFS 2024-25 against 3.9 percent in LFS 2020-21 and a crude participation rate of 31.66 percent.
The share of formal sector in employment is a mere 27.5 percent in 2024-25 LFS, a disturbing claim, against 27.6 percent in LFS 2020-21 (males accounting for 26.6 percent and females 73.4 percent females in LFS 2020-21 against 27.3 percent males and 72.5 percent females in LFS 2024-25); the informal sector accounted for 72.5 percent in LFS 2024-25 against 72.4 percent in LFS 2020-21 (males accounting for 34.5 percent in LFS 2024-25 against 26.6 percent in LFS 2020-21 and women accounting for 65.5 percent in the two LFS). The minimum wage is not enforceable in the informal sector.
The wages of the informal sector are at best a projection which may account for PBS to note that “notwithstanding complete observance of the requisite codes to ensure reliability of data coefficient variations and confidence intervals (were) computed in the backdrop of 5 percent margin of error,” a rather high margin which critics may argue challenges claims of data integrity. This is strengthened by the wage data revealed which claims that the highest wages are in Balochistan at 27,659 rupees per month, followed by Sindh at 24,664 rupees, KPK at 24.028 and the lowest in Punjab at 23,367 rupees.
LFS 2020-21 gives the average all Pakistan wage at 24,028 rupees per month, while the LFS 2024-25 notes a significant rise to 39042 rupees per month – a rise of 62 percent. However, this is for the formal sector – 34964 to 54038 rupees per month – a rise of 54.5 percent.
The bulk of this raise is accounted for by the 7 percent of civilian and military personnel whose salaries are paid by the taxpayers’ and who witnessed a massive increase, well above the rate of inflation, in every fiscal year.
The informal sector wage rose from 17,529 rupees per month in LFS 2020-21 to 30834 rupees per month – an estimate at best. However, these are estimates at best and are subject to considerable survey and surveyed bias.
The purchasing power of each rupee earned each year is best reflected by the rate of inflation: in 2020-21 inflation was estimated at a low of 8.9 percent however next year it rose to a high of 29.18 percent and in 2023-24 it was 23.41 percent.
The average inflation in 2024-25 was a low of 4.49 percent.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403027/govt-working-on-proposals-to-reduce-industrial-power-tariff,Govt working on proposals to reduce industrial power tariff - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is reportedly working on three proposals to reduce the industrial electricity tariff to 9 cents per kWh by eliminating cross-subsidy — one of the key demands of export-oriented industries for years,Business Recorderhas learnt from reliable sources.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) determined the tariffs for distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs 33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs 34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26.
For industrial consumers, the B-2 ToU rate has been fixed at Rs 34.47/kWh, B-3 ToU at Rs 33.26/kWh, and B-4 ToU at Rs 33.04/kWh.
The government will notify revised tariffs after incorporating available subsidies in line with its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Last month, the Power Division briefed the highest forum that industrial consumers are currently being charged a base variable rate of Rs 29.25 per unit against the Nepra-determined rate of Rs 23.88 per unit, effectively cross-subsidising domestic consumers by Rs 5.37 per unit.
Eliminating this cross-subsidy would require an additional budgetary allocation of Rs 160 billion per annum — Rs 131 billion for Discos and Rs 29 billion for K-Electric.
Explaining the rationale, sources said the move would make Pakistani industry regionally competitive and encourage higher production and exports. More affordable and predictable electricity tariffs would promote higher capacity utilisation, formalisation of industrial activity, and reinvestment in existing facilities. The reform is also expected to improve power sector efficiency by reducing reliance on captive generation, strengthening grid demand, and promoting a transparent and equitable tariff structure — thereby supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation.
Based on data from the past 50 years, the price elasticity of demand is estimated at 0.22 percent, meaning a Rs 1 per unit reduction in tariff results in additional consumption of 265 GWh. Accordingly, a Rs 5.37 per unit reduction is expected to increase industrial electricity consumption by at least 1,423 GWh. This incremental demand is projected to raise real GDP by Rs 360 billion and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 28.5 billion.
The overall fiscal impact of this proposal would be Rs 160 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.
Sources further noted that the power sector budget has been reduced from Rs 1,287 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs 893 billion in FY 2025-26 due to efficiency gains, and these savings should be utilised to enhance affordability and sustainability in the power sector.
Proposal 2
After removal of cross-subsidy, the all-inclusive pre-tax industrial tariff would be Rs 31.34 per unit — comprising Rs 23.88 per unit variable charge, Rs 4.23 per unit fixed charge, and Rs 3.23 per unit DSS—equivalent to around 11 cents per kWh (at an exchange rate of Rs 280). A further reduction of Rs 6.13 per unit would bring the final tariff down to 9 cents per kWh.
This would require an additional budgetary support of Rs 182 billion per annum —Rs 150 billion for Discos and Rs 32 billion for K-Electric — through fiscalisation of power producers’ debt, with the resulting generation cost relief ring-fenced for industrial consumers.
If approved, this proposal would restore industrial competitiveness, boost production and exports, and drive economic growth. Sources said reducing the final industrial tariff to 9 cents would significantly enhance the global competitiveness of Pakistan’s export-oriented and energy-intensive sectors, encourage reinvestment and expansion, and reduce dependence on captive power generation. Fiscalising legacy power sector debt would separate past inefficiencies from current consumption decisions and strengthen confidence in the policy framework.
A Rs 6.13 per unit tariff reduction is expected to increase industrial consumption by at least 1,624 GWh, raise real GDP by Rs 411 billion, and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 32.5 billion, with a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum.
If the first two proposals are approved, the industrial tariff would be fixed at Rs 25.21 per kWh (9 cents), requiring a total subsidy of Rs 342 billion. However, electricity consumption would increase by 3,047 GWh, real GDP would rise by Rs 771 billion, and additional tax revenue of Rs 61 billion would be generated.
Proposal 3
The third proposal relates to the inclusion of greenfield industries in the Grid Sustainability Package (GSP) 2025. The government has announced the GSP as a subsidy-neutral mechanism to unlock latent demand by offering electricity at the marginal cost of 8 cents per kWh for consumption above a defined baseline.
While the IMF approved the GSP, it did not allow the discounted rate to apply to the entire consumption of greenfield industries. The Power Division has requested that discussions with the IMF be reopened to include greenfield industries in full, in order to ensure grid sustainability, enhance industrial competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth.
The Power Division believes that since the current tariff structure already ensures full recovery of fixed costs through base consumption, extending the GSP rate to the entire load of greenfield data centres, crypto-mining facilities, and copper and aluminium industries would not compromise cost recovery. IMF-approved safeguards — including a 25 percent cap on aggregate incremental consumption, semi-annual reviews, and a termination clause—further mitigate fiscal and system-level risks.
Sources said these greenfield industries, particularly data centres and crypto-mining operations, have significant potential to absorb surplus power, improve system load factors, stabilise grid operations during low-demand periods, and strengthen the financial sustainability of the power sector.
Quantitative analysis using macroeconomic indicators shows that each additional 1 GWh of electricity sales adds Rs 253 million to real GDP. Although aluminium smelting and copper refining are energy-intensive, they generate tradable output and strong local supply chains involving mining, logistics, and exports. While the economic productivity per unit of electricity is lower for data centres and crypto-mining, these sectors still contribute meaningfully to GDP growth and tax revenues.
If approved, this proposal would have a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.

In a letter to Executive Director Finance Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority Altaf Hussain, Secretary General OCAC, Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi referenced Ogra letter of January 13, 2026, and the meeting held on January 14, 2026, chaired by the Chairman Ogra, wherein various issues concerning the oil industry and the oil industry’s response regarding the recovery of line fill financing cost were deliberated.
The OCAC reiterated that the matter of line fill financing cost recovery-particularly the rate used for recovery had already been highlighted by the industry in its earlier correspondence of July 4, 2024.

Despite this, the issue remains unresolved and continues to adversely impact the financial sustainability of Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).
According to the industry, Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR) is widely recognised as a benchmark reference rate; however, it does not represent the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs.
In practice, banks extend financing to OMCs at a premium over KIBOR, typically around KIBOR plus 2percent, reflecting credit risk, tenor, and other standard banking considerations.
Accordingly, recovery of line fill financing cost at KIBOR alone does not reflect the true and unavoidable cost being borne by the industry.
Based on the financing levels currently incorporated in IFEM, the financial impact of this mismatch for the line fill during the period January-June 2025 un-recovered variance was Rs. 814,231,167 (approximately Rs. 814 million); (i) financing cost recovered at average KIBOR (11.07percent): Rs. 4,508,126,561; and (ii) actual financing cost at KIBOR (11.07percent) + 2percent: Rs. 5,322,357,727.
This un-recovered amount represents a material financing cost currently being absorbed by OMCs. In the prevailing interest-rate environment, such partial recovery is exerting significant pressure on cash flows, working capital, and the overall financial health of the industry.
Continued non-recovery of actual costs is neither sustainable nor consistent with the principle of cost neutrality embedded in the regulatory framework.
OCAC has emphasised that line fill is a regulatory and operational necessity, essential for ensuring uninterrupted and efficient supply of petroleum products through pipeline infrastructure.
Consequently, the financing cost associated with line fill is legitimate, unavoidable, and directly attributable to regulatory operational compliance. Non-recognition of the KIBOR premium component; therefore, effectively results in partial disallowance of actual costs, which is not on merit and undermines fairness.
In this context, OCAC has submitted that Ogra-being the regulator and monitor of the oil industry—has a critical role in ensuring that genuine and prudently incurred costs are fully recoverable.
Aligning the allowed financing rate with the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs, including the applicable premium over KIBOR, would restore cost neutrality, support industry viability, and help safeguard uninterrupted supply to the national economy.
After explaining the issue, OCAC has requested Ogra to review and rationalise the existing recovery methodology for line fill financing cost and allow recovery at the actual financing rate incurred by OMCs. This measure would meaningfully reduce financial pressure on the industry.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403012,Industrial power tariffs as tool for cross-subsidy: Tanveer says approach eroding industrial competitiveness - Business Recorder,"LAHORE: FPCCI leader and Patron-in-Chief UBG S M Tanveer has expressed serious concerns over the continued use of industrial electricity tariffs as a tool for cross subsidy, warning that this approach is steadily eroding Pakistan’s industrial competitiveness and export capacity.
He stated that industrial tariffs are currently carrying a cross subsidy burden ranging from Rs 4.5 to Rs 7 per unit, with a total impact of Rs 131 billion, which translates into an additional cost of nearly 20 percent on already expensive electricity. According to him, industry is barely managing to carry its own burden, and this extra cost is pushing many units towards closure or long term contraction.
S M Tanveer pointed out that over the past few years, the number of protected consumers has almost doubled, yet instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal space, the government has chosen the easier route of loading this burden onto industry. He said this policy effectively uses industry as a balancing item for systemic failures, even though industry is the only segment that consistently pays, consumes, and creates employment.
He strongly urged the government and the Minister for Energy Power Division to immediately remove cross subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs and to stop using industry as a substitute for fiscal reform.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403068/opinion-solar-success-system-strain-why-policy-must-catch-up,"OPINION: Solar success, system strain: why policy must catch up - Business Recorder","Pakistan’s rooftop solar revolution has delivered cleaner power at record speed, but without urgent policy resets, it risks destabilising the very grid it depends on. The scale and speed of adoption have exposed structural faults in a system designed for one-way power flows from large, centralized generators. While policy responses are now emerging, failure to align incentives with system realities could still trade short-term gains for long-term grid fragmentation and inequity.
The numbers are eye-opening. With over 50 GW of solar panels imported into Pakistan in just five years, the country has witnessed one of the fastest market-driven clean energy transitions in the region. This surge has dramatically reshaped daytime electricity demand while leaving evening peaks largely unchanged, creating the classic “duck curve” that forces utilities to maintain costly standby capacity.
At the same time, a rapid influx of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is emerging alongside rooftop solar installations. Industrial and commercial consumers, in particular, are increasingly deploying BESS to manage load-shedding, avoid peak tariffs, and insulate operations from grid volatility.
While this shift can improve reliability and flatten demand peaks, its system-wide impacts on load forecasting, tariff recovery, grid operations, safety standards, and end-of-life management have yet to be fully assessed or reflected in regulation.
Yet the financing behind this transformation remains largely opaque. The solar-and-storage boom is being driven primarily by households and firms with access to upfront capital, while lower-income consumers remain effectively locked out of the transition. As a result, the benefits of reduced bills, energy autonomy, and resilience accrue disproportionately to better-capitalized users, even as the fixed costs of maintaining the grid are increasingly borne by consumers with no access to distributed generation.
The release of draft revisions to the NEPRA (Prosumer) Regulations, 2025 reflects an emerging regulatory consensus that Pakistan’s rooftop solar expansion is beginning to strain grid operations and cost recovery. The regulations codify a shift from net metering to net billing, replacing retail-rate compensation with credits based on the national average energy purchase price. This change recognizes that exported rooftop electricity has a system value distinct from retail consumption and must be priced accordingly.
That change in demand has material consequences for the financing of the power system. Transmission and distribution networks, capacity charges, and system-balancing services represent largely fixed or lumpy costs; they do not shrink in proportion to the kilowatt-hours an individual household consumes.
When affluent consumers install rooftop PV and export surplus during daylight hours, they reduce their bills but continue to rely on the same wires, substations, and balancing services every evening. The residual cost must therefore be recovered from a shrinking pool of consumers, many of whom cannot afford distributed generation.
The new prosumer regulations partially address this imbalance by delinking export compensation from retail tariffs. However, they stop short of introducing explicit grid-access or capacity charges. As a result, fixed network costs remain socialized across non-solar consumers, leaving unresolved the equity concerns that accompany rapid rooftop adoption.
READ MORE:Pakistan’s solar rush unlocked $17-19bn in private investment in 8 years: study
Recognizing technical constraints, the regulations also empower distribution companies to refuse new connections where distributed generation capacity reaches 80% of a transformer’s rated capacity, and to require load-flow studies for larger installations. These safeguards implicitly validate the concern that unmanaged rooftop growth can overload local networks, reinforcing the need for planning tools that anticipate not react to distributed generation impacts.
The revised framework reflects a broader fiscal reality. Pakistan’s power sector continues to carry legacy liabilities and circular debt, and the federal government has recently relied on substantial financing packages to stabilize sector finances. In this context, policies that further erode distribution company revenues without addressing cost recovery risk deepening fiscal stress and political backlash.
None of this should be read as an argument against rooftop solar. Distributed PV reduces fuel imports, cuts emissions, and improves resilience. The challenge is no longer whether rooftop solar should grow, but how it should be integrated so that private benefits do not undermine collective infrastructure.
To that end, three pragmatic policy directions remain essential.
First, remuneration must be aligned with system value through the continued rollout of net billing combined with time-of-use tariffs. Net billing alone reduces regressive cross-subsidies, but without temporal price signals it cannot address the mismatch between daytime exports and evening demand.
Second, transparent and modest grid-access or capacity charges should be introduced to ensure all connected users contribute fairly to fixed network costs. Such charges should be carefully designed, with exemptions or lifeline thresholds for low-income consumers, to avoid undermining energy access while preventing cost shifting from large exporters to vulnerable households.
Third, incentives must pivot toward storage and demand-side management. Battery prices have fallen sharply, yet the current regulatory framework remains silent on encouraging hybrid solar-plus-storage systems or compensating prosumers for providing grid services. Without these incentives, the duck curve will persist, merely flattened rather than resolved.
The regulations provide procedural clarity through defined timelines and renewable five-year agreements, but the ability to revise export rates during the agreement term introduces uncertainty for investors. Predictable transition pathways rather than discretionary revisions will be critical to channeling investment toward grid-friendly technologies such as storage, smart inverters, and managed electric-vehicle charging.
These reforms are not unprecedented. Mature markets in Europe and North America have moved away from flat retail net metering toward net billing, dynamic tariffs, and grid-usage fees while preserving strong solar uptake. Citizen empowerment was not extinguished; it was redirected into models that are technically sound and economically sustainable.
For distribution companies, the imperative is to engage constructively with regulators and consumers to implement reforms that are evidence-based, transparent, and phased. Sudden reversals or opaque policymaking invite uncertainty and backlash; predictable transitions mobilize investment in storage, smart meters, and grid-edge services that benefit all users.
For consumers, the message remains straightforward: rooftop solar is a public good, but it is also part of a shared system. Individual energy independence should not erode the collective infrastructure that guarantees supply for everyone.
One critical issue still waiting in the wings is the end-of-life management of solar panels. With an average lifespan of 25-30 years, today’s installations will become tomorrow’s waste stream. The absence of any provision for environmentally sound disposal, recycling, or extended producer responsibility in the current regulatory framework risks replacing fuel imports with unmanaged solar waste undermining the sustainability narrative that solar power promises.
Pakistan’s new prosumer regulations mark a necessary evolution from unpriced exports toward system-aware compensation. But regulation alone is not reform. Without complementary measures on storage, grid-access pricing, demand management, and lifecycle responsibility, the country risks solving yesterday’s tariff problem while sowing tomorrow’s technical, fiscal, and environmental challenges.

In Pakistan, a nation with a population of approximately 250 million, the promise of digital health seems tantalizingly within reach. Multiple systems and databases are being built; hospitals are generating electronic logs, and health apps are proliferating. However, despite this surge in data collection, the core issue remains: interoperability. Without the ability to exchange, link, and meaningfully use health data across platforms and providers, these systems become little more than expensive add-ons.
Recent research shows that while Pakistan has nascent digital health initiatives, major barriers persist: “limited capacity… for being able to use data to advance health”, and “multiple barriers … including platforms for sharing data, interoperability and defined win-win scenarios.”
However, many facilities still rely predominantly on paper-based systems. A study found that the health information system “partially existed at district and sub-district offices, while was completely absent at tertiary, secondary and primary healthcare levels.”
This means that hospitals may have databases, but if those databases cannot communicate with each other and cannot trace a patient’s journey across clinics, laboratories, insurers, and hospitals, then the investment yields little insight and coordination and leaves patients vulnerable.
Meanwhile, the cost of creating these standalone systems adds to the overall healthcare expenditure without delivering the expected returns in terms of efficiency, safety, or equity.
Digitizing records is no longer optional; it is a dire need of the hour. However, digitization alone is not sufficient. To realize the full value of data, Pakistan must build interoperable systems: databases that are connected, standards that are shared, and workflows that cross institutional boundaries. Only then can health data become actionable, enabling continuity of care, informed policy-making, and real-time public health responses, rather than remaining locked-in islands of information.
In the sections that follow, we unpack the key discrepancies that arise when manual (or siloed digital) health systems dominate in Pakistan, from patient experience to national health planning, and why bridging these gaps is vital for a just, efficient, and high-performing health system.
The weight of paper: how manual records cripple Pakistan’s healthcare system
Walk into any government hospital or small private clinic in Pakistan, and you will find the same scene repeated: rows of steel cabinets filled with crumbling patient files, overworked clerks leafing through paper registers, and doctors scribbling hurried notes on prescription pads.
Despite scattered attempts at digitization, the bulk of healthcare documentation in Pakistan remains paper-based, a reality that has quietly shaped every inefficiency faced by patients and providers.
A patient with diabetes in Multan, for instance, may visit three different clinics in six months, none of which has access to her previous lab results. Each visit starts with a blank file, repeated tests, and another consultation fee. This cycle is repeated endlessly.
Paper records have inherent limitations that compound over time. They are static, fragile, and non-shareable. A patient treated at one facility leaves with a file that has no digital counterpart, meaning that when they visit another clinic, their story starts all over again. The test results are redone, history is retaken, and medication lists are rewritten. This repetitive cycle not only wastes precious clinical time but also increases costs for both patients and the health system.
The consequences for clinicians are equally draining. Without an integrated record system, information retrieval is a manual, error-prone process, misplaced lab results, undocumented treatment plans, and unrecorded allergies. In high-volume facilities, missing files can delay surgeries or even misdirect treatments. A single data gap in a paper can lead to life-threatening outcomes.
On an institutional level, manual records mean no visibility, analytics, or learning loops. Hospitals cannot easily monitor disease patterns, manage their inventory, or track their performance. Health administrators rely on end-of-month summaries compiled manually, which are often riddled with inaccuracies. The absence of real-time data makes it nearly impossible to forecast outbreaks, allocate resources effectively and plan preventive interventions.
The irony runs deep: while Pakistan’s financial and telecom sectors have embraced real-time digital ecosystems, its health sector is still anchored in pen-and-paper systems that belong to a bygone era. For facilities that have adopted basic digital tools, these often exist as isolated silos, unable to exchange information or follow a patient beyond their own premises.
This brings us to the core of the national challenge: in a fragmented landscape where health systems do not communicate with each other and paper still dominates, the absence of clear government policy and interoperability standards has left the sector without a unifying direction.
The policy vacuum: when innovation outpaces governance
While Pakistan’s healthcare providers are still grappling with paper-based systems, another challenge is the absence of a clear, unified digital health policy. Without strategic direction or regulatory enforcement, digitization efforts across the country are disjointed, reactive, and often redundant.
The federal and provincial health departments have long acknowledged the need for digital transformation; however, progress remains fragmented. There is no national mandate on electronic health record (EHR) standards, no established framework for interoperability, and no governing authority enforcing compliance with data exchange protocols such as HL7 or FHIR. The result is a patchwork of disconnected systems, rather than a cohesive digital ecosystem.
This policy void also affects how data flows — or rather, fails to flow — between stakeholders. Hospitals, laboratories, pharmacies, and insurers all operate on independent databases with no national Health Information Exchange (HIE) to connect them. Even provincial health data repositories, where they exist, function as static archives rather than dynamic, real-time systems that can generate actionable insights.
Furthermore, there are no enforceable data security or privacy regulations tailored to healthcare, leaving sensitive patient data exposed to breaches, misuse, or commercial exploitation. The lack of a central data governance authority not only hinders accountability but also discourages institutions from sharing data, a cultural and operational barrier that perpetuates isolation.
In such an environment, innovation often outpaces regulations. Startups, private hospitals, and tech vendors are developing digital health platforms to fill these gaps, which is an encouraging trend. However, without interoperability guidelines or policy oversight, these solutions are growing in silos, each using its own data schema, storage conventions and exchange formats.
Today, fewer than five percent of Pakistan’s healthcare facilities use any form of structured electronic record keeping. Among those that do, most systems do not conform to HL7/FHIR standards, making cross-platform communication nearly impossible. The irony is striking: as HealthTech companies rise, many build proprietary EHRs designed entirely around in-house data models, inadvertently creating the next generation of data silos.
If this continues unchecked, the health sector could soon find itself facing a new kind of fragmentation — one where digital systems exist, but each speaks a private language, making national interoperability even harder to achieve.
Emerging islands of innovation: the digital shift without a common language
Despite the absence of a unified national policy, Pakistan’s health sector has made progress. Over the past few years, a wave of HealthTech startups and digital platforms has begun to reshape healthcare access and management. From teleconsultation apps and e-pharmacy networks to hospital management systems and insurance technology solutions, this quiet digital revolution signals that the sector is ready to evolve.
However, when seen in totality, these efforts represent less than five percent of the digital transformation Pakistan needs to bring its healthcare infrastructure into the 21st century. Most of these platforms operate within narrow domains — limited to outpatient consultations, pharmacy logistics, or hospital operations — rather than being part of a broader, interoperable ecosystem.
The core challenge lies in the lack of common technical standards. Health data across these digital systems exist in multiple formats, often determined by the internal logic of the software vendor. Without alignment on HL7 (Health Level Seven) or Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards, the global frameworks that define how health information should be structured and exchanged, these systems cannot “speak” to each other.
This lack of standardization has serious implications. Imagine a patient who consults via one telemedicine app, gets lab results from another, and fills prescriptions through a third, each storing data in its own proprietary database. None of these systems can synchronize or cross-reference information with each other. The result is digital fragmentation, a mirror image of the manual chaos Pakistan was meant to escape.
The growing number of companies branding themselves as HealthTech further complicates this picture. Many offer EHR or hospital management solutions developed around closed, in-house data models. While such tools may appear functional for individual facilities, they pose long-term interoperability risk. Once hundreds of clinics and hospitals begin using EHRs designed in unique, incompatible formats, national-level data unification becomes exponentially harder; every dataset becomes a locked vault, each with its own key.
However, vision alone cannot connect systems; it must be engineered through a structured national roadmap.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402534/federal-govt-punctures-claims-of-stronger-provincial-tax-performance,Federal govt punctures claims of stronger provincial tax performance - Business Recorder,"Khurram Schehzad, Advisor to the Finance Minister of Pakistan, has challenged claims that Pakistan’s provinces are outperforming the centre in tax collection, presenting Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) data that shows provincial revenues remain far below their potential, despite having large constitutionally assigned tax bases.
“There’s a claim circulating that provincial tax performance has been better than the federal, and that this should settle the debate on whether resource allocation needs revisiting,” said Schehzad, in a post on X Friday. “The factual details point to a different conclusion.”
According to FBR figures for FY25, shared by Schehzad, the federal government collected over Rs13 trillion in taxes and levies, equivalent to 11.3% of GDP. “Federal collections are on a trajectory to reach 15% of GDP by June 2028,” he said.
In contrast, combined provincial tax collections stood at just Rs979 billion, or 0.85% of GDP, well short of the roughly 3% contribution expected from provinces in comparable federal systems.
The advisor argued that the debate over resource allocation and fiscal federalism should be grounded in outcomes rather than perceptions. “The issue is not the size of the tax base, but the revenue yield from it,” said Schehzad.

“For countries at Pakistan’s level of development, the benchmark is 18% tax-to-GDP, with 15% of GDP expected from federal taxes, and the rest from provinces/states,” he said. While federal collections are steadily closing this gap, provincial revenues would need to more than triple by FY28 to reach their expected share.
“Provincial governments have large constitutionally assigned tax handles, yet collections remain far below what the economic base suggests,” said Schehzad.
A breakdown of sector-wise data from FBR highlighted large disparities in collection efficiency. The services sector, which falls under provincial jurisdiction, has an estimated taxable base of Rs29 trillion, yet provinces collected only Rs650 billion, translating into a yield of just 2.2%.
By comparison, the federally administered goods sector, with a similar taxable base of around Rs30 trillion, generated Rs3.9 trillion, reflecting a 13% yield, said Schehzad.
The shortfall is even more pronounced in agricultural income tax, another provincial subject. Despite an estimated taxable base of Rs3.7 trillion, provinces collected only Rs8.4 billion, a yield of only 0.2%.
Property-related taxes — including stamp duties and urban immovable property tax — also remain significantly underutilised. Against an estimated real estate asset base of Rs21.7 trillion, provincial collections amounted to just Rs66 billion, or 0.3%.
“Federal collections are already at 11.3% of GDP and moving toward benchmark levels. Provincial collections, combined, remain at 0.85% of GDP, far below the 3% expectation, despite substantial tax bases in services, agriculture, and property sectors,” said Schehzad.
The advisor noted that provincial revenue potential remains largely untapped. “Progress demands a balanced reform agenda with stronger revenue efforts at every level.
“Federal and provincial governments are partners; closing provincial tax gaps, alongside federal reform, is key to better services, lower fiscal stress, and a fairer federation,” he said.","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:46:32 GMT",,bill collection efficiency,"Khurram Schehzad, Advisor to the Finance Minister of Pakistan, has challenged claims that Pakistan’s provinces are outperforming the centre in tax collection.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402774,Power Planning and Monitoring Company failed to meet key targets: AGP - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has said Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) has failed to achieve multiple Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets assigned under the National Electricity Plan (NEP) 2023-27 up to the FY 2024-25.
Section-6.2.4 of National Electricity Policy-2021 provides that for the purposes of section 6.2 and 5.3.5, the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) may designate any entity (or entities) to perform the tasks assigned under these sections.
According to Ministry of Energy (Power Division) letter of October 30, 2023, in pursuance to the National Action Plan (2023-27), PPMC and PIU of CPPA-G as “designated entities” for implementation of priority areas (tasks) as mentioned against each. After PPMC is fully manned, it would be a sole designated entity. During audit of the accounts of MD, PPMC Islamabad for 2024-25, it was observed that Designated Entity, ie, PPMC had failed to achieve multiple Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets assigned under the NEP 2023-27 upto the FY 2024-25.
AGP raises questions over ‘malfeasance’ in Power Division think tank
These included non-achievement of critical deliverables such as development of the integrated energy plan design, establishment of the Central Electrification Registry, institutionalization of strategic risk management, preparation of system value and tariff evaluation frameworks, operationalisation of MRV mechanism for GHG emissions, establishment of the R&D Secretariat, development of the Central Platform for R&D, initiation of minimum required R&D projects, and publishing of due-diligence and electrification reports within mandated timelines.
According to AGP, the lapse occurred due to insufficient institutional capacity, delays in staffing and operationalisation of PPMC, lack of a robust internal monitoring mechanism for tracking NEP deliverables, and inadequate coordination with CPPA-G and other sectoral stakeholders.
Furthermore, strategic planning functions were not fully established, resulting in weak implementation oversight and slow progress on mandated tasks. Failure to meet these NEP targets has resulted in delays in sectoral reforms, weakened progress toward national electrification, de-carbonization, risk management, and R&D institutionalization objectives, and compromised the Government’s ability to implement the National Action Plan (2023-27) within stipulated timelines.
“Inefficient performance resulted in non-achievement of key deliverables of the National Electricity Plan 2023-27 by designated entity PPMC upto the period 2024-25,” the AGP said adding that the matter was taken up with the management in December, 2025. No reply was received to date.
Audit has recommended that PPMC should immediately develop and implement a robust action plan to achieve all pending NEP 2023-27 deliverables within stipulated timelines. The Ministry of Energy (Power Division) should strengthen monitoring, reporting,
The AGP further stated that during audit of the accounts of MD, PPMC Islamabad for 2024-25, it was observed that despite the Cabinet’s approval to transfer the function of developing uniform designs, standards, and specifications (11kV and below) for distribution sector from NGC/NTDC to PPMC, and subsequent instructions by Power Division on 19.05.2025, the designated function was neither timely established nor fully operationalised.
The BoD in its meeting held on April 10,2025 approved the inclusion of the strategy energy Financing and Design and Standards functions within the organizational structure of PPMC and HR and Legal Committee in its 139th meeting of May 26, 2025 approved the 15 posts excluding support staff. However, delays persisted in deployment of technical HR, transfer of documentation, systems handover, and establishment of operational readiness. As a result, functional control over distribution design and specifications remained fragmented between NGC/NTDC and PPMC.
The AGP maintained that this delay, caused by inadequate follow-up after Cabinet approval, absence of a structured implementation roadmap, and slow migration of resources, has led to non-uniform technical standards across DISCOs, risks of procurement and design inconsistencies, potential quality deviations, and hindered achievement of the National Electricity Policy 2021 goal of a standardized, efficient, and optimized distribution system.
Non-adherence to cabinet directive and NEP-2021 resulted in delayed transfer and non-operationalisation of design, standards and specification (DSS) function from NGC to PPM? upto the period 2024-25. The matter was taken up with the management in December, 2025. No reply was received to date.
Audit recommended that PPMC should expedite full operationalisation of the design & standards function by completing staff deployment, system transfer, and implementation milestones in line with cabinet directives and NEP-2021.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403570/br-research-power-generation-inches-up-slightly,BR RESEARCH: Power generation inches up slightly - Business Recorder,"Pakistan’s national grid power generation in 1HFY26 remained 10 percent below the peak observed in 1HFY22. At 65 billion kilowatt hours, output was still lower than the same period in 2020, and only marginally higher than levels recorded in 2018 and 2019.
December, however, stood out from the broader trend. It marked only the third instance in the past 18 months where actual generation exceeded reference generation.
On a year-on-year basis, December generation was up 9 percent, the strongest growth recorded so far in FY26. This improvement coincided with the introduction of the winter consumption incentive package, which became effective from December and appears to have played a meaningful role in lifting demand.
This is in addition to the ongoing reintegration of previously captive industrial consumers into the grid, which has resulted in industrial demand from the grid rising by as much as 35 percent year on year.
Despite these tailwinds, cumulative generation in 1HFY26 improved by barely 1 percent compared to last year, implying a pronounced contraction in other demand segments, particularly domestic and agricultural consumption.
While aggregate generation exceeded reference levels, the composition of supply presents a more instructive picture. Seasonal weakness in hydel output shifted the burden towards imported fuels.
RLNG based generation was around 25 percent higher than planned, while imported coal recorded the most significant deviation. Actual coal-based generation rose to 860 million units against a reference of 422 million units. This reliance on costlier imported fuels largely explains the upward pressure seen in monthly fuel charge adjustments.
Demand patterns are also reshaping operational dynamics. Evening demand spikes following sunset are becoming more pronounced, increasing reliance on RLNG and coal fired plants to meet short term load requirements. These plants are increasingly central to managing ramp up needs as the system adjusts to changing consumption behavior.
With the incremental consumption relief package for industry and agriculture now in place, the trajectory of grid demand will hinge to the extent to which these incentives translate into sustained usage.
While industrial feedback has so far been sharply critical, this response may be overstated. With a substantial number of captive users already shifted back to the grid and incremental consumption priced at a meaningful discount, industrial demand should continue to strengthen, assuming no adverse policy or pricing shocks.","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:48:08 GMT",,power generation Pakistan,"Pakistan’s national grid power generation remained 10 percent below the peak observed in 1HFY22.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403027,Govt working on proposals to reduce industrial power tariff - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is reportedly working on three proposals to reduce the industrial electricity tariff to 9 cents per kWh by eliminating cross-subsidy — one of the key demands of export-oriented industries for years,Business Recorderhas learnt from reliable sources.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) determined the tariffs for distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs 33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs 34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26.
For industrial consumers, the B-2 ToU rate has been fixed at Rs 34.47/kWh, B-3 ToU at Rs 33.26/kWh, and B-4 ToU at Rs 33.04/kWh.
The government will notify revised tariffs after incorporating available subsidies in line with its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Last month, the Power Division briefed the highest forum that industrial consumers are currently being charged a base variable rate of Rs 29.25 per unit against the Nepra-determined rate of Rs 23.88 per unit, effectively cross-subsidising domestic consumers by Rs 5.37 per unit.
Eliminating this cross-subsidy would require an additional budgetary allocation of Rs 160 billion per annum — Rs 131 billion for Discos and Rs 29 billion for K-Electric.
Explaining the rationale, sources said the move would make Pakistani industry regionally competitive and encourage higher production and exports. More affordable and predictable electricity tariffs would promote higher capacity utilisation, formalisation of industrial activity, and reinvestment in existing facilities. The reform is also expected to improve power sector efficiency by reducing reliance on captive generation, strengthening grid demand, and promoting a transparent and equitable tariff structure — thereby supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation.
Based on data from the past 50 years, the price elasticity of demand is estimated at 0.22 percent, meaning a Rs 1 per unit reduction in tariff results in additional consumption of 265 GWh. Accordingly, a Rs 5.37 per unit reduction is expected to increase industrial electricity consumption by at least 1,423 GWh. This incremental demand is projected to raise real GDP by Rs 360 billion and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 28.5 billion.
The overall fiscal impact of this proposal would be Rs 160 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.
Sources further noted that the power sector budget has been reduced from Rs 1,287 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs 893 billion in FY 2025-26 due to efficiency gains, and these savings should be utilised to enhance affordability and sustainability in the power sector.
Proposal 2
After removal of cross-subsidy, the all-inclusive pre-tax industrial tariff would be Rs 31.34 per unit — comprising Rs 23.88 per unit variable charge, Rs 4.23 per unit fixed charge, and Rs 3.23 per unit DSS—equivalent to around 11 cents per kWh (at an exchange rate of Rs 280). A further reduction of Rs 6.13 per unit would bring the final tariff down to 9 cents per kWh.
This would require an additional budgetary support of Rs 182 billion per annum —Rs 150 billion for Discos and Rs 32 billion for K-Electric — through fiscalisation of power producers’ debt, with the resulting generation cost relief ring-fenced for industrial consumers.
If approved, this proposal would restore industrial competitiveness, boost production and exports, and drive economic growth. Sources said reducing the final industrial tariff to 9 cents would significantly enhance the global competitiveness of Pakistan’s export-oriented and energy-intensive sectors, encourage reinvestment and expansion, and reduce dependence on captive power generation. Fiscalising legacy power sector debt would separate past inefficiencies from current consumption decisions and strengthen confidence in the policy framework.
A Rs 6.13 per unit tariff reduction is expected to increase industrial consumption by at least 1,624 GWh, raise real GDP by Rs 411 billion, and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 32.5 billion, with a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum.
If the first two proposals are approved, the industrial tariff would be fixed at Rs 25.21 per kWh (9 cents), requiring a total subsidy of Rs 342 billion. However, electricity consumption would increase by 3,047 GWh, real GDP would rise by Rs 771 billion, and additional tax revenue of Rs 61 billion would be generated.
Proposal 3
The third proposal relates to the inclusion of greenfield industries in the Grid Sustainability Package (GSP) 2025. The government has announced the GSP as a subsidy-neutral mechanism to unlock latent demand by offering electricity at the marginal cost of 8 cents per kWh for consumption above a defined baseline.
While the IMF approved the GSP, it did not allow the discounted rate to apply to the entire consumption of greenfield industries. The Power Division has requested that discussions with the IMF be reopened to include greenfield industries in full, in order to ensure grid sustainability, enhance industrial competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth.
The Power Division believes that since the current tariff structure already ensures full recovery of fixed costs through base consumption, extending the GSP rate to the entire load of greenfield data centres, crypto-mining facilities, and copper and aluminium industries would not compromise cost recovery. IMF-approved safeguards — including a 25 percent cap on aggregate incremental consumption, semi-annual reviews, and a termination clause—further mitigate fiscal and system-level risks.
Sources said these greenfield industries, particularly data centres and crypto-mining operations, have significant potential to absorb surplus power, improve system load factors, stabilise grid operations during low-demand periods, and strengthen the financial sustainability of the power sector.
Quantitative analysis using macroeconomic indicators shows that each additional 1 GWh of electricity sales adds Rs 253 million to real GDP. Although aluminium smelting and copper refining are energy-intensive, they generate tradable output and strong local supply chains involving mining, logistics, and exports. While the economic productivity per unit of electricity is lower for data centres and crypto-mining, these sectors still contribute meaningfully to GDP growth and tax revenues.
If approved, this proposal would have a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.

The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata province had been closed since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, but operations to relaunch it had begun on Wednesday after it received the final green light from the nuclear regulator.However, its operator the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said Thursday that “an alarm from the monitoring system… sounded during the reactor startup procedures”, causing it to suspend operations.
“We don’t expect this to be solved within a day or two. There is no telling at the moment how long it will take,” site superintendent Takeyuki Inagaki told a news conference.
“We will for now fully focus on trying to identify the cause of what happened,” he said.The alarm that went off prompted TEPCO to “investigate the malfunctioning electrical equipment,” spokesman Takashi Kobayashi told AFP.
And “once it became clear that it would take time, we decided to reinsert the control rods in a planned manner”, he said, adding that the reactor “is stable and there is no radioactive impact outside”.Control rods are a device used to control the nuclear chain reaction in the reactor core, which can be accelerated by slightly withdrawing them, or slowed down or stopped completely by inserting them deeper.
The restart, initially scheduled for Tuesday, had been pushed back after another technical issue related to the rods’ removal was detected last weekend — a problem that was resolved on Sunday, according to TEPCO.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.
The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.
However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.
Public opinion in Niigata is deeply divided: Around 60 percent of residents oppose the restart, while 37 percent support it, according to a survey conducted in September.
“It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk?

Brent crude was down $1.07 cents, or 1.6%, at $64.17 a barrel at 1123 GMT. West Texas Intermediate for March declined $1.02 cents, or 1.7%, to $59.60 a barrel.
The contracts climbed more than 0.4% on Wednesday following a rise of 1.5% a day earlier, after OPEC+ producer Kazakhstan halted output at its Tengiz and Korolev oilfields due to power distribution issues.
“There is a deflation of risk premium related to the Greenland debacle and Iran supply risk has also been reduced,” said Ole Hansen, chief commodity analyst at Saxo Bank.
On Wednesday, Trump ruled out the use of force to acquire Greenland and stepped back from tariff threats aimed at European allies.
Trump also said he hoped there would be no further U.S. military action in Iran, but added the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear programme.
Against the backdrop of Greenland and the receding prospect of action in Iran, oil prices should hold at around $60 a barrel, said Tony Sycamore, an analyst with online broker IG.
Also Wednesday, Trump said he believed “we’re reasonably close” to a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, adding he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later in the day.
An end to the war would likely result in the removal of U.S. sanctions on Russia, which would limit supply disruptions and weigh down prices.
The International Energy Agency revised its 2026 global oil demand growth forecasts higher on Wednesday in its latest monthly oil market report, suggesting a slightly narrower surplus this year.
U.S. crude and gasoline stocks rose, while distillate inventories fell last week, market sources said on Wednesday, citing figures from the American Petroleum Institute.
Crude stocks rose by 3.04 million barrels in the week ended on January 16, according to the API, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Gasoline inventories rose by 6.21 million barrels, while distillate inventories fell by 33,000 barrels, the sources said.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403239/us-warns-against-eu-tariff-bazooka-over-greenland,US warns against EU tariff ‘bazooka’ over Greenland - Business Recorder,"DAVOS: The US trade envoy on Tuesday warned European nations against using its tariff “bazooka” in response to President Donald Trump’s threat to acquire Greenland, saying it would “not be wise”.
French President Emmanuel Macron in particular has urged use of the EU’s anti-coercion instrument (ACI) after Trump threatened tariffs of up to 25 percent on eight European countries.
“Every country is going to do what’s in their national interests,” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told a small group of journalists at the Davos summit.
“And those have natural consequences,” he said, adding that deploying the ACI “would not be wise” — echoing comments from US Secretary Treasury Scott Bessent at Davos on Monday.
The EU has never deployed the instrument, aimed at dissuading countries from exerting geopolitical pressure on the bloc.
But even as some officials push for talks to de-escalate a crisis that has dominated the Davos summit so far, others are urging the EU to stand up to “blackmail” over the autonomous Danish territory.
Asked about the US response if the EU deems Greenland “non-negotiable”, Greer said “If that’s the case, then so be it.”
“What I’ve found is that when countries follow my advice, they tend to do OK. When they don’t crazy things happen,” he added.
Separately, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told European countries “to keep the pressure and temperature low” with regards to threats of retaliatory tariffs.
If the EU were to impose tariffs that would change the trade deal it struck with Trump’s administration last July, “it wouldn’t change to the benefit of Europe”, Lutnick told a Davos panel.
The deal imposed a US tariff ceiling of 15 percent on most EU goods, while Britain secured a deal that limits tariffs on most goods to 10 percent. More broadly Greer said that under Trump, trading partners should not assume that “the US market is going to be permanently available to everyone all the time, forever.”
“If you don’t periodically review and assess whether your level of openness or closed is appropriate, you’re going to have outcomes that are inconsistent with the policy goals at the moment,” he said.
“So there’s always going to be a little bit of uncertainty.”

He stated that industrial tariffs are currently carrying a cross subsidy burden ranging from Rs 4.5 to Rs 7 per unit, with a total impact of Rs 131 billion, which translates into an additional cost of nearly 20 percent on already expensive electricity. According to him, industry is barely managing to carry its own burden, and this extra cost is pushing many units towards closure or long term contraction.
S M Tanveer pointed out that over the past few years, the number of protected consumers has almost doubled, yet instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal space, the government has chosen the easier route of loading this burden onto industry. He said this policy effectively uses industry as a balancing item for systemic failures, even though industry is the only segment that consistently pays, consumes, and creates employment.
He strongly urged the government and the Minister for Energy Power Division to immediately remove cross subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs and to stop using industry as a substitute for fiscal reform. He stressed that protecting industry is not a concession but an economic necessity.—PR","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:04:00 GMT",,electricity subsidy,The cost of electricity in Pakistan has risen to almost $1.5 billion a year.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403011/aptma-raises-its-concerns-over-current-electricity-pricing-structure,APTMA raises its concerns over current electricity pricing structure - Business Recorder,"LAHORE: All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) has raised serious concerns over the current electricity pricing structure, warning that Pakistan’s industrial base is being pushed toward irreparable decline due to unaffordable energy costs and an unsustainable cross-subsidy mechanism embedded in the national power tariff framework.
Textile exports constituting more than 60 percent of Pakistan’s total export have been drastically declining for the past five consecutive months, with a sharp 8 percent drop recorded in December 2025 alone, underscoring the immediate economic impact of these distortions.
Kamran Arshad Chairman APTMA addressing a largely attended Press Conference at Lahore criticised the government for not passing on to industrial consumers the benefit of a recent reduction in the base electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). He said that Power Division had maintained the industrial base tariff, citing a high number of domestic consumers receiving subsidised rates. Chairman APTMA said that costly electricity had crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector. He said that due to abnormally high power tariff around 150 large textile units have shutdown during the past two years rendering hundreds and thousands of workers jobless.
Kamran urged the government to abolish cross-subsidies imposed on industry and apply regionally competitive energy tariff to enable the local textile industry to compete in the global textile trade. He said that electricity tariffs for large-scale industrial consumers in Pakistan remain significantly higher than those in regional competitive economies, where electricity tariff for industrial usage ranges from ¢5 to 7.5 /kWh. In contrast, the effective tariff for Pakistani industries is more than ¢12/ kWh. This disparity is a core reason for the erosion of Pakistan’s export competitiveness, as the cross subsidy is a hidden tax that cannot be exported.
Kamran said that the centre of the issue is the policy of cross-subsidisation, whereby industrial consumers are compelled to bear the cost of subsidies provided to other consumer categories. Regulatory filings and official disclosures show that the power sector will require a subsidy of Rs629 billion in 2026, while the Federal allocation stands at just Rs248 billion. The shortfall of Rs381 billion is being recovered through cross-subsidisation from industrial and other consumers.
Asad Shafi Chairman APTMA North strongly opposed levy of hidden tax on industry and exports in the name of cross subsidy. He demanded that social subsidies for lifeline and protected consumers must be transparently funded by the state through the federal or provincial budgets. Shifting this financial obligation to the industrial sector undermines manufacturing, exports, employment, and investment at a time when Pakistan’s economy cannot afford further setbacks.
Asad added that the current Time-of-Use (ToU) tariff regime is outdated and misaligned with actual demand patterns. Peak pricing hours no longer correspond with true peak system load, making the framework both economically inefficient and operationally irrational. The elevated peak-hour rates disrupt industrial load planning, raise operational costs, and discourage grid consumption at times when capacity is underutilized. Additionally, it incentivizes a shift toward solar and battery storage systems, further undermining demand for grid-supplied power. He strongly urged for elimination of the peak hours tariff for industrial consumers in favour of a single, flat rate.
Asad said that the industry is already operating under high-cost conditions, with high interest rates, high tax rates, and global economic volatility. The added burden of inflated power tariffs has made many manufacturing operations financially unviable, leading to massive shut down and scaling back of operations.
Other leading textile exporters, speaking on the occasion called for the immediate rationalization of power tariffs by removal of cross-subsidy and aligning of energy tariffs with regionally competitive levels of not more than ¢7.5/ kWh. Doing so will restore export competitiveness, upsurge investments, improve capacity utilization and create millions of jobs. Furthermore, a cost-of-service based tariff regime would enhance electricity demand, improve generation utilization, and further reduce per-unit costs, leading to system-wide efficiency gains.
Meanwhile, SM Tanveer, Leader of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI), has expressed concerns over reliance on remittances and debt-driven consumption, and not exports, for economic growth and development.
He highlighted the challenges facing Pakistan’s exports, citing an estimated USD60 billion gap in potential exports.
In a statement, Tanveer noted that Pakistan’s export share in GDP has declined from 16 percent in the 1990s to 10.4 percent in 2024.
On the contrary, he said, Vietnam’s export-to-GDP ratio is 95 percent. Bangladesh, a country we used to look down on is around 20 percent. Thailand’s at 60 percent.
He identified high production costs, limited market access, low productivity, and inadequate infrastructure as key factors contributing to this issue.
“Pakistan’s exports are facing significant challenges, and it is imperative that we address these issues to unlock the country’s true potential,” Tanveer said. “We need to adopt a market-determined exchange rate, strengthen trade finance, improve logistics and compliance, and enhance trade agreements to boost our exports.”
Tanveer emphasized the need for a comprehensive strategy to promote exports and reduce reliance on imports. “We must work together to create a business-friendly environment, invest in infrastructure, and promote innovation and value addition in our export-oriented sectors,” he added.
The FPCCI leader urged the government to take concrete steps to address the challenges facing Pakistan’s exports and unlocks the country’s potential for growth and development.

Renowned industrialist S M Tanveer, and President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry Atif Ikram Sheikh has issued a warning stating that nearly the entire industrial sector, including textile and spinning, has reached the ventilator and there is an urgent need to impose an economic emergency in the country.
Renowned industrialist Gohar Ejaz has stated that the cross-subsidy on electricity for industries is tantamount to a death warrant.

A mixed trend was observed at Heimtextil, the international home textile exhibition held in Germany. Pakistani trader Muhammad Adil Usawala, present at the exhibition, reported that Pakistani companies are expected to receive reasonable orders.
Meanwhile, a dispute continues over the building of the Karachi Cotton Association, where the Evacuee Property Trust Board has taken control of the Karachi Cotton Exchange building with the assistance of the Federal Investigation Agency since December thirteenth.
The 320 registered cotton brokers and tenants of the Karachi Cotton Association are demanding that their offices be opened and they be allowed to issue daily cotton spot rates, as business is being severely affected due to the closure of spot rates. The closure of business worth millions of rupees conducted daily at the Karachi Cotton Association is causing immense financial losses, while approximately five thousand people have become jobless and unemployed.
During the past week, quality cotton prices in the local cotton market increased by 300 to 500 rupees per maund. Textile and spinning mills are showing interest in purchasing quality cotton. Due to the daily decline in quality cotton stock, ginners are demanding higher rates which had resulted in the recorded price increase. The arrival of raw cotton has virtually stopped, and the business volume remains limited.
On another front, the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), with assistance from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), took possession of the Karachi Cotton Exchange building on December 13 and sealed the entire building. A total of 209 business offices, including those of 320 registered cotton brokers located in the building, have also been sealed. This has brought daily business worth millions of rupees to a standstill. The 320 cotton brokers and other tenants have been left helpless and without support, resulting in approximately 5,000 people becoming unemployed and without work.
Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab has filed a case in the Sindh High Court on behalf of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), claiming that the Karachi Cotton Exchange building is the property of KMC. The Karachi Cotton Exchange has deposited its lease with KMC until 2081. The Sindh High Court has issued a stay order. The 320 cotton brokers and tenants state that this is a mutual dispute between KMC, ETPB, and the Karachi Cotton Association, but they question why the cotton brokers’ offices have been sealed.
The Home Textile Exhibition held in Frankfurt, Germany, witnessed participation from approximately 3,000 companies representing 66 countries. Attendance on the second day of the exhibition showed improvement compared to the first day, indicating growing interest among industry stakeholders.
A significant number of Pakistani home textile producers participated in the exhibition as exhibitors. The Pakistani contingent included prominent manufacturers such as Gul Ahmed Textile, Feroze 1888, Younus Textile, Zaman Textile, Alkaram Towel, Naveena Exports, Liberty, Orient, Fashion Net, Mustaqeem, Meco, Fazal Cloth, Fazal Cotton, Kohinoor, Nishat Group, Alkaram, and several other established institutions from the country’s textile sector.
The robust attendance observed on the second day has generated optimism among industry participants. There are expectations that Pakistan will secure substantial orders from international buyers, which would provide positive support to the Pakistani economy during these times.
In domestic market developments, cotton prices in Punjab and Sindh provinces have experienced an increase ranging from 300 to 500 rupees per maund, depending on quality and payment conditions. Current rates are now running between 14,500 to 16,900 rupees per maund across these regions.
Meanwhile, prices for cottonseed, cottonseed cake, and cottonseed oil have remained stable in the market.
Karachi Cotton Brokers Forum Chairman Naseem Usman has reported that international cotton prices showed a mixed trend. The New York cotton futures price is currently trading between 65 to 68 American cents per pound.
Meanwhile, textile exports are continuously declining, which is a serious issue, according to the APTMA Chairman. Kamran Arshad, Chairman of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, has stated that textile exports are continuously declining, and this is a serious problem that poses a threat to Pakistan’s industry, economy, and employment.
While addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the Chairman of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association said that textile exports have been decreasing from October to December, with textile exports falling by 8.55 percent in December alone.
He mentioned that the textile industry accounts for a 60 percent share in the country’s exports. The tariff for domestic industries has reached 34 rupees, and industries cannot operate under this tariff regime. The burden of other consumers is being placed on the industries, and the burden of cross subsidy is being imposed on the industrial sector.
The chairman stated that the load factor of power plants that are operational should be examined, while charges are also being collected for power plants that are not even running.
Furthermore, former federal minister for Commerce and Patron-in-Chief of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA), Dr Gohar Ejaz, has warned the government in unequivocal terms that Pakistan’s industrial sector has reached the brink of a severe crisis, as the escalating costs of electricity and gas continue to undermine the competitiveness of Pakistani products in international markets. He stated that Pakistan is rapidly losing its export orders to regional competitor countries where electricity rates average around 9 US cents per unit, whereas Pakistani industry has to pay 12 cents or more. He emphasised that no exporter can operate with such structural weakness, noting that success or failure in the global market today is determined by energy costs, and unfortunately Pakistan is losing this battle.
Meanwhile, according to informed sources, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) is holding a meeting with business leaders today (Thursday), where concerns regarding taxes as high as 60 percent, poor governance, and excessive energy costs will reportedly be heard.
Additionally, the Pakistan Textile Council has written to the government demanding the elimination of the 160 billion rupees electricity cross-subsidy and surcharge. The council argues that unnecessary additional electricity charges on the industry have significantly increased production costs, thereby weakening exports and affecting the country’s export competitiveness.
The industry also objects that factories required to operate in three shifts are paying more expensive electricity due to the Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff structure. The council has expressed concern that if immediate action is not taken, exports will decline further and losses in the textile sector will increase. The entire textile industry is linked to cotton production.

The announcement was made by Rovshan Najaf, President of SOCAR, during his engagement with the Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, read a statement released by the Finance Division.
Najaf stated that SOCAR views Pakistan as a natural long-term energy partner, citing the country’s market depth, growing energy demand, and ongoing reform momentum in the oil and gas sector.
Najaf highlighted SOCAR’s existing commercial engagement in Pakistan through SOCAR Trading, which operates under a G2G LNG framework with Pakistan LNG Limited, providing Pakistan with flexible LNG supply arrangements.
Under this framework, SOCAR can supply up to one LNG cargo per month without take-or-pay obligations, offering enhanced price and demand flexibility. The LNG arrangement has been extended into 2025, reflecting continued cooperation between the two sides.
He further noted SOCAR’s ongoing engagement with Pakistan State Oil (PSO) on petroleum product supply and expressed interest in expanding cooperation across the broader oil and gas value chain as Pakistan continues to implement energy-sector reforms.
Najaf outlined SOCAR’s global profile as a major state-owned energy company operating in over 20 countries, with a workforce exceeding 66,000 employees, revenues of approximately $50.6 billion (2024), and an estimated net worth of $56.75 billion (2025).
He emphasised SOCAR’s experience as a peer national energy company from an emerging economy, positioning it as a credible long-term partner for Pakistan’s energy sector.
Welcoming SOCAR’s planned investment, Aurangzeb reiterated the Government of Pakistan’s commitment to attracting strategic and commercially viable investment in the oil and gas and mining sectors, describing these areas as central to Pakistan’s energy security and industrial growth.
He noted that ongoing reforms are focused on improving pricing transparency, contractual clarity, and risk-sharing mechanisms to support sustained private-sector participation.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403377/regulatory-independence,Regulatory independence - Business Recorder,"Independent regulation is not a technical formality; it is the foundation of a credible and functional power sector. This is why the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority was created as an autonomous regulator, operating at arm’s length from the executive. Its purpose was to ensure that tariff determination and regulatory decisions are based on law, technical analysis, and transparency, rather than short-term administrative or fiscal pressures.
The recent proposed amendments to the power sector laws, which shift key approval and notification powers from the federal government to the Power Division, risk undermining this institutional design.
While framed as procedural adjustments, their practical effect is a concentration of regulatory influence within the bureaucracy. This represents a move away from rule-based regulation toward administrative discretion, which is neither healthy nor sustainable for a sector as complex and capital intensive as power.
Historically, tariff notification under Section 31 involved federal government oversight, which implied collective responsibility and an additional layer of accountability. Replacing this framework with authority vested in the “division concerned” raises legitimate questions about concentration of power and transparency. Regulatory decisions require insulation from departmental priorities, particularly where those priorities are shaped by subsidy management and short-term fiscal constraints.
It is important to state clearly that this concern is not political in nature. It’s all about the core function of Nepra, consumer and sector protection. The current political leadership has made sincere efforts to rationalize costs in the power sector, and whatever tariff relief has been achieved in recent months has largely been driven by ministerial intent. Those efforts deserve acknowledgment.
However, despite these initiatives, government departments have still been unable to deliver electricity to industry at competitive levels. The continued inability to move toward tariffs around 9 cents per unit remains a serious concern for industrial sustainability and export competitiveness.
This gap between intent and outcome highlights a deeper institutional issue. Power Division departments appear increasingly focused on managing subsidies and fiscal exposure, often through decisions that shift costs rather than eliminate inefficiencies which often comes as an additional and social cost on industrial tariff. While fiscal pressures are real, they cannot justify weakening the regulator.
An independent regulator exists precisely to balance cost recovery, efficiency, consumer protection, and long- term sector health, even when such decisions are administratively uncomfortable.
If there is concern that regulatory decisions require closer scrutiny or improved consistency, the solution does not lie in curtailing regulatory independence.
The appropriate response is to strengthen oversight, not control. A neutral and professional regulatory oversight board can be established to review regulatory performance, track outcomes, and ensure accountability without interfering in decision making authority.
Such a mechanism would restore checks and balances while preserving institutional credibility. It would allow policymakers to evaluate whether regulatory decisions are delivering intended outcomes, while maintaining a clear separation between policy formulation, regulation, and execution. This separation is essential for investor confidence, consumer trust, and long-term stability of the power sector.
The recent proposed amendments risk weakening what remains of regulatory independence at a time when the sector requires stronger institutions, not centralized discretion. Sustainable reform demands respect for institutional roles, transparent oversight, and clear boundaries.
Undermining the regulator may offer short-term administrative comfort, but it carries long-term costs that the power sector and the broader economy can ill afford.

Talking to state media from Davos, he is attending the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting (WEF), Aurangzeb said that he met with his Saudi Arabian and UAE counterparts, describing both countries as long-standing partners of Pakistan.

“The recent PIA privatisation has ticked a lot of boxes, as participation by two large local conglomerates has sent a strong signal to the international investment community,” he said.
Last month, a consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited (AHCL) emerged as the winning bidder for the acquisition of a 75% stake in PIA, submitting a top bid of Rs135 billion, which was well above the government’s initial minimum price of Rs100 billion and the base price of Rs115 billion, at which the auction began.

Aurangzeb stated that the government’s current engagement strategy at the WEF focuses on strengthening confidence among existing investors across Pakistan’s major economic sectors, alongside outreach to potential new investors.
