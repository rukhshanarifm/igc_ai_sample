https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402591,Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report - Business Recorder,"Weak performance by Pakistan’s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country’s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.
The report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with “rigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)” to reduce tariffs were a milestone.
However, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.
“Overall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,” the report read.

The regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the “old era of scarcity is ending”, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might “prove to be even more complex”.
Operational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.
In its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.
Meanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the ‘Take or Pay’ electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.
NEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.
“A significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan’s power system.”
The regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.
“It remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.”
On the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.

At the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.
“Governance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan’s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,” the NEPRA report said.
KE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.
In contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.
QESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.

In the first full fiscal year of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government, SOEs slid deeper into financial distress, with their cumulative net losses surging by nearly 300 percent, soaring from Rs30.6 billion in FY2023-24 to a massive Rs122.9 billion in FY2024-25. These numbers, presented by the finance ministry at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises last week, expose a widening gap between promise and performance.A closer reading of the data deepens this disquiet. The combined revenues of SOEs fell over 10 percent to Rs12.4 trillion in FY2024-25, while even among profitable enterprises, earnings lost momentum, with aggregate profits sliding 13 percent from the previous year to end at Rs710 billion.
READ MORE:ADB approves $540mn financing to advance SOE reforms, coastal resilience in Pakistan
Loss-making SOEs offered little comfort, with their combined losses easing by a negligible two percent, a change too small to signal any meaningful turnaround. Worse still, SOEs also drew a massive Rs2.1 trillion in annual fiscal support, underscoring how public resources continue to be funneled into chronic inefficiency rather than productive growth. These fiscal flows were driven largely by higher equity injections to address the circular debt build-up, making it patently clear that public funds are being used to manage distress, and not to resolve the structural failures that continue to drag SOEs and the wider economy down.
While the finance ministry attributes the decline in SOE revenues primarily to falling international oil prices, which compressed margins in the oil sector, this factor can only explain a small part of the slowdown, and cannot account for the sheer magnitude of the losses now weighing on the public balance sheet. These losses, it must be noted, are not broadly spread but heavily concentrated in a small cluster of entities, most notably the National Highway Authority and several power distribution companies (DISCOs). This is hardly a new development. These entities have long been mired in inefficiency and chronic red ink, underscoring that the losses in FY2024-25 reflect deep-seated structural failures rather than temporary market fluctuations. Nowhere is this more evident than in DISCOs, which have come to embody the power sector’s systemic decay: a crumbling transmission and distribution (T&D) network haemorrhaging revenue through electricity theft, excessive line losses and chronic mis-governance. High depreciation and financing costs compound the problem, as an ageing T&D infrastructure inflates balance sheets without generating commensurate revenue, while repeated borrowing to bridge cash shortfalls and service circular debt accumulates interest expenses, locking these entities into a self-perpetuating cycle of financial stress.
Even when it comes to profit-making SOEs, the system’s limits are apparent, as their returns often rely on guaranteed government contracts, leaving open the question of whether they could survive under genuine open market competition. The need for a bold, wide-ranging reform agenda for SOEs, then, remains urgent, yet progress on the ground has been painfully slow.
Efforts so far have been piecemeal, lacking coherence, and often driven more by pressure from international lenders than by a genuine commitment to restructuring loss-making entities. Meaningful change would require comprehensive sectoral reorganisation, greater deregulation to foster competition and the establishment of robust corporate governance frameworks to tackle inefficiencies, while strengthening transparency and accountability.
What we’ve had on our hands instead is political inertia and bureaucratic resistance. This has meant that for an administration that has repeatedly promised sweeping SOE reform, plans remain largely on paper, execution is patchy at best and the cost of delay keeps mounting.
The government must recognise that without decisive action on SOE governance, accountability and privatisation, the reform narrative will remain meaningless while the financial haemorrhage continues unabated.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402666,Power sector: Nepra sees ‘limited’ progress despite fixes - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: An assessment of Pakistan’s power sector during FY 2024-25 prompted National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to observe that despite several structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remains limited and insufficient to inspire confidence in the sector’s ability to support sustained industrial growth or provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential segments.
In its State of the Industry Report 2024-25, NEPRA stated that the power sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain efficiency and undermine its contribution to economic development.
The regulator emphasized that power sector entities must operate under commercially binding agreements that clearly define roles, performance standards, and accountability mechanisms.

Each entity should bear the financial consequences of its inefficiencies rather than passing these costs on to consumers, who are currently burdened with approximately Rs233 billion in Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)—a cost arising not from normal business operations but from inefficiencies within certain sector entities.
According to the report, generation capacity under “Take or Pay” contracts remains significantly underutilized, resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants. Simultaneously, the transmission network is both constrained and underutilized, contributing to higher transmission tariffs and preventing the dispatch of cheaper and more efficient electricity in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, several government-owned DISCOs continue to suffer from poor governance, with transmission and distribution (T&D) losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery, and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. These inefficiencies further exacerbate asset underutilisation across generation, transmission, and distribution, while fueling the circular debt problem.
Nepra noted that challenges faced by power sector entities—largely government-owned—span planning, execution, and operational domains.
Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered financial sustainability and limited the sector’s contribution to economic growth. Weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management further constrain the sector’s ability to provide reliable and affordable electricity.
During FY 2024-25, efforts were made to reduce “Take or Pay” generation capacity through the retirement or decommissioning of inefficient power plants with consistently low utilisation. As a result, 2,829 MW of capacity was retired, decommissioned, or had its Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) terminated.
Consequently, effective operational generation capacity declined to 41,121 MW as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888 MW a year earlier. However, 884 MW of new hydropower capacity—Suki Kinari Hydropower Project—was added during the year.
The utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the CPPA-G system remained 38.82%. NEPRA highlighted that generation costs account for nearly 82% of the electricity tariff. During FY 2024-25, the actual per-unit Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) stood at Rs14.21/kWh, the highest component of the electricity tariff, primarily due to underutilisation of “Take or Pay” plants.
During the year, several power plants approached NEPRA through CPPA-G seeking reductions in generation tariffs. Approval of these adjustments is expected to yield long-term benefits by lowering generation costs, improving tariff efficiency, and stabilizing consumer prices, while also supporting investor confidence through a predictable regulatory environment.
However, NEPRA noted that persistent inefficiencies in public sector power plants — such as the 747 MW Guddu Power Plant, 969 MW Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, and several WAPDA-operated hydro plants—are undermining tariff reduction efforts. These inefficiencies result in lower utilisation, higher costs, and reduced system efficiency, offsetting gains from IPP tariff reductions and plant retirements.
The Part Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) added Rs46.388 billion to generation costs in FY 2024-25, compared to Rs55.671 billion in 2023-24, and, while unavoidable, these costs can be significantly reduced through effective demand-side management.
Similarly, Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) costs declined to Rs13.285 billion, from Rs39.521 billion, though NEPRA said further reductions are possible through better grid management.
Lower utilisation of Thar coal-based power plants, which operated at 67.23% utilisation, also raised generation costs by inflating both CPP and Energy Purchase Price (EPP). Delays in ensuring regular coal supply to Lucky Electric Power Company further exacerbated inefficiencies.
Nepra observed widespread underutilisation of transmission assets, including the 4,000 MW Matiari–Lahore HVDC line, which operated at just 35% utilisation despite payments based on full availability. Manual system logs further hinder accurate assessment of transmission performance.
The poor performance of the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) has led to violations of the economic merit order, increased generation costs, project delays, and cost overruns. Delays in key projects—including KE-NGC interconnection, Lahore North Grid, and SCADA-III—have adversely affected system reliability and finances.
Governance remains the most critical issue confronting DISCOs. KE, PESCO, HESCO, SEPCO, and QESCO were identified as the poorest performers, with excessive losses, low recovery, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Except for TESCO, no DISCO met Nepra-approved T&D loss targets.
Weak DISCO performance contributed approximately Rs397 billion to circular debt during the year. Nepra termed load-shedding based on AT&C losses unlawful and inequitable, as it penalizes compliant consumers and deepens sector inefficiencies.
Rising electricity costs and poor service have pushed consumers—particularly affluent ones—towards rooftop solar PV systems and battery storage, reducing grid demand during non-solar hours.
Nepra also expressed concern over the underperformance of the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO), citing limited adoption of modern technologies and the absence of a fully functional SCADA system.
The regulator concluded that Pakistan’s power sector transformation remains incomplete without full implementation of the 1992 WAPDA Restructuring Plan, emphasizing corporatization, decentralization, privatization, and separation of policy, regulation, and operations. Continued centralized control, overlapping mandates, and weak accountability, it warned, will perpetuate inefficiencies and impose unnecessary financial burdens on the economy.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402667/ke-consumers-also-paying-rs323kwh-dss-nepra,KE consumers also paying Rs3.23/kWh DSS: Nepra - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: While acknowledging that K-Electric has no role in the accumulation of circular debt, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has noted that KE consumers are nonetheless paying a Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per kWh, highlighting the inequitable burden of sector inefficiencies on electricity users.
Nepra stated that despite determining consumer-end tariffs in a manner that fully covers the revenue requirements of all entities across the power supply chain, persistent structural inefficiencies and the historical poor performance of distribution companies (Discos) leave little reason to expect that circular debt can be sustainably controlled.
The regulator explained that if NEPRA-determined tariffs were fully implemented and all sector entities met prescribed performance targets, each entity’s financial obligations would be met and circular debt would not arise.
READ MORE:Govt wants to alter KE consumer-end tariff as per Nepra fixation
However, in practice, several power sector entities fail to achieve these targets due to weak governance, poor recovery performance, and high technical and commercial losses, resulting in insufficient revenue collection and the continued accumulation of circular debt.
As of June 30, 2025, circular debt in Pakistan’s power sector stood at approximately Rs1.614 trillion, compared to Rs2.393 trillion a year earlier, reflecting a reduction of around Rs780 billion. Nepra noted, however, that this decline does not represent a structural improvement and mirrors similar short-term reductions seen in the past.
According to Nepra, both current and previous declines in circular debt primarily resulted from external financial injections rather than from meaningful sector reforms. During FY 2024-25, DISCO inefficiencies contributed approximately Rs265 billion through excessive T&D losses and Rs132 billion due to low recovery ratios. Despite these shortcomings, the overall circular debt figure declined during the year.
Nepra attributed this reduction to the Government of Pakistan securing commercial financing to retire liabilities of Power Holding (Private) Limited (PHPL) and clear arrears owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). While this intervention temporarily lowered circular debt, it failed to address the sector’s underlying inefficiencies.
To service the cost of this borrowing, most electricity consumers — excluding a few protected domestic categories—are now required to pay an additional Rs3.23 per kWh under the Debt Servicing Surcharge for several years. Nepra noted that this surcharge effectively transfers the burden of sector inefficiencies to consumers and represents one of the largest components of the end-user tariff, after the Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) and Energy Purchase Price (EPP).
Nepra further stated that KE, the country’s only private-sector distribution company, does not contribute to circular debt, as it absorbs the financial impact of higher losses and lower recoveries instead of passing these costs on to consumers. Despite this, KE consumers remain subject to the DSS. To date, KE has collected and remitted Rs35.76 billion under the DSS to the Government of Pakistan and CPPA-G.
The regulator observed that had public-sector Discos been privatized in line with the 1992 power sector reform strategy, trillions of rupees in losses could have been avoided, and consumers would have benefited from improved service quality. Nepra added that although challenges to privatization persist even after more than two decades, these hurdles can be overcome through well-designed strategies and firm political commitment.
Given the prevailing structural inefficiencies and the historical performance of Discos, Nepra concluded that there is little justification to expect sustainable control of circular debt or lasting improvements in the power sector under the existing framework.

Nepra data shows that KE has recorded a sustained decline in transmission and distribution losses since its privatization in 2005, when losses were reported at around 40 percent. By FY 2024-25, KE’s losses had fallen to below 15 percent, a level that remains above ideal benchmarks but is significantly lower than those observed across several public-sector Discos. The regulator attributed this long-term reduction to improved governance mechanisms and greater operational accountability following privatization.
In its assessment of recovery performance, Nepra observed that KE absorbed the impact of recovery shortfalls internally rather than transferring the burden to the power supply chain. While KE consumers continued to pay the federally imposed Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS), under which Rs. 35.76 billion was collected during the year, the utility itself did not add to sector-wide payment arrears, distinguishing its financial treatment from that of government-owned Discos.
Referring to broader sector reforms, Nepra noted that KE’s post-privatization experience illustrates the potential benefits of reduced government control, including greater financial discipline and operational responsiveness. However, the regulator cautioned that KE’s performance should be viewed as part of a wider reform discussion rather than an isolated solution, emphasising that comprehensive structural changes across all distribution companies would be required to achieve sustainable sector-wide improvement.

Section 3(a) empowers the Authority to determine tariffs, rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services by generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and to recommend these to the relevant division for notification.
Under the revised Section 31(7), notification of NEPRA-approved tariffs or uniform tariffs—along with rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services—shall be made in the official Gazette by the division concerned within 30 days of intimation by the Authority. If the division fails to notify the tariff or refer the matter back to NEPRA for reconsideration within the specified time, the Authority may direct immediate application of its approved tariff through notification, subject to any subsequent adjustments arising from reconsideration requested by the division.
Section 31(7)(i) provides that the division concerned may, within 30 days of receiving NEPRA’s intimation regarding approved tariffs of public-sector distribution and supply licensees, require the Authority to reconsider its determination on issues common to these licensees. NEPRA would then be required to complete the reconsideration within 30 days and inform the division accordingly.
Under Section 31(7)(ii), NEPRA may make quarterly tariff adjustments within 15 days on account of capacity and transmission charges, transmission and distribution losses, variable operation and maintenance costs, and policy guidelines issued by the division concerned. The adjusted tariff would be intimated to the division prior to Gazette notification. The division may seek reconsideration within 15 days, failing which NEPRA shall notify the adjusted tariff in the official Gazette. If reconsideration is sought, NEPRA must decide the matter within 15 days and intimate the division before notification.
Section 31(7)(iii) allows the division concerned, in lieu of seeking reconsideration, to file an appeal.

The industrial sector on Monday strongly opposed a cross-subsidy of nearly Rs130 billion imposed on industrial and export-oriented consumers, warning that the burden has rendered industrial growth and exports unfeasible.
Industry representatives expressed these concerns during a public hearing on the Federal Government’s motion for the determination of a uniform electricity tariff for the Current Year (CY) 2026, following recent tariff determinations by Nepra, which proposed a reduction of 61 paisa per kWh for CY 2026.
READ MORE:Nepra reduces national average tariff
NEPRA determined the tariffs of distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26. These determinations were forwarded to the Federal Government for filing a uniform tariff application in accordance with the NEPRA Act. Section 31(4) of the Act requires NEPRA, on the basis of a uniform tariff application, to determine a uniform tariff for public-sector licensees engaged in power supply, in the consumer’s interest, based on consolidated accounts.
Subsequently, the Power Division filed a motion for determination of the uniform tariff based on the consolidated revenue requirement of DISCOs. In line with the National Electricity Policy, the uniform tariff will also apply to K-Electric (KE) consumers.
Accordingly, NEPRA was requested to issue a revised Schedule of Tariff (SoT) for KE consumers, to be notified from January 1, 2026.
The hearing officiated by Chairman NEPRA, Waseem Mukhtar (Zoom, Member (Development) Maqsood Anwar Khan (Zoom) and Member (Law) Amina Ahmed.
A Power Division team, led by Additional Secretary (Power Finance) Mehfooz Bhatti and Naveed Qaiser, gave a comprehensive presentation covering power-sector issues related to tariffs, revenue requirements, future generation forecasts, and the impact of solarisation, including net metering and off-grid solutions.
Industry representatives disclosed that recent consultations with the government revealed cross-subsidies of Rs131 billion within DISCOs, while total cross-subsidies in KE’s jurisdiction amount to approximately Rs160 billion. This means industrial consumers are effectively paying up to Rs7 per kWh in cross-subsidy.
Referring to the textile spinning sector, participants highlighted that the number of spindles in Pakistan has fallen from 10.25 million to nearly half. In contrast, China has installed more than 35 million spindles in Xinjiang province—its poorest region—and is adding another 15 million spindles.
The Chinese government provides electricity at around 5 cents per kWh, enabling rapid industrial expansion and job creation. Electricity tariffs in other parts of China range between 7 to 8 cents per kWh.
In comparison, Pakistan’s industrial electricity tariff stands at 12.9 cents per kWh, making exports uncompetitive. Chinese textile products, including yarn and fabric, are already flooding Pakistani markets.
“If the industry is relieved of cross-subsidy, the tariff would be around 9 cents per kWh, which could make exports viable. However, this option is being denied solely due to cross-subsidy,” a representative said.
Industry leaders noted that domestic consumers have reduced their monthly electricity consumption to below 200 units to remain eligible for subsidies by installing small solar plants.
Aamir Sheikh stated that neither industry nor exports can survive under current tariffs, adding that the cross-subsidy mechanism must be eliminated entirely. “The solution to Pakistan’s economic problems lies in industrial job creation, not in forcing industry to subsidise the domestic sector,” he said.
Industry representatives also pointed out that industrial consumers pay an additional Rs3.23 per unit as Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)—another form of cross-subsidy—despite having no role in the creation of circular debt. They noted that 10,000 people enter the job market daily, requiring the same number of new jobs to prevent social instability.
“Industry pays around Rs35 per kWh against an actual cost of Rs29 per kWh, with full bill recovery and negligible line losses. The entire DSS is effectively a cross-subsidy,” Aamir Sheikh maintained.
Arif Bilwani urged the government and NEPRA to abolish peak and off-peak tariff structures to ensure industrial survival.
All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) emphasized that removing the cross-subsidy burden from B3 and B4 consumers would generate economy-wide benefits. Aligning tariffs for large-scale manufacturing with regional benchmarks of around 9 cents per kWh would restore competitiveness, boost exports, attract investment, and create jobs. Increased electricity demand would also improve capacity utilization, reduce per-unit costs, and lower tariffs across all consumer categories.
Rehan Javed proposed several recommendations: (i) transparent disclosure of cross-subsidies embedded in industrial tariffs; (ii) a time-bound plan for eliminating industrial cross-subsidies; (iii) provision of any remaining support through explicit, targeted budget subsidies instead of embedded tariffs; and (iv) ensuring that industrial off-peak consumption is not treated as the primary subsidy pool.
He also urged NEPRA to apply voltage-wise allowed loss factors, differentiate distribution margins by voltage, and notify a defined high-voltage cost-of-service adjustment for B-category consumers.
Responding to industry concerns, Naveed Qaiser said the government remains in continuous consultation with stakeholders to reduce industrial tariffs. He noted that industrial cross-subsidies have been reduced from Rs225 billion to Rs102 billion, equivalent to a reduction of Rs5.13 per kWh.
Overall industrial tariffs have fallen from Rs62.33 per kWh in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per kWh, a reduction of Rs16.68 per kWh (26 per cent).
The Power Division informed the Authority that Pakistan’s current installed power generation capacity stands at 58,013 MW, including 9,590 MW from government-owned power plants, 2,007 MW from hydel IPPs, 11,547 MW from thermal IPPs, and 2,795 MW from renewable IPPs.
Power available on the National Grid Company system is 36,397 MW, while KE’s generation capacity is 2,647 MW. Net metering contributes 6,340 MW, and off-grid solar stands at 12,629 MW.
Under the new Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), installed capacity is projected to reach 87,209 MW by 2035, with 90 per cent clean energy, 10 per cent fossil fuel, 96 per cent local resources, and 4 per cent imported fuel.
Pakistan’s power import bill, which rose from $1.9 billion in 2018 to $2.4 billion, is projected to decline to $0.3 billion by 2035.
On solarisation, the Power Division reported that electricity sales declined from 113 billion units in 2023 and are expected to fall to 101 billion units by 2026, largely due to increased solar adoption. This has created a financial burden of approximately Rs3.5 per kWh on DISCO consumers who continue to pay electricity bills.
For FY 2026, 116.40 billion units were received, while 113.58 billion units are expected in CY 2026. Electricity sales stood at 103.56 billion units in FY 2026 and are projected at 101.23 billion units in CY 2026. Transmission and distribution losses are expected to decline from 11.04 per cent to 10.87 per cent.
Energy charges are projected to decrease by Rs1.74 per kWh, capacity charges to increase by Rs0.50 per kWh, Use of System Charges by Rs0.51 per kWh, and distribution margins by Rs0.26 per kWh.
Prior year adjustments will rise by Rs0.14 per kWh, while revenue requirements will decline by Rs0.33 per kWh and working capital by Rs0.29 per kWh. Overall, the Net Revenue Requirement is expected to fall by Rs0.61 per kWh during CY 2026.
Naveed Qaiser further stated that power sector circular debt which stood at Rs 1.6 trillion on June 30, 2025 will remain the same as seasonal variation of Rs 79 billion will be offset.

Industry representatives expressed these concerns during a public hearing on the federal government’s motion for the determination of a uniform electricity tariff for the Current Year (CY) 2026, following recent tariff determinations by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), which proposed a reduction of 61 paisa per kWh for CY 2026.
The Nepra determined the tariffs of distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs 33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs 34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26. These determinations were forwarded to the federal government for filing a uniform tariff application in accordance with the Nepra Act. Section 31(4) of the Act requires Nepra, on the basis of a uniform tariff application, to determine a uniform tariff for public-sector licencees engaged in power supply, in the consumer’s interest, based on consolidated accounts.
Subsequently, the Power Division filed a motion for determination of the uniform tariff based on the consolidated revenue requirement of Discos. In line with the National Electricity Policy, the uniform tariff will also apply to K-Electric (KE) consumers. Accordingly, the Nepra was requested to issue a revised Schedule of Tariff (SoT) for KE consumers, to be notified from January 1, 2026.
The hearing officiated by Chairman Nepra, Waseem Mukhtar (Zoom, Member (Development) Maqsood Anwar Khan (Zoom) and Member (Law) Amina Ahmed.
A Power Division team, led by Additional Secretary (Power Finance) Mehfooz Bhatti and Naveed Qaiser, gave a comprehensive presentation covering power-sector issues related to tariffs, revenue requirements, future generation forecasts, and the impact of solarisation, including net metering and off-grid solutions.
Industry representatives disclosed that recent consultations with the government revealed cross-subsidies of Rs 131 billion within Discos, while total cross-subsidies in KE’s jurisdiction amount to approximately Rs 160 billion. This means industrial consumers are effectively paying up to Rs 7 per kWh in cross-subsidy.
Referring to the textile spinning sector, participants highlighted that the number of spindles in Pakistan has fallen from 10.25 million to nearly half. In contrast, China has installed more than 3 million spindles in Xinjiang province — its poorest region — and is adding another 1.5 million spindles. The Chinese government provides electricity at around 5 cents per kWh, enabling rapid industrial expansion and job creation. Electricity tariffs in other parts of China range between 7 to 8 cents per kWh.
In comparison, Pakistan’s industrial electricity tariff stands at 12.9 cents per kWh, making exports uncompetitive. Chinese textile products, including yarn and fabric, are already flooding Pakistani markets.
“If the industry is relieved of cross-subsidy, the tariff would be around 9 cents per kWh, which could make exports viable. However, this option is being denied solely due to cross-subsidy,” a representative said.
Industry leaders noted that domestic consumers have reduced their monthly electricity consumption to below 200 units to remain eligible for subsidies by installing small solar plants.
Aamir Sheikh stated that neither industry nor exports can survive under current tariffs, adding that the cross-subsidy mechanism must be eliminated entirely. “The solution to Pakistan’s economic problems lies in industrial job creation, not in forcing industry to subsidise the domestic sector,” he said.
Industry representatives also pointed out that industrial consumers pay an additional Rs 3.23 per unit as Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) — another form of cross-subsidy — despite having no role in the creation of circular debt. They noted that 10,000 people enter the job market daily, requiring the same number of new jobs to prevent social instability.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40401830/opinion-the-positive-scenario-by-imf,OPINION: The positive scenario by IMF - Business Recorder,"The IMF Second Review Staff Mission Report contains a set of positive macroeconomic projections of Pakistan from 2025-26 to 2029-30. These five-year projections are considered as feasible and achievable with the appropriate set of policies and reforms.
The objective of this article is to describe the key aspects of these projections and their likelihood, given the outlook over the five years.
The projections postulate the achievement simultaneously of growth and stability as follows:
(i) The GDP growth rate is expected to accelerate at a moderate pace from 2.7 percent in 2024-25 to 3.2 percent in 2025-26, 4.1 percent in 2026-27, 4.5 percent in 2027-28, and stay thereafter at 4.5 percent. It is surprising, however, that the IMF does not expect a growth rate of 5 percent by the fifth year.
(ii) Despite the significantly rising GDP growth rate, the rate of inflation is expected to remain moderate and single-digit. It is projected to rise from only 4.5 percent in 2024-25 to 6.3 percent in 2025-26 and to 7 percent in 2026-27. Thereafter, it is expected to remain constant at 6.5 percent. Therefore, the ‘Philip’s Curve’ will not operate in Pakistan, whereby higher GDP growth rate is accompanied by demand-pull pressures which lead to more inflation.
(iii) Pakistan external vulnerability will simultaneously be reduced substantially. The current account deficit in the balance of payments will remain below or at 1 percent of the GDP over the next five years. It will rise somewhat from a deficit of 0.6 percent of the GDP in 2025-26 to 1.0 percent of the GDP in 2029-30.
There will be increasing net inflows into the financial account of the balance of payments, from USD 2.5 billion in 2024-25, to USD 3.8 billion in 2025-26, to USD 5.9 billion in by 2026-27 and approach USD 10 billion by 2029-30.
The result is likely to be exponential growth in foreign exchange reserves. From USD 14.5 billion in 2024-25, they are projected to rise to USD 17.8 billion in 2025-26 and to USD 23.3 billion in 2026-27. Therefore, Pakistan will have attained the safe reserves cover of over three months by the end of the present IMF programme. As such, there will be no need to go into another Programme.
The task is to determine the combination of exogenous factors, policies and reforms, which will remove the trade-off between stabilization and growth. As highlighted above, over the next five years IMF expects to see acceleration in GDP growth, continuation of moderate inflation and strengthening of Pakistan’s external position, with relatively high foreign exchange reserves.
The global environment is characterized by the terms of trade that Pakistan is likely to face in coming years. From a worsening by 10.5 percent in 2024-25, they are projected by the IMF to improve by 2.7 percent in 2025-26 and by 1.7 percent in 2026-27. Thereafter, they are likely to remain, more or less, unchanged for Pakistan. Also, remittances are projected to increase by USD 5 billion by 2029-30, above the higher level of USD 38 billion attained in 2024-25. These trends will facilitate control over the size of the current account deficit.
The rising level of fixed investment projected by the IMF is based on the assumption; first, that there will continue to be political stability in Pakistan. Second, that the country will face no major natural disasters, like the floods of 2022-23 and 2024-25. Third, there will no escalation in conflicts across the borders and terrorism will be brought increasingly under control. Consequently, the level of fixed investment is expected to rise significantly from 12 percent to 14 percent of the GDP in five years.
The macroeconomic projections have also to be achieved on basis of the magnitudes chosen of the policy variables impacting on growth and stabilization. The IMF has indicated the following:
(i) The rupee is expected to depreciate by 5.9 percent in 2025-26, 6.3 percent in 2026-27, 4.5 percent annually from 2027-28 to 2029-30.
(ii) The nominal policy rate is expected to fall by 1 percent point in 2025-26 and 2026-27. Thereafter, the fall is expected annually of 0.5 percent point.
(iii) The overall tax-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase from 12.3 percent in 2024-25 to 13.3 percent of the GDP and to 13.7 percent of the GDP in 2026-27. Thereafter, it is expected to remain constant at 13.9 percent of the GDP.
(iv) Perhaps surprisingly, the level of development spending is expected to remain constant at close to 2.5 percent of the GDP. It appears that IMF does not indicate the need for a larger and faster expansion of infrastructure to facilitate the process of growth.
What are the consequences of a favorable external environment of global trade and domestic stability, along with the intensity and range of policies described above?
We first look at the impact on the public finances. The overall budget deficit is expected to be curtailed substantially over the next five years, from 5.4 percent of the GDP n 2024-25 to only 2.8 percent of the GDP by 2029-30. Bulk of this decline is anticipated from containment of expenditure, from 21.2 percent of the GDP in 2024-25 to 18.7 percent of the GDP in 2029-30.
The level of revenues is expected to remain, more or less, unchanged at close to 16 percent of the GDP. Tax revenues will increasingly substitute for non-tax revenues. The latter will fall from 3.5 percent to 2 percent of the GDP due especially to the big fall in SBP profits, with the fall in interest rates.
Second, the bottom line is the impact on the balance of payments. The sizes of the current account deficit and financial account surplus projected by the IMF have already been highlighted above. Within the current account, exports are expected to show an average growth rate of 7.1 percent over the five years, while imports are projected to increase at a somewhat slower growth rate of 6.7 percent. The liabilities under primary income outflows are anticipated to grow by a marginal 1.2 percent. However, there is the expectation of significant increase in remittances as highlighted above.
The projected financial account of the balance of payments contains an increase of as much as 28 percent annually, with the level rising from USD 2.4 billion in 2024-25 to almost USD 10 billion by 2029-30. This will be due primarily to a diversification of inflows. Net borrowings from multilaterals and governments will be lower due to higher level of amortization. Foreign direct investment will rise to USD 3 billion.
The big jump will be in inflows from private sources. They were negative USD 1.8 billion in 2024-25. Improved perceptions of Pakistan’s external position are expected to lead to an increase in inflows from international commercial banks and by bond flotations to over USD 6 billion by 2029-30.
Overall, the IMF medium-term projections of Pakistan’s economy are positive in nature. Thanks are due to IMF for having confidence in the process of economic management in the country, such that by end of the present programme, Pakistan will emerge as an economy characterized by both growth and stabilisation.
However, there is need to emphasize that many of the projections are very optimistic in nature, including, first, that Pakistan will achieve a significant degree of export-led growth and remittances will continue growing from the big jump in 2024-25. This is anticipated despite the likelihood that the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) index will be rising with limited nominal depreciation of the rupee. Already, the index stands at 105. It is not surprising that exports have fallen by 6.2 percent in the first five months of 2025-26.
Further, imports are likely to rise faster than projected by the IMF because of the overvalued exchange rate and significant fall in interest rates. This effect is already visible. Imports have gone up by 13.6 percent in the first five months of 2025-26 in the presence of nominal stability of the rupee. Overall, there is a big risk that the current account deficit could be significantly larger than the level projected by the IMF over the next few years.
Second, the IMF projections indicate that the Provincial governments will be successful in raising the tax-to-GDP ratio from 0.6 percent to 1.6 percent of the GDP in the next five years. The largest ‘tax gap’ at the provincial level is in the agricultural income tax. However, the powerful lobby of large farmers will continue to prevent substantially larger collections from this tax.
Third, there is the expectation of a very large reduction of 3 percent of the GDP in the debt servicing burden, due to the fall in interest rates. The fall in interest rates it will also facilitate a rise in the level of gross fixed capital formation, mostly by the private sector, from under 12 percent of the GDP in 2024-25 to 14 percent of the GDP by 2029-30. However, this will hinge on the end in the investment slump in the industrial sector since 2022-23.
Fourth, contrary to the IMF projection that development spending can remain unchanged at 2.4 percent of the GDP over the next five years without creating infrastructure constraints to faster growth, there will be the need for raising especially the Federal PSDP significantly as a percentage of the GDP. This will be necessary to facilitate increase in water resources, improvement in the electricity transmission and distribution network and the expansion of the network of highways.
Overall, Pakistan stands at a critical juncture. Up till now, efforts at stabilization of the economy have implied lower economic growth, and a rise in unemployment and poverty. The IMF expects Pakistan to be able to raise the GDP growth rate to 4.5 percent by 2027-28 after the end of the Programme and maintain a high level of foreign reserves equivalent to an import cover of over three months. We hope and pray that this happens.

Nepra stated that despite determining consumer-end tariffs in a manner that fully covers the revenue requirements of all entities across the power supply chain, persistent structural inefficiencies and the historical poor performance of distribution companies (Discos) leave little reason to expect that circular debt can be sustainably controlled.
The regulator explained that if NEPRA-determined tariffs were fully implemented and all sector entities met prescribed performance targets, each entity’s financial obligations would be met and circular debt would not arise.
READ MORE:Govt wants to alter KE consumer-end tariff as per Nepra fixation
However, in practice, several power sector entities fail to achieve these targets due to weak governance, poor recovery performance, and high technical and commercial losses, resulting in insufficient revenue collection and the continued accumulation of circular debt.
As of June 30, 2025, circular debt in Pakistan’s power sector stood at approximately Rs1.614 trillion, compared to Rs2.393 trillion a year earlier, reflecting a reduction of around Rs780 billion. Nepra noted, however, that this decline does not represent a structural improvement and mirrors similar short-term reductions seen in the past.
According to Nepra, both current and previous declines in circular debt primarily resulted from external financial injections rather than from meaningful sector reforms. During FY 2024-25, DISCO inefficiencies contributed approximately Rs265 billion through excessive T&D losses and Rs132 billion due to low recovery ratios. Despite these shortcomings, the overall circular debt figure declined during the year.
Nepra attributed this reduction to the Government of Pakistan securing commercial financing to retire liabilities of Power Holding (Private) Limited (PHPL) and clear arrears owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). While this intervention temporarily lowered circular debt, it failed to address the sector’s underlying inefficiencies.
To service the cost of this borrowing, most electricity consumers — excluding a few protected domestic categories—are now required to pay an additional Rs3.23 per kWh under the Debt Servicing Surcharge for several years. Nepra noted that this surcharge effectively transfers the burden of sector inefficiencies to consumers and represents one of the largest components of the end-user tariff, after the Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) and Energy Purchase Price (EPP).
Nepra further stated that KE, the country’s only private-sector distribution company, does not contribute to circular debt, as it absorbs the financial impact of higher losses and lower recoveries instead of passing these costs on to consumers. Despite this, KE consumers remain subject to the DSS. To date, KE has collected and remitted Rs35.76 billion under the DSS to the Government of Pakistan and CPPA-G.
The regulator observed that had public-sector Discos been privatized in line with the 1992 power sector reform strategy, trillions of rupees in losses could have been avoided, and consumers would have benefited from improved service quality. Nepra added that although challenges to privatization persist even after more than two decades, these hurdles can be overcome through well-designed strategies and firm political commitment.
Given the prevailing structural inefficiencies and the historical performance of Discos, Nepra concluded that there is little justification to expect sustainable control of circular debt or lasting improvements in the power sector under the existing framework.

Nepra data shows that KE has recorded a sustained decline in transmission and distribution losses since its privatization in 2005, when losses were reported at around 40 percent. By FY 2024-25, KE’s losses had fallen to below 15 percent, a level that remains above ideal benchmarks but is significantly lower than those observed across several public-sector Discos. The regulator attributed this long-term reduction to improved governance mechanisms and greater operational accountability following privatization.
In its assessment of recovery performance, Nepra observed that KE absorbed the impact of recovery shortfalls internally rather than transferring the burden to the power supply chain. While KE consumers continued to pay the federally imposed Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS), under which Rs. 35.76 billion was collected during the year, the utility itself did not add to sector-wide payment arrears, distinguishing its financial treatment from that of government-owned Discos.
Referring to broader sector reforms, Nepra noted that KE’s post-privatization experience illustrates the potential benefits of reduced government control, including greater financial discipline and operational responsiveness. However, the regulator cautioned that KE’s performance should be viewed as part of a wider reform discussion rather than an isolated solution, emphasising that comprehensive structural changes across all distribution companies would be required to achieve sustainable sector-wide improvement.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40401925/nepra-approves-uniform-national-average-tariff,"Nepra approves uniform national average tariff, ignoring industry and export sector concerns - Business Recorder","ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has approved uniform national average tariff for Discos and KE for CY26 despite serious concerns of industry and export sector.
The industrial sector on Monday strongly opposed a cross-subsidy of nearly Rs130 billion imposed on industrial and export-oriented consumers, warning that the burden has rendered industrial growth and exports unfeasible.
Industry representatives expressed these concerns during a public hearing on the Federal Government’s motion for the determination of a uniform electricity tariff for the Current Year (CY) 2026, following recent tariff determinations by Nepra, which proposed a reduction of 61 paisa per kWh for CY 2026.

NEPRA determined the tariffs of distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26. These determinations were forwarded to the Federal Government for filing a uniform tariff application in accordance with the NEPRA Act. Section 31(4) of the Act requires NEPRA, on the basis of a uniform tariff application, to determine a uniform tariff for public-sector licensees engaged in power supply, in the consumer’s interest, based on consolidated accounts.
Subsequently, the Power Division filed a motion for determination of the uniform tariff based on the consolidated revenue requirement of DISCOs. In line with the National Electricity Policy, the uniform tariff will also apply to K-Electric (KE) consumers.
Accordingly, NEPRA was requested to issue a revised Schedule of Tariff (SoT) for KE consumers, to be notified from January 1, 2026.
The hearing officiated by Chairman NEPRA, Waseem Mukhtar (Zoom, Member (Development) Maqsood Anwar Khan (Zoom) and Member (Law) Amina Ahmed.
A Power Division team, led by Additional Secretary (Power Finance) Mehfooz Bhatti and Naveed Qaiser, gave a comprehensive presentation covering power-sector issues related to tariffs, revenue requirements, future generation forecasts, and the impact of solarisation, including net metering and off-grid solutions.
Industry representatives disclosed that recent consultations with the government revealed cross-subsidies of Rs131 billion within DISCOs, while total cross-subsidies in KE’s jurisdiction amount to approximately Rs160 billion. This means industrial consumers are effectively paying up to Rs7 per kWh in cross-subsidy.
Referring to the textile spinning sector, participants highlighted that the number of spindles in Pakistan has fallen from 10.25 million to nearly half. In contrast, China has installed more than 35 million spindles in Xinjiang province—its poorest region—and is adding another 15 million spindles.
The Chinese government provides electricity at around 5 cents per kWh, enabling rapid industrial expansion and job creation. Electricity tariffs in other parts of China range between 7 to 8 cents per kWh.
In comparison, Pakistan’s industrial electricity tariff stands at 12.9 cents per kWh, making exports uncompetitive. Chinese textile products, including yarn and fabric, are already flooding Pakistani markets.
“If the industry is relieved of cross-subsidy, the tariff would be around 9 cents per kWh, which could make exports viable. However, this option is being denied solely due to cross-subsidy,” a representative said.
Industry leaders noted that domestic consumers have reduced their monthly electricity consumption to below 200 units to remain eligible for subsidies by installing small solar plants.
Aamir Sheikh stated that neither industry nor exports can survive under current tariffs, adding that the cross-subsidy mechanism must be eliminated entirely. “The solution to Pakistan’s economic problems lies in industrial job creation, not in forcing industry to subsidise the domestic sector,” he said.
Industry representatives also pointed out that industrial consumers pay an additional Rs3.23 per unit as Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)—another form of cross-subsidy—despite having no role in the creation of circular debt. They noted that 10,000 people enter the job market daily, requiring the same number of new jobs to prevent social instability.
“Industry pays around Rs35 per kWh against an actual cost of Rs29 per kWh, with full bill recovery and negligible line losses. The entire DSS is effectively a cross-subsidy,” Aamir Sheikh maintained.
Arif Bilwani urged the government and NEPRA to abolish peak and off-peak tariff structures to ensure industrial survival.
All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) emphasized that removing the cross-subsidy burden from B3 and B4 consumers would generate economy-wide benefits. Aligning tariffs for large-scale manufacturing with regional benchmarks of around 9 cents per kWh would restore competitiveness, boost exports, attract investment, and create jobs. Increased electricity demand would also improve capacity utilization, reduce per-unit costs, and lower tariffs across all consumer categories.
Rehan Javed proposed several recommendations: (i) transparent disclosure of cross-subsidies embedded in industrial tariffs; (ii) a time-bound plan for eliminating industrial cross-subsidies; (iii) provision of any remaining support through explicit, targeted budget subsidies instead of embedded tariffs; and (iv) ensuring that industrial off-peak consumption is not treated as the primary subsidy pool.
He also urged NEPRA to apply voltage-wise allowed loss factors, differentiate distribution margins by voltage, and notify a defined high-voltage cost-of-service adjustment for B-category consumers.
Responding to industry concerns, Naveed Qaiser said the government remains in continuous consultation with stakeholders to reduce industrial tariffs. He noted that industrial cross-subsidies have been reduced from Rs225 billion to Rs102 billion, equivalent to a reduction of Rs5.13 per kWh.
Overall industrial tariffs have fallen from Rs62.33 per kWh in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per kWh, a reduction of Rs16.68 per kWh (26 per cent).
The Power Division informed the Authority that Pakistan’s current installed power generation capacity stands at 58,013 MW, including 9,590 MW from government-owned power plants, 2,007 MW from hydel IPPs, 11,547 MW from thermal IPPs, and 2,795 MW from renewable IPPs.
Power available on the National Grid Company system is 36,397 MW, while KE’s generation capacity is 2,647 MW. Net metering contributes 6,340 MW, and off-grid solar stands at 12,629 MW.
Under the new Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), installed capacity is projected to reach 87,209 MW by 2035, with 90 per cent clean energy, 10 per cent fossil fuel, 96 per cent local resources, and 4 per cent imported fuel.
Pakistan’s power import bill, which rose from $1.9 billion in 2018 to $2.4 billion, is projected to decline to $0.3 billion by 2035.
On solarisation, the Power Division reported that electricity sales declined from 113 billion units in 2023 and are expected to fall to 101 billion units by 2026, largely due to increased solar adoption. This has created a financial burden of approximately Rs3.5 per kWh on DISCO consumers who continue to pay electricity bills.
For FY 2026, 116.40 billion units were received, while 113.58 billion units are expected in CY 2026. Electricity sales stood at 103.56 billion units in FY 2026 and are projected at 101.23 billion units in CY 2026. Transmission and distribution losses are expected to decline from 11.04 per cent to 10.87 per cent.
Energy charges are projected to decrease by Rs1.74 per kWh, capacity charges to increase by Rs0.50 per kWh, Use of System Charges by Rs0.51 per kWh, and distribution margins by Rs0.26 per kWh.
Prior year adjustments will rise by Rs0.14 per kWh, while revenue requirements will decline by Rs0.33 per kWh and working capital by Rs0.29 per kWh. Overall, the Net Revenue Requirement is expected to fall by Rs0.61 per kWh during CY 2026.
Naveed Qaiser further stated that power sector circular debt which stood at Rs 1.6 trillion on June 30, 2025 will remain the same as seasonal variation of Rs 79 billion will be offset.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402501,S&S organisation retention: NGC and PPMC lock horns - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The National Grid Company (NGC) — formerly the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) — and the Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) have reportedly locked horns over the proposed retention of the Standards and Specifications (S&S) organisation, sources close to the Managing Director of PPMC toldBusiness Recorder.
In this regard, the Power Division has issued directions to NTDC, while the Minister has provided guidance regarding the transfer of the Standards and Specifications (S&S) function for 11kV and below from NGC to PPMC.
However, as a state-owned enterprise, NGC is required to obtain formal approval from its Board of Directors for any such functional transfer. A due diligence process is currently under way.
READ MORE:Rs23bn NGC-PMLTC dispute lands in CPEC panel’s camp
Based on the findings of a constituted committee and NGC’s institutional experience, the newly appointed Managing Director of NGC, Altaf Hussain Malik, has highlighted several critical risks associated with the proposed transfer.
Safety and system integrity:The S&S function ensures uniformity, quality, and safety across the power distribution network. NGC possesses decades of engineering expertise, accredited laboratories, and compliance with international standards such as IEC, IEEE, and ANSI. Transferring this role to a non-engineering entity like PPMC—which lacks the requisite technical capacity and testing infrastructure—could compromise equipment reliability, increase system failures, and pose significant public safety risks.
Regulatory and legal non-compliance:NGC operates under a Nepra licence, with the S&S mandate embedded in the Grid Code. PPMC is an unlicensed entity with no statutory role in engineering standards.
Any such transfer would violate existing regulations and require extensive legislative and regulatory amendments, creating legal uncertainty and potential audit objections.
Financial and operational impact:The S&S office is a profitable, revenue-generating unit for NGC, contributing approximately Rs 30–40 million per month. Its transfer without proper financial and operational valuation would result in substantial revenue losses to the national exchequer and disrupt service continuity to DISCOs — none of which have raised concerns about NGC’s current S&S services.
Misalignment with sector reforms and global practice:Globally, standards and specifications are managed by utilities and are ultimately vested within distribution companies once they develop in-house capacity.
Transferring this function to an intermediate, non-technical government entity does not align with international best practices and would add unnecessary bureaucratic layering without any technical or operational benefit.

Previously, approval of the Commission was required. The registrar’s existing powers under section 10 to review proposed name appropriateness remain intact, thereby ensuring that regulatory safeguards are still maintained.
Where a company changes its name it shall, for a period of ninety days from the date of issue of a certificate by the registrar under sub-section (1), continue to mention its former name along with its new name on the outside of every office or place in which its business is carried on and in every document or notice referred to in section 22.
READ MORE:OPINION: Companies Act 2017: Significant proposed amendments by SECP — I
Provided that this requirement shall not apply to a single member company and private company, not being Public Interest Company and subsidiary of listed company.
Commencement of Business: The requirement under section 19 for a separate declaration of “commencement of business” has become redundant and unnecessary in view of the existing legal and procedural framework. It is now proposed to be eliminated
Registered Office: A company shall have a correspondence or registered office to which all communications and notices shall be addressed. In case no registered office address is notified by the Company at time of incorporation, correspondence address shall be deemed as registered office address of the Company for all purposes of the Act.
Principal Line of Business: Under the proposed amendment principle line may be replaced with sector name only in order to simplify procedure and cater requirement of economic survey and other government organization.
The International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) will be adopted for sector classification for which concept paper has already been issued. Moreover, change in sector is also not required to be reported on any separate form, such change will be updated in annual return and updated Articles of Association shall be filed with annual return.
Merger of Public Sector not for profit companies: Public sector company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, may be merged into another public sector for-profit company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, or its assets can be transferred to another public sector for-profit company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, provided that the transferor company has obtained funds or donations or seed money or capital only from the Government. Provided that section 42 company may be merged into another section 42 company, preferably having similar or identical objects subject to the provisions contained in section 284 of the Act.
Private Company to Single Member Company: (1) A private company, not being a public interest company and a subsidiary of a listed company may be converted into a single-member company without prior approval of the Commission in writing by passing a special resolution.
Issue of Shares at Discount: Subject to sanction of resolution for issue of shares at discount in the case of listed company the mandatory approval of Commission is being dispensed with. This is a step in the right direction.
Reduction in Capital: A private limited company having a share capital may reduce its share capital by special resolution and supported by a solvency statement of all the directors, as referred in Section 89A.
The company may reduce its share capital in any way, namely-
(a) cancel any paid-up share capital which is lost or un-represented by available assets; or for which subscription money has not been received from subscribers;
(b) pay off any paid-up share capital which is in excess of the needs of the company.
It is proposed to be prescribed. This is necessarily required as proposed for voluntary winding up of private limited companies.
(a) accounting and book keeping services;
(b) internal audit;
(c) design and implementation of any financial information system;
(d) actuarial services;
(e) investment advisory services;
(f) investment banking services;
(g) rendering of outsourced financial services;
(h) management services; and
(i) any other kind of services as may be specified: Provided that an auditor or audit firm who or which has been performing any non-audit services shall comply with the provisions of this section before the closure of the first financial year of the company.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, the term “directly or indirectly” shall include rendering of services by the auditor,—
(i) in case of auditor being an individual, either himself or through his relative or any other person connected or associated with such individual or through any other entity, whatsoever, in which such individual has significant influence or control, or whose name or trade-mark or brand is used by such individual;
(ii) in case of auditor being a firm, either itself or through any of its partners or through its parent, subsidiary or associate entity or through any other entity, whatsoever, in which the firm or any partner of the firm has significant influence or control, or whose name or trade mark or brand is used by the firm or any of its partners.
At present, PSX Rule Book lists down the prohibited services. Pursuant to this a statutory auditor of a listed company is prohibited to provide following non-assurance services:
(a) Preparing financial statements, accounting records and accounting services;
(b) Financial information technology system design and implementation, significant to overall financial statements;
(c) Appraisal or valuation services for material items of financial statements;
(d) Acting as an Appointed Actuary within the meaning of the term defined by the Insurance Ordinance, 2000;

(l) Share Registration Services (Transfer Agents); and
(m) Any other service(s) which the Council with the prior approval of the Commission, may determine to be a “prohibited service”.
Register of members: Every company shall keep an electronic register of its members. An electronic register must contain such particulars of each member as may be specified.
Power of Court to Rectify the Register of Members: Section 126 of the Companies Act, 2017 empowered the Court to order rectification of the register of members or debenture-holders in cases of fraudulent or erroneous entry, omission, or unnecessary delay. While this provision provided judicial oversight, in practice it resulted in lengthy, costly, and time-consuming litigation, even for matters of a purely administrative or procedural nature. With the evolution of corporate regulation and increased reliance on electronic filings and real-time data maintenance, the continued requirement of approaching courts for rectification of registers become disproportionate and inconsistent with modern regulatory practices. The retention of section 126 also resulted in duplication of remedies, as similar relief mechanisms already exist under sections 87 and 464 of the Act. Moreover to cater this, section 74A is inserted and sec 464(7) is amended to further address it.
Statutory Meeting: The elimination of the requirement of holding a statutory meeting is proposed as the provision has no practical utility in the present regulatory framework.
The original objective of ensuring initial disclosure of a company’s affairs is already achieved through existing requirements. .
Annual General Meeting: Every company is required to hold an annual general meeting within sixteen months from the date of its incorporation and thereafter once in every calendar year within a period of one hundred and twenty days following the close of its financial year. This requirement is proposed to be eliminated for private companies, not being public interest companies and subsidiaries of listed companies, where the board of directors holds at least seventy five percent of voting rights.
Provisions as to meetings and votes.— A company may hold a general meeting-
a) at a physical venue; or
b) by using virtual meeting technology through service providers in the manner prescribed; or c) both at a physical venue and by using virtual meeting technology through service providers in the manner prescribed.
Provided that from a date to be notified by the Commission, every company shall be required to hold e-meetings and conduct e-voting through a prescribed e-platform, in the manner specified by the Commission, for such class or classes of companies as may be notified.’
Explanation: “Service provider” means any person registered by the Commission to provide an e-platform for meetings in terms of Section 134A.
Companies face considerable practical difficulties in allocating nominal shareholding to the independent and woman directors for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of this section. Independent and female directors also face considerable difficulties dealing with ownership of the companies in which they are acting as independent directors, including cumbersome asset disclosures and tax-related disclosures at the time of transfer of shares.
Independent Director: The independent director of a listed company shall be elected or appointed in the same manner as specified by the Commission.
Disqualification of Director: Where a person has been penalised under section 127 of the Act or has contravened the provisions of the sections 182, 184, 197, 208, 222, 243, 254, 261, 272, 324, 400, 401, 402, 405, 418, 424 and 497 or has been penalized under section 193 of the Act, the said person cannot be a director.
Loan to Directors: Restriction on loan to directors shall not apply in case of loan given to the chief executive or the whole-time director who is an employee of the company, subject to the condition that the loan is given as per the approved company policy for loans to employees.
Method of Contracting: These provisions do not relate to Company have been deleted.
Liability of Undesired Activities: Liability for “undesired activities” is subjective and restrictive for shareholders. Eliminating the section will reduce ambiguity and will give freedom to shareholders who are actual owners of the company.
Inspection of books of account by the Commission: It is proposed that for the purpose of ascertaining whether a company who is complying with or has complied with any provision or requirement of this Act or the terms and conditions of licence or registration, the Commission may from time to time inspect any record or document relating to any company. This provision already exists however it is proposed to clarify the matter.
Declaration of Dividend: At present, the following condition prevails:
(2) No dividend shall be declared or paid by a company for any financial year out of the profits of the company made from the sale or disposal of any immovable property or assets of a capital nature comprised in the undertaking or any of the undertaking of the company, unless the business of the company consists, whether wholly or partly, of selling and purchasing any such property or assets, except after such profits are set off or adjusted against losses arising from the sale of any such immovable property or assets of a capital nature: Provided that no dividend shall be declared or paid out of unrealized gain on investment property credited to profit and loss account.
The provision is proposed to be replaced by:
(2) A resolution of directors passed under subsection (1) shall contain a statement that, in the opinion of the directors, the company will immediately after the distribution, satisfy the solvency test.
The deletion of sub-section (2) removes restriction on dividend distribution from capital gains, which no longer reflects modern accounting standards and business realities. Instead, the proposed proviso introduces a solvency test to ensure that dividends, whether from current or accumulated profits, are declared only when the company can meet its financial obligations
Unclaimed Dividend: The unclaimed dividend shall vest with the Federal Government with oversight by the Commission.
Cost Audit. Provisions relating to “Audit of Cost Accounts” are proposed to be eliminated.
Right of Commission: A new provision has been inserted to the effect that the Commission may investigate a dispute exists among the members or directors regarding shareholding or directorship arising from a fraudulent entry, an entry made without sufficient cause, or an omission in the relevant statutory register.
Management by Administrator. The Commission or the registrar has been given powers to appoint administrators on its own motion also if a situation for appointment of administrator exists. Previously, this right was subject to the approval of members having not less than sixty percent of the paid up capital of a company or a secured creditor or secured creditors having interest equivalent
Process of voluntary winding up: The amendment proposes that the Court has no role in the process of voluntary winding-up proceedings, which are intended to be managed independently by the company and its creditors without judicial intervention. Accordingly, the power to approve any extension in the completion of winding-up proceedings has been aligned with the voluntary nature of the process and vested in the company, through a special resolution in the general meeting, and in the creditors’ meeting in case of a creditors’ voluntary winding up. This change ensures procedural consistency, reduces unnecessary court involvement, and promotes efficiency, self-regulation, and timely closure of companies.
Unregistered Company: An unregistered company “includes any partnership, association or company consisting of more than seven members”. This definition is proposed to be deleted.
Security clearance of shareholder and director.—The Commission may require the security clearance of any shareholder or director or other office bearer of a company or class of companies as may be notified by the concerned Minister-in-charge of the Federal Government.
Explanation.— For the purposes of this section, the expression “Minister-in-Charge of the Federal Government” shall mean the Minister-in-Charge of the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control.
(a) the document is complete in all material respects and complies with the requirements of law;
(b) all prescribed fees and penalties, if any, have been duly paid; and
(c) the document is properly authenticated in the manner prescribed, the registrar shall accept such return or document for registration and record the same in the register.
The registrar shall issue a certificate, acknowledgment, or such other confirmation of acceptance as may be prescribed.
Acceptance of a document or return under this section shall not be construed as a certification of the correctness, validity, or legality of the contents thereof, and the responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the information contained therein shall remain with the company and its officers.
(i) clear, legible, accessible, and capable of being readily retrieved;
(ii) maintained in a manner that ensures authenticity, integrity, and reproducibility in accordance with applicable legal standards;
(iii) capable of being produced or presented to the Commission or any other authority when so required under the law; and
(iv) protected from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-section (1), the Commission may, by notification or directive, require any company or class of companies to:-
(i) maintain records in such system, programme, or format - whether physical, electronic, digital, or any combination thereof - as may be specified; and
(ii) provide, submit, or transmit data or information in real time, periodic, or batch form through such physical or automated mechanism as may be prescribed, including but not limited to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Data Acquisition Portals (DAPs), Secure File Transfers (FTPs), or other secure and automated data-sharing systems.
(3) The Commission may prescribe such standards, security protocols, and procedures as it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality, reliability, and lawful use of data transmitted or maintained under this section.
The Commission or the registrar may, upon an application being made to it within sixty days from the date of any order passed by it otherwise than in revision under sub-section (1), or on its own motion, review such order, and such review order shall be final.
An order passed or made by the Federal Government under this Act shall be subject to review by the Federal Government of its own motion or on an application made to it within sixty days from the date of the order.
The orders relating to mergers, etc., are supposed to be excluded from this provision.
Appeal against order passed by officer of the Commission. Any person aggrieved by any order passed under this Act may, within thirty days of such order, except as otherwise provided in this Act, prefer an appeal to an officer authorized by the Commission where the order has been passed or upheld by the Registrar of Companies. Consequential to amendments proposed in section 464(6) & (7) where powers are given/amended to the Registrar of Companies. In light of these amendments, the appellate structure envisaged under section 480(a), which provides for an appeal to a registrar designated by the Commission against orders passed by officers subordinate to the Registrar, has become redundant and no longer relevant in the context of actions taken under sections 464(6) and (7).
Definition of the term ‘material’. It is proposed that it would mean any information which, if altered or obscured, would reasonably influence the decision of the stakeholders relying on such information.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402202,Siemens (Pakistan) Engineering: performance and outlook - Business Recorder,"Siemens (Pakistan) Engineering (PSX: SIEM) was incorporated in Pakistan as a public limited company in 1953. The principal activity of the company is the implementation of projects under contracts and also manufacturing, installation and sale of electronic and electrical capital goods.
SIEM’s business portfolio includes smart infrastructure, digital industries, smart grid and smart buildings, power generation and distribution as well as automation and digitization, to name a few.
Pattern of Shareholding
As of September 30, 2025, SIEM has a total of 8.247 million shares outstanding which are held by 1261 shareholders. Siemens AG, Germany (parent company) has the majority stake of 93.03 percent in the company followed by general public holding 3.31 percent of SIEM’s shares.
Adamjee Insurance Company Limited accounts for 1.80 percent of SIEM’s shares. The remaining shares of SIEM are held by other categories of shareholders.
Historical Performance (2019-24)
SIEM’s topline and bottomline which had been on the skids in 2019 and 2020 boasted a turnaround in 2021 whereby the company not only posted topline growth but also recovered from the net loss posted in the previous year. In the subsequent years, the topline continued to expand.
Despite strengthening net sales, the bottomline slid in 2023 and ended up in the negative zone in 2024. The margins which had been declining until 2020 picked up in 2021 and 2022 only to fall back in 2023 and 2024.
SIEM’s margins posted their optimum level in 2022 and their weakest level in 2024 (see the graph of profitability ratios). The detailed performance review of the period under consideration is given below.
In 2019, SIEM’s topline dropped by 14.59 percent year-on-year to clock in at Rs.16,672.92 million. This came on the back of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in Pakistan and also because some major projects in Afghanistan were completed in 2018.
Cost of sales slid by 12.64 percent year-on-year in 2019, however, high per unit cost due to inflation and Pak Rupee depreciation and also because of high fixed overhead cost due to low capacity utilization, pushed down gross profit by 24.21 percent year-on-year in 2019.
GP margin also slumped from 16.9 percent in 2018 to 15 percent in 2019. Distribution expense inched down by 2.17 percent year-on-year in 2019 mainly on account of higher commission income earned during the year and also because of reversal of allowance on deposits and other receivables. Administrative expense grew by 20.20 percent year-on-year in 2019 on the back of higher payroll expense despite drop in the number of employees from 665 in 2018 to 602 in 2019.
Other income nosedived by 80.76 percent year-on-year in 2019 because of lesser liabilities written back during the year and lesser insurance claims. Other expense also shrank by 46.22 percent year-on-year in 2019 which was the result of lower provisioning for WWF and WPPF.
Despite a check on expenses, operating profit fell by 37.13 percent year-on-year in 2019 with OP margin sliding down to 8.6 percent from OP margin of 11.7 percent recorded in 2018.
Net finance expense magnified by 444.26 percent year-on-year in 2019 due to higher discount rate. This culminated into 38.8 percent year-on-year decline in net profit which clocked in at Rs.709.47 million in 2019 with NP margin of 4.26 percent versus NP margin of 5.94 percent recorded in 2018. EPS also dwindled from Rs.140.56 in 2018 to Rs.86.03 in 2019.
2020 brought about further 23.20 percent decline in SIEM’s topline which was recorded at Rs.12,805.38 million. This was on account of COVID-19 which completely halted economic activities for three months and slowed down the growth momentum for the rest of the year.
Cost of sales shriveled by 15.92 percent year-on-year in 2020, yet couldn’t prevent the gross profit from slipping by 64.42 percent year-on-year in 2020.
GP margin plunged to 6.95 percent in 2020.
Distribution expense tapered off by 7 percent year-on-year in 2020 on account of reversal of loss allowance on trade receivables and also because of the discounting of long-term loans and trade receivables.
Administrative expense grew by 7.23 percent year-on-year in 2020 due to higher payroll expense on account of inflation. This was despite the fact that the number of employees was reduced to 539 in 2020.
Other income didn’t offer any support either and went down by 46.49 percent year-on-year in 2020 due to lower gain on sale of property, plant and equipment and also because of no insurance claims recorded during the year.
SIEM didn’t incur any other expense during the year as the company didn’t book any provisioning for WWF and WPPF in 2020.
The company incurred operating loss of Rs. 55.44 million in 2020. While the company availed SBP Refinance scheme for the payment of salaries and wages and also obtained lease liabilities which built up its long-term liabilities, short-term borrowings majorly reduced during 2020. This coupled with lower discount rate in the second half of 2020 (year ending September), resulted in 26.40 percent year-on-year decline in net finance expense.
SIEM posted net loss of Rs.496.015 in 2020 with loss per share of Rs.60.14.
SIEM’s fate turned around in 2021 as its topline posted 12 percent year-on-year rise to clock in at Rs.14,348.95 million. In 2021, topline growth came after two successive years of decline.
The sales growth was mainly backed by energy transmission business which received new orders worth Rs.15 billion in 2021 versus new orders of Rs.5.6 billion in the previous year.
Targeted measures of cost optimization resulted in 172.29 percent year-on-year rise in gross profit in 2021 with GP margin jumping up to 16.9 percent, the level last seen in 2018. Distribution expense grew by 20.83 percent year-on-year in 2021 as a result of low commission income as well as high payroll expense incurred during the year.
Administrative expense also posted year-on-year rise of 9.6 percent in 2021. SIEM also booked allowance worth Rs.149.95 million for ECL in 2021 as against reversal of Rs.13.99 million recorded in the previous year.
However, it was nullified by the gain of Rs. 247.85 million on disposal of leasehold land and building during the year.
SIEM also made other income of Rs.65.08 million during the year which was 441.70 percent higher than that recorded in 2020. This mainly comprised of liabilities no longer payable written back during the year.
Unlike last year when the company incurred losses and didn’t book any provisioning for WWF and WPPF, the company booked provisioning of Rs.85.3 million in 2021. SIEM recorded operating profit of Rs.1360.13 million in 2021 with OP margin of 9.48 percent.
The lucky streak continued as the company recognized net finance income of Rs.29.92 in 2021, as against the rest of the years under consideration where it incurred net finance expense. This was on account of a massive decline in borrowings coupled with low discount rate post COVID-19.
SIEM posted net profit of Rs.850.01 million in 2021 with NP margin of 5.92 percent. EPS clocked in at Rs. 103.07 in 2021.
Despite geopolitical and macroeconomic impediments in 2022, SIEM’s topline posted a staggering 30.37 percent year-on-year improvement to clock in at Rs.18,707.06 million. The major wins of 2022 were energy transmission contract with K-Electric to build the KANUPP as well as gaining SAP license, implementation and maintenance contract for NTDC.
SIEM also recorded gain of Rs.2000.72 million on derivatives due to sharp depreciation of Pak Rupee during the year. Cost of sales grew by 32.76 percent year-on-year mainly on account of Pak Rupee depreciation, fuel and power price hikes as well as inflationary pressure.
However, robust revenue and gain on derivatives translated into 101.14 percent rise in gross profit with GP margin climbing up to 26 percent – the highest ever achieved by the company.
A major hit to SIEM’s profitability in 2022 came from expected credit losses aggregating Rs.874.11 million recorded during the year due to geopolitical impediments in the energy transmission business which made SIEM’s credit recoveries questionable.
Distribution expense escalated by 8.52 percent year-on-year in 2021 which was primarily on account of a spike in payroll expense, receivables written off during the year, advertising and promotion as well as travelling charges.
Administrative expense also registered 8.48 percent hike in 2022 on the back of payroll expense as the number of employees grew from 536 in 2021 to 576 in 2022. Other income shrank by 50.46 percent in 2022 as lesser amount of liabilities was written back in 2022 when compared to the previous year. 125.49 percent higher other expense incurred in 2022 was due to higher provisioning done for WWF and WPPF.
Operating profit boasted 91.4 percent year-on-year growth with OP margin rising to 13.92 percent in 2022. SIEM incurred net finance expense of Rs.22.97 million in 2022 which was the result of higher discount rate. Bottomline grew by 103 percent year-on-year in 2022 to clock in at Rs.1725.98 million with NP margin of 9.23 percent and EPS of Rs.209.28.
In 2023, SIEM’s net sales grew by a splendid 56.9 percent year-on-year to clock in at Rs.29,351.73 million. This was mainly on account of energy transmission business. Contract with NTDC for the construction of grid station at Allama Iqbal Industrial city/ M-3 Faislabad was the major achievement for SIEM within the energy business.
Gain on derivatives also improved by 54.63 percent in 2023. Cost of sales grew by 70.93 percent year-on-year in 2023 due to rising commodity prices, Pak Rupee depreciation and soaring inflation. Gross profit inched up by 10.44 percent in 2023, however, GP margin drastically fell to 18.35 percent. 23.45 percent escalation in distribution expense in 2023 was the result of higher payroll expense and a surge in IT, data communication and networking charges. Furthermore, the company made no scrap sales and a petite commission income during the year.
Administrative expense escalated by 19.94 percent in 2023 due to higher payroll expense incurred during the year despite the fact that SIEM trimmed its workforce from 576 employees in 2022 to 498 employees in 2023.
Allowance for ECL mounted by 47.57 percent in 2023. Other income also contracted by 56.42 percent in 2023 due to lesser liabilities written back during the year. Lesser profit related provisioning during the year translated into 80.59 percent lower other expense incurred during the year. All these factors translated into 1.87 percent lower operating profit in 2023 with OP margin sinking to 8.7 percent.
SIEM’s net finance expense magnified by 1142.14 percent in 2023 as the company obtained short-term borrowings worth Rs.4048.937 million during the year. Increased borrowings coupled with higher discount rate greatly took its toll on the bottomline of the company which slid by 17.92 percent year-on-year to clock in at Rs.1416.676 million in 2023 with EPS of Rs.117.72 and NP margin of 4.83 percent.
In 2024, SIEM’s net sales grew by 19.81 percent to clock in at Rs.35,166.30 million. This was mainly on account of demand from the industrial business segments i.e. smart infrastructure and digital industries.
New orders of Rs. 26,079 million were recorded in 2024. However, this couldn’t cascade down as unrealized loss incurred on measurement of foreign currency derivatives (due to appreciation of Pak Rupee against foreign currencies) and high cost of sales suppressed gross profit by 58.76 percent year-on-year in 2024. GP margin drastically fell to its lowest level of 6.32 percent in 2024.
Distribution expense mounted by 35.48 percent in 2024 due to higher payroll expense, business support service charges as well as IT, communication and networking charges incurred during the year.
The company streamlined its workforce to 487 employees in 2024 from 498 employees in 2023, resulting in 33 percent diminution in administrative expense in 2024. Allowance for ECL contracted by 75.50 percent in 2024.
Other expense dropped by 93.34 percent in 2024 as the company reversed the provision booked for WWF. Other income improved by 116.36 percent in 2024. Operating profit tapered off by 93.88 percent in 2024 with OP margin thinning down to 0.44 percent.
The execution of large-scale energy projects during the year required greater borrowings which coupled with elevated discount rate resulted in 590.59 percent higher net finance cost incurred by SIEM in 2024. As a consequence, the company incurred net loss of Rs.2048.087 million in 2024. This translated into loss per share of Rs.248.34 in 2024.
Recent Performance (2025)
In 2025, SIEM recorded net sales of Rs.12,427.111 million, down 64.66 percent year-on-year. This included sales by smart infrastructure and digital industries. Gross profit enhanced by 31.20 percent to clock in at Rs.2914.155 million in 2025.
In 2025, SIEM sold off its energy business to Siemens Energy Pakistan (Private) Limited.
This resulted in unrealized gain recorded on foreign currency derivatives worth Rs.705.082 million due to economic transfers of underlying foreign currency host contracts in 2025. This was against the loss on derivates worth Rs.2596.753 million recorded in the previous year which took its toll on the gross profit in 2024. GP margin clocked in at 23.45 percent in 2025 versus GP margin of 6.32 percent posted in 2024.
Distribution expense dipped by 12.57 percent while administrative expense dropped by 25.92 percent in 2025 due to lesser operating expense from discontinued operations incurred during the year.
SEIM also booked reversal of allowance booked for ECL worth Rs.78.576 from continued operations and Rs.79.291 from discontinued operations in 2025. This was against the allowance of Rs.316.05 million booked on ECL in 2024.
Other income massively dropped from Rs.30.39 million in 2024 to Rs.3.40 million in 2025, down 88.82 percent year-on-year as the company wrote off liabilities no longer payable in the previous year. In contrast to other income, other expense mounted from Rs.2.49 million in 2024 to Rs.92.20 million in 2025 due to high-base effect as the company recorded reversal on provision booked on WWF in 2024.
SIEM posted operating profit of Rs.1466.41 million in 2025, up 837.62 percent year-on-year.
This translated into OP margin of 11.80 percent in 2025 versus OP margin of 0.44 percent posted in 2024. Net finance income of Rs.213.39 million recorded in 2025 versus net finance expense of Rs.1970.12 million registered in 2024 also greatly buttressed the bottomline.
Net finance income was due to no outstanding short-term liabilities in 2025 and also because of higher profit on bank deposits due to improved liquidity position of the company.
Gain on sale of business worth Rs.65.151 million was also recorded in 2025. This translated into net profit of Rs.829.413 million in 2025 versus net loss of Rs.2048.087 million posted in 2024. EPS was recorded at Rs.100.57 in 2025 versus loss per share of Rs.248.34 recorded in 2024. NP margin clocked in at 6.67 percent in 2025.
Future Outlook
After the sale of its energy business, SIEM’s business portfolio now comprises of Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries. The company is putting diligent efforts to grab more orders from these segments.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402591/weak-disco-performance-added-rs397bn-to-circular-debt-in-fy25-nepra-report,Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report - Business Recorder,"Weak performance by Pakistan’s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country’s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.
The report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with “rigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)” to reduce tariffs were a milestone.
However, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.
“Overall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,” the report read.

The regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the “old era of scarcity is ending”, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might “prove to be even more complex”.
Operational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.
In its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.
Meanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the ‘Take or Pay’ electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.
NEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.
“A significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan’s power system.”
The regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.
“It remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.”
On the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.

At the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.
“Governance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan’s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,” the NEPRA report said.
KE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.
In contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.
QESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.

Addressing a news conference here on Sunday, the Minister said the losses incurred by power distribution companies are borne by the federal government instead of being passed on to consumers.
He said that the government is implementing comprehensive power-sector reforms, resulting in a significant increase in recovery and a reduction in losses and circular debt.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402666/power-sector-nepra-sees-limited-progress-despite-fixes,Power sector: Nepra sees ‘limited’ progress despite fixes - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: An assessment of Pakistan’s power sector during FY 2024-25 prompted National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to observe that despite several structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remains limited and insufficient to inspire confidence in the sector’s ability to support sustained industrial growth or provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential segments.
In its State of the Industry Report 2024-25, NEPRA stated that the power sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain efficiency and undermine its contribution to economic development.
The regulator emphasized that power sector entities must operate under commercially binding agreements that clearly define roles, performance standards, and accountability mechanisms.
READ MORE:NEPRA could come under Power Division’s control, as per govt’s latest amendments
Each entity should bear the financial consequences of its inefficiencies rather than passing these costs on to consumers, who are currently burdened with approximately Rs233 billion in Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)—a cost arising not from normal business operations but from inefficiencies within certain sector entities.
According to the report, generation capacity under “Take or Pay” contracts remains significantly underutilized, resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants. Simultaneously, the transmission network is both constrained and underutilized, contributing to higher transmission tariffs and preventing the dispatch of cheaper and more efficient electricity in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, several government-owned DISCOs continue to suffer from poor governance, with transmission and distribution (T&D) losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery, and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. These inefficiencies further exacerbate asset underutilisation across generation, transmission, and distribution, while fueling the circular debt problem.
Nepra noted that challenges faced by power sector entities—largely government-owned—span planning, execution, and operational domains.
Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered financial sustainability and limited the sector’s contribution to economic growth. Weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management further constrain the sector’s ability to provide reliable and affordable electricity.
During FY 2024-25, efforts were made to reduce “Take or Pay” generation capacity through the retirement or decommissioning of inefficient power plants with consistently low utilisation. As a result, 2,829 MW of capacity was retired, decommissioned, or had its Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) terminated.
Consequently, effective operational generation capacity declined to 41,121 MW as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888 MW a year earlier. However, 884 MW of new hydropower capacity—Suki Kinari Hydropower Project—was added during the year.
The utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the CPPA-G system remained 38.82%. NEPRA highlighted that generation costs account for nearly 82% of the electricity tariff. During FY 2024-25, the actual per-unit Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) stood at Rs14.21/kWh, the highest component of the electricity tariff, primarily due to underutilisation of “Take or Pay” plants.
During the year, several power plants approached NEPRA through CPPA-G seeking reductions in generation tariffs. Approval of these adjustments is expected to yield long-term benefits by lowering generation costs, improving tariff efficiency, and stabilizing consumer prices, while also supporting investor confidence through a predictable regulatory environment.
However, NEPRA noted that persistent inefficiencies in public sector power plants — such as the 747 MW Guddu Power Plant, 969 MW Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, and several WAPDA-operated hydro plants—are undermining tariff reduction efforts. These inefficiencies result in lower utilisation, higher costs, and reduced system efficiency, offsetting gains from IPP tariff reductions and plant retirements.
The Part Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) added Rs46.388 billion to generation costs in FY 2024-25, compared to Rs55.671 billion in 2023-24, and, while unavoidable, these costs can be significantly reduced through effective demand-side management.
Similarly, Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) costs declined to Rs13.285 billion, from Rs39.521 billion, though NEPRA said further reductions are possible through better grid management.
Lower utilisation of Thar coal-based power plants, which operated at 67.23% utilisation, also raised generation costs by inflating both CPP and Energy Purchase Price (EPP). Delays in ensuring regular coal supply to Lucky Electric Power Company further exacerbated inefficiencies.
Nepra observed widespread underutilisation of transmission assets, including the 4,000 MW Matiari–Lahore HVDC line, which operated at just 35% utilisation despite payments based on full availability. Manual system logs further hinder accurate assessment of transmission performance.
The poor performance of the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) has led to violations of the economic merit order, increased generation costs, project delays, and cost overruns. Delays in key projects—including KE-NGC interconnection, Lahore North Grid, and SCADA-III—have adversely affected system reliability and finances.
Governance remains the most critical issue confronting DISCOs. KE, PESCO, HESCO, SEPCO, and QESCO were identified as the poorest performers, with excessive losses, low recovery, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Except for TESCO, no DISCO met Nepra-approved T&D loss targets.
Weak DISCO performance contributed approximately Rs397 billion to circular debt during the year. Nepra termed load-shedding based on AT&C losses unlawful and inequitable, as it penalizes compliant consumers and deepens sector inefficiencies.
Rising electricity costs and poor service have pushed consumers—particularly affluent ones—towards rooftop solar PV systems and battery storage, reducing grid demand during non-solar hours.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402644,Power tariffs for industries: KATI seeks cross-subsidy abolition - Business Recorder,"KARACHI: President of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), Muhammad Ikram Rajput, has called for the immediate abolition of cross-subsidy embedded in electricity tariffs for industries, stating that the additional cost ranging from Rs4.5 to Rs7 per unit is rendering industrial operations increasingly uncompetitive and financially unviable.
He said the industrial sector is already grappling with high production costs, weak demand, and mounting financial pressures. In such circumstances, the cross-subsidy amounting to nearly a 20 percent additional burden has made it difficult for many industrial units to sustain even routine operations.
Questioning the policy rationale, Rajput said that if, as claimed by the Ministry of Energy, performance in the power sector has improved, it is difficult to understand why a competitive electricity tariff of around 9 cents per unit for industry remains unattainable. “If the sector is indeed stabilised, why are the benefits not being passed directly on to industrial consumers?” he asked.President KATI stressed that without affordable and competitive electricity, neither export growth nor sustainable job creation is possible. He warned that the Prime Minister’s stated objective of boosting exports and ultimately exiting the IMF programme cannot be achieved as long as industry continues to bear the burden of policies unrelated to its actual consumption or performance.
Rajput also expressed concern over the design of the current three-year incremental consumption package. He noted that while the previous winter package offered broad-based relief to industry, the current scheme is restrictive, excluding several industrial units particularly those whose electricity consumption was higher between December 2023 and November 2024.
He further criticised the load factors imposed by the Power Division, stating that there is no clear technical or regulatory justification for applying such benchmarks in a concessional package intended to stimulate electricity demand.
These parameters, he said, appear to have been borrowed from anti-theft and detection billing mechanisms, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the package.
Instead of encouraging additional consumption, the scheme risks merely shifting demand within the industrial sector.
The KATI president urged Federal Minister for Energy (Power Division) Sardar Awais Leghari to immediately remove cross-subsidy from industrial electricity bills and to undertake a comprehensive review of the incremental consumption package so that it genuinely supports increased industrial activity.
He said the future of industry, export competitiveness, and overall economic recovery is directly linked to fair, transparent, and rational electricity pricing.

The FTO has stopped Regional Tax Office (RTO) Islamabad from issuing any further coercive notices to Hazara Electric Supply Company Limited (HAZECO).
In this regard, the FTO has issued an order against FBR.
“Needless to emphasise, the instant complaint also represents a critical failure in the internal coordination and smacks of a blatant disregard for regulatory dispensations devised by FBR (HQ). Since the matter falls squarely in the administrative domain of Member Operations (IR), his indulgence is called for resolving the matter definitively,” the FTO order added.
The complaint was filed under Section 10(1) of the Federal Tax Ombudsman Ordinance 2000 (FTO Ordinance) primarily against RTO, Abbottabad for erroneously diverting the tax deduction for the month of September, 2025, amounting to Rs 180 million and additionally against CTO, Islamabad for initiating coercive measures through issuance of Show Cause notices in the name of senior officials of Hazara Electric Supply Company Limited.
Facts of the case are that the complainant is a registered electricity distribution company registered with CTO, Islamabad. HAZECO shoulders the responsibility of withholding tax under Section 235 of the ITO, 2001
on electricity bills of the consumers and subsequent deposit to the FBR as per procedure laid down in Circular of 2022. The complainant company routinely creates PSIDs and provides the same to its bankers through which the bank makes payment of tax withheld by the HAZECO to the FBR field formation i.e. Corporate Tax Office, Islamabad.
In line with the past practice, the HAZECO generated PSID u/s 235 for the month of September 2025 thereby crediting the payment to the Chief Commissioner, CTO, Islamabad. It was later discovered that the officials of RTO, Abbottabad exerted pressure on the bank authorities and managed to create another PSID misusing HAZECO particulars and submitted the same to the bank, thus diverting the amount of withheld taxes to RTO, Abbottabad.
Feeling aggrieved, the CTO, Islamabad issued multiple show cause notices to the senior officials of HAZECO for their alleged connivance in erroneously crediting the tax amount to the tune of Rs 180 million to RTO, Abbotabad. These acts on part of both the formations caused undue harassment and anxiety for the complainant. The HAZECO has also agitated against the issuance of repeated notices to its functionaries.
During the course of proceedings, it has emerged that the HAZECO stands registered with CTO, Islamabad. The Regional Tax Office Abbotabad has been incessantly vying to have the jurisdiction transferred to it on the premise that the Company is primarily carrying on its business ventures in Hazara Division and the entrustment of jurisdiction to RTO, Abbotabad would ensure proper monitoring and better realization of withholding taxes. The request is yet to be granted by the FBR (HQ).
Furthermore, both the field formations are relying on one instrument to justify their acts. Circular No. 01 of 2022, dated 01.07.2021 prescribes the dispensation of bifurcation of tax deducted between field formations.
The FTO has directed Member (Operations) to examine the matter and address the rift in consonance with Circular No. 01 of 2022.
The FBR will direct the chief commissioner CTO Islamabad to desist from issuing any further coercive notices to the complainant company and retract show cause notices already issued to HAZECO office holders, the FTO added.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402233/bqati-says-concerned-at-cross-subsidy-on-industrial-electricity-tariffs,BQATI says concerned at cross-subsidy on industrial electricity tariffs - Business Recorder,"KARACHI: Shakil Ashfaq, President of the Bin Qasim Association of Trade and Industry (BQATI), has expressed grave concern over the continued imposition of cross-subsidy on industrial electricity tariffs, stating that this policy is directly undermining industrial productivity, discouraging investment, and eroding Pakistan’s export competitiveness.
He noted that industrial electricity tariffs currently carry a cross-subsidy ranging from Rs 4.5 to Rs 7 per unit, adding nearly 20 percent to power costs that are already uncompetitive by regional standards. He stated that industry is no longer in a position to absorb this burden, and many industrial units are operating under extreme financial stress.
Shakil Ashfaq pointed out that despite having a broad base of small industrial units, Pakistan has failed to build and sustain large-scale industry—particularly in energy-intensive sectors operating in the Bin Qasim industrial zone. He emphasised that distorted and punitive electricity pricing discourages expansion, modernization, and long-term planning, forcing industries to remain small, underutilized, or unviable.
He further highlighted that the number of protected consumers has increased substantially in recent years. However, instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal measures, the government has chosen to recover the cost directly from industry. He termed this approach unfair and economically damaging, noting that industry has been treated as a convenient adjustment mechanism even while it faces declining demand, rising input costs, and persistent uncertainty.
Commenting on the Incremental Consumption Package, Shakil said the scheme suffers from serious design flaws and structural anomalies. He pointed out that industries which maintained higher electricity consumption during the reference period December 2023 to November 2024 have been declared ineligible, despite being consistent contributors to system demand.
He also questioned the load factors applied in the package, stating that they have no technical or regulatory basis for an incentive framework. He said these factors appear to be borrowed from theft and detection billing methodologies, which are meant for enforcement and not for incentivizing demand growth, adding that the package has therefore lost its intended purpose.
“This design will not increase overall electricity demand,” he warned. “It will only shift demand within the industrial sector, create artificial distortions, and reward behavior that has no connection to real economic productivity.”
Shakil Ashfaq also challenged repeated claims by the Power Ministry regarding improvements in the performance of the power sector. He stated that if the sector has genuinely improved, a competitive industrial tariff of around 9 cents per unit should already be achievable. The continued absence of such a tariff, he said, raises serious concerns about policy direction and priorities.
He urged the government to immediately remove cross-subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs, correct the anomalies in the Incremental Consumption Package, and align energy policy with the national objective of industrial growth rather than short-term revenue recovery.
He concluded by stating that Pakistan cannot achieve export expansion, employment generation, or economic stability while systematically weakening its productive sector. Unless these structural distortions are removed, industrial confidence will continue to erode and the economy will remain trapped in stagnation.

These included non-achievement of critical deliverables such as development of the integrated energy plan design, establishment of the Central Electrification Registry, institutionalization of strategic risk management, preparation of system value and tariff evaluation frameworks, operationalisation of MRV mechanism for GHG emissions, establishment of the R&D Secretariat, development of the Central Platform for R&D, initiation of minimum required R&D projects, and publishing of due-diligence and electrification reports within mandated timelines.
According to AGP, the lapse occurred due to insufficient institutional capacity, delays in staffing and operationalisation of PPMC, lack of a robust internal monitoring mechanism for tracking NEP deliverables, and inadequate coordination with CPPA-G and other sectoral stakeholders.
Furthermore, strategic planning functions were not fully established, resulting in weak implementation oversight and slow progress on mandated tasks. Failure to meet these NEP targets has resulted in delays in sectoral reforms, weakened progress toward national electrification, de-carbonization, risk management, and R&D institutionalization objectives, and compromised the Government’s ability to implement the National Action Plan (2023-27) within stipulated timelines.
“Inefficient performance resulted in non-achievement of key deliverables of the National Electricity Plan 2023-27 by designated entity PPMC upto the period 2024-25,” the AGP said adding that the matter was taken up with the management in December, 2025. No reply was received to date.
Audit has recommended that PPMC should immediately develop and implement a robust action plan to achieve all pending NEP 2023-27 deliverables within stipulated timelines. The Ministry of Energy (Power Division) should strengthen monitoring, reporting,
The AGP further stated that during audit of the accounts of MD, PPMC Islamabad for 2024-25, it was observed that despite the Cabinet’s approval to transfer the function of developing uniform designs, standards, and specifications (11kV and below) for distribution sector from NGC/NTDC to PPMC, and subsequent instructions by Power Division on 19.05.2025, the designated function was neither timely established nor fully operationalised.
The BoD in its meeting held on April 10,2025 approved the inclusion of the strategy energy Financing and Design and Standards functions within the organizational structure of PPMC and HR and Legal Committee in its 139th meeting of May 26, 2025 approved the 15 posts excluding support staff. However, delays persisted in deployment of technical HR, transfer of documentation, systems handover, and establishment of operational readiness. As a result, functional control over distribution design and specifications remained fragmented between NGC/NTDC and PPMC.
The AGP maintained that this delay, caused by inadequate follow-up after Cabinet approval, absence of a structured implementation roadmap, and slow migration of resources, has led to non-uniform technical standards across DISCOs, risks of procurement and design inconsistencies, potential quality deviations, and hindered achievement of the National Electricity Policy 2021 goal of a standardized, efficient, and optimized distribution system.

In a letter addressed to the minister, PALSP stated that with a current production capacity of 9 million tonnes, the long steel industry has the potential to consume around 7 billion units of electricity annually.
However, due to low capacity utilisation stemming from weak demand, the sector is presently consuming only 3 to 4 billion units per year.

“At a time when the country has surplus power generation capacity and is paying hundreds of billions of rupees in capacity payments, this challenge can be converted into a major opportunity.
Steel is an energy-intensive industry, and electricity is the second most important raw material in steelmaking,” the PALSP said.
The Association believed Pakistan can emulate China, which until recently exported surplus power indirectly by exporting steel after providing electricity to its steel industry at reduced rates.
PALSP suggested that a similar approach could be adopted locally by supplying power to the steel industry at lower costs—possibly at rates equivalent to those currently being paid in capacity payments.
Commenting on the government’s tariff rationalisation plan, the PALSP said that after enduring extreme hardships in recent years, the industry is now facing another major blow.
Instead of exploring ways to increase electricity consumption to reduce capacity payments, the Association feared that the government’s tariff rationalisation agenda may lead to the closure of steel plants in the coming years.
“This would not only result in a massive increase in capacity payments but would also lead to a sharp rise in electricity tariffs,” the Association warned.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402267/br-research-hidden-anomalies-in-electricity-tariff-setting,BR RESEARCH: Hidden anomalies in electricity tariff setting - Business Recorder,"NEPRA’s FY26 tariff decision shows a puzzling divergence between consumer classification, electricity consumption, and solar capacity estimates. On the residential side, the number of protected consumers rises to 21.5 million from 17 million in the government motion.
The largest increase is in the 101–200 kWh slab, now counting 12.53 million consumers. Total consumption for this slab remains 3.89 billion kWh, translating to about 26 kWh per household per month. This is far below the lower bound of the slab and suggests administrative reclassification or policy-driven inflation rather than actual usage.
Households in the 1–100 kWh category average 163 kWh per month, consistent with low-consumption behavior. The mismatch compresses per-consumer allocations and raises questions about fairness in subsidy targeting.
On the commercial front, numbers are more consistent. Nepra lists 3.52 million commercial consumers, up from 2.97 million in the motion.
Total consumption remains unchanged. This aligns with 3.5 million consumers recorded in the July 2025 base tariff, suggesting a routine reconciliation of records. The contrast shows that residential slab anomalies are likely due to methodology or policy choices rather than systemic errors.
The decision also addresses solarization. It cites a Power Planning & Monitoring Company (PPMC) report estimating 12,629 MW of off-grid solar capacity, in addition to 6,539 MW of net-metered installations, for a total of nearly 19,000 MW.
The report is not public, and the cut-off date is unclear. Import data suggests that cumulative solar panel imports already amount to around 50,000 MW, far higher than the official estimate.
It is also unclear whether behind-the-meter residential or commercial solar is included. Nepra assumes this capacity will generate nearly 30 billion kWh outside the grid, based on 4.5 hours of daily irradiation, and estimates the impact on base tariffs at Rs3.5 per unit.
The key risk is that underestimating off-grid and behind-the-meter solar could jeopardize demand-side planning and grid management. If actual capacity is far higher than official estimates, the base tariff and subsidy framework may fail to reflect true consumption patterns, distorting financial planning and resource allocation.
The anomalies in residential slabs and the underestimation of solar capacity point to deeper challenges in Pakistan’s electricity planning. Inflated consumer counts in higher protected slabs dilute actual subsidy coverage.
At the same time, official off-grid and behind-the-meter solar estimates fall far short of what import data suggest. This misalignment risks distorting tariff calculations, weakening demand-side management, and complicating grid operations.
Without clear methodology and public access to underlying data, policy decisions may be built on assumptions that do not reflect reality, leaving households, utilities, and planners exposed to unforeseen costs and operational stress.","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:06:55 GMT",,"NEPRA’s FY26 tariff decision shows a puzzling divergence between consumer classification, electricity consumption, and solar capacity estimates.

Gold and silver both jumpedto all-time highs, while oil flatlined on concerns about what an all-out trade war between the U.S. and Europe could mean for global growth and demand.
A holiday in U.S. equity and bond markets made for thin trading and likely contributed to a 0.8% drop in S&P 500 futures, and a 1.1% fall in Nasdaq futures.
For Europe, EUROSTOXX 50 futures and DAX futures both shed 1.3%, while FTSE futures lost 0.6%. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.4%, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.3%.
Trump said he would impose additional 10% import levies from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, rising to 25% on June 1 if no deal is reached.
Major European Union states decried the tariff threats over Greenland as blackmail, and France proposed responding with a range of previously untested economic countermeasures.
The EU’s options include a package of its own tariffs on 93 billion euros ($108 billion) of U.S. imports that was suspended for six months in early August and measures under an Anti-Coercion Instrument that could hit U.S. services trade or investments.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank noted European countries owned $8 trillion of U.S. bonds and equities, almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined, and might consider bringing some of that money back home.
“With the U.S. net international investment position at record negative extremes, the mutual interdependence of European-U.S. financial markets has never been higher,” said George Saravelos, Deutsche’s global head of FX research.
“It is a weaponization of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets.”
It should also make for a fraught few days at Davos as leaders from around the world gather at the World Economic Forum, including a large U.S. group led by Trump himself.

letters to the power regulator showed.
The groups said the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) move would unfairly penalise projects stalled for reasons beyond their control.
A CERC staff paper issued in November said more than 45 GW of renewable capacity currently holds grid connectivity based on letters of award but has not progressed to power purchase agreements, blocking transmission bays needed for new projects.
The paper proposed options such as auctioning surrendered capacity and deeming connectivity surrendered if PPAs remain unsigned for more than 12 months.
India aims to add 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but delays in project execution and transmission constraints have emerged as major hurdles.
The country’s transmission network — about 495,000 circuit kilometres — is struggling to keep pace with the rapid growth in renewable generation.
India backs states’ clean energy projects as federal agencies struggle with unsold power
The National Solar Energy Federation of India said auctioning vacated connectivity at a premium would raise tariffs and favour financially stronger players, arguing that grid access “cannot become a tradable commodity.”
It said delays in PPA signing stem largely from slow tariff adoption and approval processes at state distribution companies.
Wind-sector groups, including the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association and the Indian Wind Energy Association, said the proposed 18-month deadline to complete wind projects is unrealistic.
They noted that turbines and other equipment take long to manufacture and are often imported, adding to delays. They urged CERC to allow 24–30 months to complete projects instead of 18 months.
Government tendering agency Solar Energy Corporation of India also opposed premium-based auctions, warning they could inflate future tariffs.
The SECI suggested reallocating connectivity based on project readiness — land, financial closure and equipment status — rather than awarding it to the highest bidder.
Industry groups urged CERC to shift focus from penalizing developers to ensuring timely signing by working with the power and renewable-energy ministries.","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:08:33 GMT",,Wind-sector groups say proposed 18-month deadline to complete wind projects is unrealistic.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402448,Power sector: KCCI opposes proposed amendments to two laws - Business Recorder,"KARACHI: Referring to a news item appearing in a section of press, Acting President Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Raza expressed serious concern and strong opposition to the proposed amendments to the Nepra Act, 1997 and the Electricity Act, 1910, which indicated that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) may be placed under the administrative control of the Power Division.
Muhammad Raza stated that the proposed amendments effectively strike at the very foundation of regulatory independence, which is a universally accepted principle for ensuring transparency, predictability, and credibility in utility regulation.
He cautioned that placing Nepra under the direct influence of an executive ministry would compromise its ability to make impartial, technically sound, and cost-reflective decisions, thereby weakening confidence in Pakistan’s power sector governance framework.
He pointed out that independent regulators are established precisely to act as neutral arbiters between the government, utilities, investors, and consumers.
Any move that transforms Nepra into a subordinate body of the Power Division would not only undermine its authority but also raise serious concerns about politicisation of tariff determinations and regulatory decisions, which must remain insulated from short-term administrative or political pressures.
He warned that such amendments could severely damage investor confidence at a time when Pakistan desperately needs private sector participation to address chronic inefficiencies, mounting circular debt, and persistent capacity payment issues in the power sector.
He emphasised that investors require regulatory certainty and independence, and any perception of executive interference would deter fresh investment and increase the cost of capital for ongoing and future projects.
Muhammad Raza further stated that weakening Nepra’s autonomy would ultimately harm industrial and commercial consumers, who already face uncompetitive electricity tariffs and unreliable supply.
An independent regulator is essential to ensure fair scrutiny of costs, efficiency benchmarks, and service standards, whereas an administratively controlled regulator may be compelled to prioritise short-term fiscal or political considerations over long-term sector sustainability and consumer protection.
He also questioned the rationale behind the proposed amendments, noting that policy disagreements between a regulator and a ministry should be resolved through structured dialogue and institutional mechanisms, not by curtailing the regulator’s independence.
Such an approach, he said, sets a dangerous precedent and reverses years of reform efforts aimed at strengthening governance and accountability in the power sector.
Raza urged the government to immediately reconsider the proposed amendments and initiate comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders, including chambers of commerce, industry representatives, energy experts, and consumer bodies.
He stressed that Pakistan’s economic revival depends on transparent, credible, and independent institutions, and that weakening Nepra would be a regressive step with long-term negative consequences for the economy.

In a letter addressed to the minister, PALSP stated that with a current production capacity of 9 million tonnes, the long steel industry has the potential to consume around 7 billion units of electricity annually.
However, due to low capacity utilisation stemming from weak demand, the sector is presently consuming only 3 to 4 billion units per year.
READ MORE:PALSP says high energy tariffs brought steel sector to its knees
“At a time when the country has surplus power generation capacity and is paying hundreds of billions of rupees in capacity payments, this challenge can be converted into a major opportunity.
Steel is an energy-intensive industry, and electricity is the second most important raw material in steelmaking,” the PALSP said.
The Association believed Pakistan can emulate China, which until recently exported surplus power indirectly by exporting steel after providing electricity to its steel industry at reduced rates.
PALSP suggested that a similar approach could be adopted locally by supplying power to the steel industry at lower costs—possibly at rates equivalent to those currently being paid in capacity payments.
Commenting on the government’s tariff rationalisation plan, the PALSP said that after enduring extreme hardships in recent years, the industry is now facing another major blow.
Instead of exploring ways to increase electricity consumption to reduce capacity payments, the Association feared that the government’s tariff rationalisation agenda may lead to the closure of steel plants in the coming years.
“This would not only result in a massive increase in capacity payments but would also lead to a sharp rise in electricity tariffs,” the Association warned.

Speaking in the context of the NEPRA tariff rebasing hearing, Ejaz highlighted that the power sector will require a staggering Rs 629 billion in subsidies, while the government has allocated only Rs 248 billion. The remaining gap, he said, is being unfairly bridged through cross-subsidisation, with industry bearing the heaviest burden.
READ MORE:Industrial, export-oriented consumers: Imposition of Rs130bn cross-subsidy opposed
“This is nothing short of a hidden tax on industry,” Ejaz said. “The government is not paying its share, so industry is being forced to subsidise other consumer categories. This has made Pakistani industry uncompetitive, both regionally and globally.”
According to Ejaz, if industrial consumers were charged purely on cost-of-service principles—without cross-subsidies—electricity tariffs for industry would be close to 9 US cents per unit even today, despite inefficiencies, governance failures, and systemic losses in the power sector.
He warned that persistently high energy prices are choking industrial activity, leading to plant shutdowns, declining exports, and job losses across the country.
“It is the industrial sector that is subsidising other consumers on behalf of the government. This model is unsustainable.”
Ejaz posed a stark question to policymakers: What happens when industry collapses?
“If factories shut down, who will employ millions of industrial workers? Who will earn the foreign exchange needed to keep the economy afloat?” he asked.
He stressed that cross-subsidy policies are economically destructive, eroding Pakistan’s manufacturing base and accelerating de-industrialisation.

Calling for urgent reform, Ejaz urged the government to fully fund power sector subsidies transparently through the federal budget, end cross-subsidisation that penalises productive sectors, reduce inefficiencies and losses in distribution companies and align industrial energy tariffs with regional competitors.
“Industry cannot and will not carry the power sector’s burden any longer,” Ejaz concluded. “If Pakistan is serious about growth, exports, and employment, it must stop treating industry as an endless source of revenue to cover policy failures.”","Tue, 13 Jan 2026 08:00:04 GMT",,"Pakistan’s industrial sector is being pushed to the brink by an unjust electricity pricing regime.
