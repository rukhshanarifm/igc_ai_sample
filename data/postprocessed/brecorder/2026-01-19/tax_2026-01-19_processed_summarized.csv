https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402675,Provincial revenue potential largely untapped: Shehzad - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’ provincial revenue potential remains largely untapped, and claims that provinces have outperformed the federal government on tax collection do not stand up to a factual review, said Khurram Shehzad, Advisor to the Finance Minister.
“The debate on fiscal federalism must be anchored in measured outcomes, not perceptions,” Shehzad said, pointing to wide disparities between federal and provincial tax effort despite provinces holding major constitutionally assigned tax bases.
He shared details with media noting that in fiscal year 2025 the federal government collected over Rs 13 trillion, equivalent to 11.3 percent of GDP, placing Pakistan on a trajectory to reach the 15 percent federal tax-to-GDP benchmark by June 2028. For countries at Pakistan’s level of development, total tax revenue of around 18 percent of GDP is considered normal, with the balance expected from provincial and state governments.
By contrast, all provinces combined collected just Rs 979 billion in fiscal year 2025, or 0.85 percent of GDP. “Provinces are expected to contribute around 3 percent of GDP. To get there by 2028, collections will need to more than triple,” Shehzad said.
According to him, the core problem is not the absence of a tax base, but weak revenue yield from existing bases.
On sales tax, Shehzad highlighted that services — a provincial subject — have an estimated taxable base of Rs 29 trillion, yet provinces collected only Rs 650 billion, a yield of 2.2 percent. In contrast, sales tax on goods — a federal subject — generated Rs 3.9 trillion from a Rs 30 trillion base, a yield of around 13 percent.
“This gap alone shows the difference in collection efficiency,” he said.
The picture is even starker in agricultural income tax, also a provincial responsibility. Despite an estimated taxable base of Rs 3.7 trillion, provinces collected just Rs 8.4 billion, a yield of 0.2 percent.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402119/pakistans-gdp-growth-expected-to-stay-at-3-world-bank,Pakistan’s GDP growth expected to stay at 3%: World Bank - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s GDP growth is projected to remain at 3 percent in fiscal year 2025–26 before rising to 3.4 percent in fiscal year 2026–27, driven by a recovery in agricultural production and reconstruction efforts following a series of floods in 2025, the World Bank said.
However, Pakistan current account deficit is expected to widen in fiscal year 2026-27, with a rise in import demand, alongside the strengthening growth, and post-flood normalization of remittance inflows, the Bank stated in its latest report on Global Economic Prospects.
The Bank has also warned that in several oil importers, particularly Pakistan and Tunisia, further increases in US tariffs could lead to notable declines in exports. In addition, economies with a more concentrated export destination structure would be more vulnerable to trade related shocks.
READ MORE:Pakistan’s exports as share of GDP shrinking: World Bank
The report further stated that in Morocco and Pakistan, the implementation of deeper-than-anticipated regulatory reforms to promote private sector activity could boost growth, reduce informality, and create jobs.
In Pakistan, a relaxation of import restrictions and an expansion of bank credit, stemming partly from easing financial conditions, have contributed to the strengthening of activity, particularly in the industrial sector.
Among oil importers, current account balances have improved in Morocco, Pakistan, and Tunisia, partly because of increases in remittances and tourism revenues, it added.
Among oil importers, inflation has declined, particularly on account of softening food prices. This has led to multiple policy rate cuts, including in Pakistan, though monetary policies have still remained restrictive to tame inflation in several economies, the Bank added.
The report noted that the global economy is proving more resilient than anticipated despite persistent trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Global growth is projected to remain broadly steady over the next two years, easing to 2.6% in 2026 before rising to 2.7% in 2027, an upward revision from the June forecast.
The resilience reflects better-than-expected growth—especially in the United States, which accounts for about two-thirds of the upward revision to the forecast in 2026. Even so, if these forecasts hold, the 2020s are on track to be the weakest decade for global growth since the 1960s.
The sluggish pace is widening the gap in living standards across the world, the report finds: at the end of 2025, nearly all advanced economies enjoyed per capita incomes exceeding their 2019 levels, but about one in four developing economies had lower per capita incomes.
In 2025, growth was supported by a surge in trade ahead of policy changes and swift readjustments in global supply chains. These boosts are expected to fade in 2026 as trade and domestic demand soften.
However, the easing global financial conditions and fiscal expansion in several large economies should help cushion the slowdown, according to the report. Global inflation is projected to edge down to 2.6% in 2026, reflecting softer labour markets and lower energy prices.
Growth is expected to pick up in 2027 as trade flows adjust and policy uncertainty diminishes.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.3% higher at 4,114, recovering some ground following a four-day losing streak.
The blue-chip CSI300 Index edged up less than 0.1% after swinging between gains and losses during the day.
Fresh data released on Monday showed China’s economic growth slowed to a three-year low of 4.5% last quarter as domestic demand softened. GDP growth, however, showed resilience in 2025 overall, with the full-year pace meeting the official target.
The data came after China’s central bank last week cut sector-specific interest rates, while keeping the door open for further reductions in banks’ cash reserve requirements and broader rate cuts in an early effort to boost demand.
“Today’s economic data really wasn’t a positive surprise,” said Dickie Wong, head of research at uSmart Securities in Hong Kong. “But since the PBOC had already made it clear that there’s still room for RRR cuts, they’re basically giving everyone reassurance. We’ll just have to see what they do going forward.”
The relatively steady start to the week follows last week’s declines, which snapped a start-of-the-year bull run after Beijing moved to cool sentiment.
China’s securities regulator vowed on Friday to step up market monitoring and crack down on excessive speculation, after major bourses said that they would raise the minimum margin requirement for new borrowings to 100% from 80%.
Market consensus now is that Beijing wants to focus on supporting the real economy and consumption as geopolitical uncertainties remain, while taking some heat off frothy sectors to cool market sentiment before it gets out of hand, Wong said.

Since the launch of the first plan in 1953, these policy blueprints have guided the country from socialist industrialization to export-led growth and mass urbanization.
Uniquely, China remains the only major economy to have successfully completed every Five-Year Plan with broadly achieved objectives. As Beijing prepares for the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026–2030), the shift underway carries profound implications not only for China’s future development but also for the global political economy.
For much of the reform era, particularly during the 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans, China pursued high-speed growth driven by heavy investment, industrial expansion, and exports. This model delivered extraordinary results, including sustained double-digit GDP growth and China’s rise as the world’s manufacturing hub.
The 13th Plan began acknowledging a “new normal” of slower growth, yet quantitative expansion remained central. By the late 2010s, however, structural constraints—overcapacity, environmental degradation, declining investment returns, demographic pressures, and intensifying geopolitical competition—made a strategic recalibration unavoidable.
The turning point came with the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025), which marked a decisive move away from growth at all costs. Notably, it avoided setting a rigid GDP growth target and instead elevated the concept of “high-quality development.”
Innovation, technological self-reliance, environmental sustainability, and social equity replaced sheer expansion as policy priorities. The emphasis on supply-chain security and the “dual circulation” strategy reflected China’s response to global uncertainty and external pressures.
The forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan builds on this transformation. Covering the period from 2026 to 2030, it represents a critical phase in China’s long-term goal of basically achieving socialist modernization by 2035. The plan is expected to consolidate China’s shift toward an innovation-led, resilient, and people-centered economy, focusing on quality rather than speed of growth.
Technological self-reliance will be a central pillar. China aims to strengthen indigenous innovation in strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum technology, bio manufacturing, hydrogen energy, and space industries. This drive is designed to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and foreign restrictions, but it also has global implications, particularly as technological competition with Western economies intensifies.
Equally significant is the plan’s strong commitment to green development. China has already emerged as the world’s largest investor in renewable energy, accounting for a substantial share of global solar and wind capacity additions. The 15th Plan is expected to further integrate ecological protection, clean energy, and low-carbon industrial systems into economic planning, aligning growth with climate responsibility.
Social modernization is another defining feature. Building on the vision of “common prosperity,” the plan emphasizes rural revitalisation, urban renewal, demographic resilience, and improved social welfare. By strengthening domestic consumption and reducing regional disparities, China seeks to create a more balanced and inclusive development model.
Beyond its domestic agenda, the 15th Five-Year Plan carries wide international significance. It reinforces China’s intention to remain engaged with the global economy while reshaping globalisation through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development, Security, Civilisation, and Governance Initiatives.
For developing regions in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa, the plan signals a shift toward higher quality, sustainable, and innovation-oriented cooperation.
For countries like Pakistan, this presents both opportunities and challenges. Chinese investment can support infrastructure development, industrial upgrading, and energy transition. At the same time, it underscores the need for careful policy choices to ensure economic sustainability, strategic balance, and long-term national interests.
Ultimately, China’s 15th Five-Year Plan symbolizes a historic transition—from rapid catch-up growth to qualitative, innovation-driven, and environmentally conscious modernization. Its success will shape not only China’s internal resilience and technological leadership but also the future contours of global trade, innovation, and development. As such, the plan deserves close attention well beyond China’s borders.

The Bank also proposed a results-based approach anchored in clear policy milestones, measurable performance indicators, and targeted technical assistance to accelerate implementation and unlock investment
Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Muhammad Aurangzeb, held a meeting on Thursday with Bolormaa Amgaabazar, Country Director, World Bank Pakistan, along with their respective teams, to review ongoing collaboration and discuss priority areas under the World Bank’s CPF with Pakistan.
READ MORE:PM vows to implement World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework
According to the CPF, boosting productive private investment is central to significantly raising Pakistan’s investment-to-GDP ratio over the next decade. Deep-rooted policy and institutional weaknesses—marked by excessive controls, subsidies, taxes, trade protection, and the dominant role of SOEs — have suppressed productivity, investment, and export competitiveness.
As a result, private investment remains stuck at around 10 percent of GDP, far below 20–25 percent in India and Bangladesh, while exports have declined from 16 percent of GDP in the 1990s to about 10 percent today.
The WBG aims to tackle these structural constraints by supporting a shift toward a more open, export-led growth model. With an estimated additional $60 billion in annual export potential, realizing this opportunity will depend on decisive improvements in the business environment.
The World Bank team briefed the Finance Minister on the progress of ongoing operations and projects under the CPF, including recent developments in fiscal and revenue reforms, macroeconomic stabilisation efforts, and policy-based engagements.
Both sides acknowledged that Pakistan has made progress toward macroeconomic stability through prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and emphasized the need to translate this stability into sustained economic growth, higher investment, and job creation.
The discussion focused on designing a coherent, programmatic investment framework aligned with CPF objectives, covering business environment reforms, state-owned enterprise reforms, trade facilitation, capital market development, and export competitiveness.
Aurangzeb underscored the government’s commitment to structural reforms already underway, including tariff rationalisation, improved SOE governance, regulatory modernisation, and transparency initiatives.
He also emphasized the importance of deepening capital markets, expanding access to long-term finance, and strengthening institutional coordination to support private sector–led growth.
The meeting also discussed employment and skills development as a critical pillar of economic growth.
The Finance Minister highlighted the need for market-driven vocational and technical training, closer public-private collaboration, and alignment of skills development with domestic and overseas labour market demand, particularly in sectors such as IT, healthcare, nursing, hospitality, and construction.
The World Bank shared its ongoing work on labour mobility, skills matching, and digital labour market platforms to enhance workforce productivity and overseas employment opportunities.
Sectoral priorities including digital services exports, agriculture and agribusiness, minerals and mining, healthcare, and selected manufacturing segments were also discussed as potential focus areas for future World Bank-supported operations. Both sides agreed that targeted sectoral interventions, supported by regulatory and institutional reforms, could generate high-impact employment and export growth.
The World Bank also briefed the Finance Minister on the potential use of policy-based guarantees as part of future operations to support Pakistan’s liability management, refinancing of high-cost debt, and innovative financing approaches, subject to achievement of agreed policy milestones.
Climate finance, regulatory streamlining, and coordination with provincial governments were also discussed in the broader context of development financing and reform implementation.
Both sides agreed to continue technical-level engagements to further refine priorities, narrow the scope of proposed interventions, and advance preparation of future World Bank-supported programs in line with Pakistan’s reform agenda and the objectives of the Country Partnership Framework.

Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry shared the figures on Friday.
Commenting on data released by the Marine Fisheries Department, the minister said the performance reflects the growing competitiveness of Pakistan’s marine fisheries in global markets, noting sustained export momentum throughout the period.
Compared with the corresponding period of FY2024–25, when exports stood at 102,942.05 metric tons worth $208.25 million, the sector recorded a year-on-year increase of 19.1% in volume and 21.6% in value.
The minister described fisheries as a vital pillar of the national maritime economy, supporting hundreds of thousands of livelihoods in coastal communities along the Arabian Sea, particularly in Sindh and Balochistan.
“Historically contributing around one percent to GDP, the sector has rebounded from pandemic-era disruptions through expanded processing capacity, improved cold-chain logistics, and stricter certification aligned with international standards,” he said.
According to the data, frozen fish remained the leading export category, accounting for 26,669.37 metric tons valued at $53.33 million. Shrimps and prawns followed with earnings of $40.46 million, while frozen cuttlefish generated $36.13 million.
Other products, including shrimp meal, crabs, sardines, mackerel, flatfish species, and fish meal, also contributed to higher export receipts, underscoring diversification and growth in value-added processing.
China retained its position as Pakistan’s largest export destination, importing more than 83,602 metric tons worth $149.2 million, i.e. nearly 59% of total seafood exports, driven by steady demand for high-quality frozen products.
Thailand ranked second with imports valued at $31.3 million, mainly shrimps and prawns, supported by Pakistan’s HACCP-certified processing standards.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Malaysia, and Japan followed, with rising shipments of cuttlefish and fish meal.
The minister added that market diversification efforts have also expanded exports to the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Kuwait, and the United States.
Monthly export figures showed consistent growth, peaking at $56.42 million in November and $55 million in December, aided by seasonal demand and logistical improvements. Non-tax revenue from the fisheries sectors also increased to Rs127.7 million (approximately $460,000), up from Rs118 million in 2025.
READ MORE:Seafood exports to EU states unlikely to resume next year
Chaudhry attributed the gains to government initiatives under the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, including collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on sustainable fishing practices and investments in port infrastructure at Karachi and Gwadar.
“These developments signal the fisheries sector’s rising contribution to foreign exchange earnings and economic stability,” he said, while stressing the need for strict regulatory compliance and sustainable fishing to protect marine biodiversity.
He acknowledged ongoing challenges such as climate-related impacts on migratory species, but noted that emerging tools like eDNA monitoring and broader blue economy strategies are gaining momentum as Pakistan aligns with IMO conventions and strengthens regional cooperation.","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:23:37 GMT",,"Marine fisheries sector posted strong growth in the first half of fiscal year 2025–26. seafood exports rose to 122,629.11 metric tons valued at $253.24 million.

Syed Fakhar Jehan further stated that during the next six months, revenue figures reported by various Excise offices and districts must show a significant increase, enabling the department to contribute additional income to the government exchequer beyond the prescribed annual targets.
It was decided in the meeting that monthly performance review meetings would be held under the chairmanship of the Secretary Excise, while the provincial minister will personally review tax collection progress again in April.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402603/editorial-export-emergency-awareness-is-first-step-towards-resolution,EDITORIAL: Export emergency: awareness is first step towards resolution - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal announced the imposition of an “Export Emergency” in the country entailing the creation of a special cell in the Prime Minister’s Office to address problems and constraints facing the business community on an urgent basis with the objective of increasing exports by 40 percent in four years and 200 percent by 2035.
His statement reflects an awareness of a decline in exports leading to a rise in the trade deficit during the first half of the current year against the same period the year before — negative USD 19,204 million as opposed to negative USD 14,271 million — which implies that the reliance on foreign borrowing, including rollovers from friendly countries, borrowing from bilaterals and multilaterals, to shore up foreign exchange reserves continues unabated.
Awareness of a problem is the first step towards its resolution and requires sector experts/stakeholders to delve into the causes of the problem and formulate a set of remedial measures designed to resolve it in the short, medium and ideally long term.
There is a plethora of empirical research gathering dust in government offices that highlights the reasons behind Pakistan’s cyclical economic volatility.
The October 2024 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report titled Request for an Extended Fund Arrangement reiterated the crux of the problem notably “economic volatility has only increased over time, with a tight correlation between Pakistan’s boom-bust economic outcomes and its macroeconomic policies.” The report, disturbingly, added that “compared to nine other regional peers, the country’s export growth since 2000 has been second to last, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.
READ MORE:BR RESEARCH: Pakistan’s export performance: the emergency reflex
The country’s trade restrictions (including exchange measures, tariff and non-tariff barriers, restrictions to payments, etc.) have placed it consistently at or around the 90th percentile of the highest Measurement of Aggregate Trade Restrictions index…. This high level of protection has not helped improve, and likely undermined, Pakistan’s competitiveness.” One can only hope that the export emergency cell would take cognizance of these observations and not repeat past mistakes which have been to extend monetary and fiscal subsidies to specific influential sectors with the objective of increasing exports, which would reactivate the boom-bust syndrome.
While setting up an export emergency cell in the PM Office indicates that that the government has elevated it at the highest executive level, thereby facilitating appropriate policy decisions promptly, there is a need to carefully review the pledges made by the economic team leaders to the Fund — pledges that if not met may not only lead to a cessation of the next tranche release but as has been evident since 2019 may lead to the three friendly countries refusing to roll over 12 billion dollars to another year.
The Fund’s advice is implicit in its observation: “with an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles, the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products. Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors.” In other words, structural reforms are required that do not consist of monetary or fiscal incentives or setting up special economic zones, that the government has pledged to phase out and not announce any new ones but to end all existing economic distortions.
If past precedence is anything to go by an ‘export emergency cell’ will undertake measures that would bring it in conflict with pledges made to the IMF. To increase our leverage with the Fund would require taking measures that would be supported by the Fund and include ending the energy cross-subsidy paid for by industry, reducing current expenditure to create fiscal space that would ease the vise-like application of the Federal Board of Revenue’s audit function being described as harassment by industry, end red tape implicit in any new venture and end the elite capture of both budgeted resources as well as outlay.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402730/we-enter-the-new-year-with-the-same-old-burdens,We enter the New Year with the same old burdens - Business Recorder,"We enter the New Year not with renewal, but with remembrance – remembrance of the same problems, the same pains, the same untold miseries that have stalked this land for decades. Time has moved forward, calendars have changed, and digits have been replaced, yet nothing fundamental has changed in the lived reality of the people. We transport ourselves into the New Year carrying all our past baggage – old wounds, festering injustices, and unfulfilled promises – still crying out for improvement, reforms, good governance, an end to cancerous corruption, and relief from elite capture that continues to destroy the very fabric of our society.
The illusion of change collapses when confronted with facts.
Our rulers peddle an official unemployment rate of around 7 percent, projecting an image of relative stability. Yet renowned and independent economists place real unemployment closer to 22 percent, exposing a massive gap between official narratives and lived reality. Each year, over 22 million young people enter the labour force, hopeful yet increasingly disillusioned, only to find shrinking opportunities and closed doors. This youth bulge, instead of becoming a demographic dividend, is fast turning into a social and economic time bomb.
Hunger, meanwhile, stalks millions. More than 8 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, unsure where their next meal will come from. Among children, the crisis is even more heartbreaking. Around 38 percent suffer from stunted growth, a permanent scar of malnutrition that impairs physical and cognitive development. These are not mere statistics; they are lifelong sentences imposed on innocence.
Education – the most powerful instrument of social mobility – stands in ruins. Shamefully, Pakistan has one of the lowest literacy rates in South Asia. Over 25 million children are out of school, while the Pakistan Institute of Education reports that around 20 million children have never attended school at all. Millions of these children, instead of spending their formative years learning, playing, and dreaming, are forced into garages, hotels, workshops, shops, and menial labour to support families crushed by poverty. Their stolen childhoods are the most damning indictment of our governance failures.
Healthcare paints an equally grim picture. Our health system is overwhelmed and under-resourced, struggling to cope with both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Public hospitals are massively flooded with ailing souls, lacking beds, medicines, equipment, and trained staff. The poor village women carrying the emaciated babies in their laps roam from pillar to post for the scarce medicines and absentee doctors. For the poor and have-nots, illness often becomes a death sentence or a descent into irreversible debt. Preventive healthcare remains neglected, while private care is prohibitively expensive, pushing medical treatment beyond the reach of the common citizen. The common man – the very soul and architect of Pakistan – remains trapped in a cycle of poverty, injustice and betrayal.
Infrastructure, the backbone of any functional state, is crippling and collapsing. Vast segments of the population still lack proper sanitation and sewage systems, living amid filth that breeds disease and indignity. Roads crumble, water systems fail, electricity remains unreliable, and urban planning is almost non-existent. These failures are not accidents; they are the result of years of neglect, corruption, and misplaced priorities.
Justice, too, remains elusive. Cases crawl through courts for years, even decades, making justice expensive, exhausting, and inaccessible for ordinary citizens. The poor suffer delays; the powerful exploit loopholes. At the grassroots, our police stations – the thanas – are often governed not by law, but by connections and currency, further eroding public trust in the state.
Inflation continues to perish and break the bones of the people, relentlessly eroding purchasing power and dignity. Even as official figures fluctuate, the cost of food, fuel, utilities, and basic necessities keeps ordinary families in a permanent state of anxiety. Survival itself has become a daily struggle.
And towering over all these crises is the mountain of debt. Better not to speak of it – yet we must. Billions are borrowed annually to build infrastructure and improve the lot of commoners – yet the lives of multitudes remain untouched by progress. Flood water turns towns and cities into lakes, yet the state services are visibly absent. Pakistan today stands drowning in debt of around Rs. 80.6 trillion, translating into a burden of approximately Rs. 318,252 on every citizen. Each passing day adds to these fetters, tightening the noose around the nation’s economic sovereignty. Debt servicing consumes resources that should have built schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, while wasteful administration and discretionary expenditures show no signs of austerity or restraint.
Most painfully, our public representatives, intoxicated by rhetoric, continue to raise their perks and privileges, even as they sermonize about reforms, good governance, ending elite capture, and curing the monster of corruption. The contradiction is glaring, the hypocrisy staggering. Why are we still here with birthday problems? Nations that rose from ashes – Germany, Japan, South Korea – stand as titans. Even Bangladesh once poorer out spaces us in growth. Let them think today to steer us out of crises and transport us to new year with new resolve and commitment to alleviate our suffering and festering problems of past years.
In such circumstances, we have little to cherish as we step into the New Year. We enter it with old stories, old scars, and a mountain of unresolved crises. Yet, despite everything, the people do not surrender hope. They carry a fragile but persistent optimism – the belief that the New Year might finally bring departure from destructive past practices and a genuine turn toward reform.
What the people seek is not charity, but justice. Not slogans, but structural change. They yearn for real efforts by those in power to pull the country out of debilitating poverty, staggering unemployment, crippling inflation, and drowning debt. They aspire to a future with quality education, decent employment, functioning healthcare, resilient infrastructure, better law and order, and above all, dignity, honour, and respect – the hallmarks of a civilized, independent, and honourable nation.
Only then will a New Year carry true fragrance – not merely of a changed digit, but of changed lives. Only then will the promise of a new horizon cease to be poetic rhetoric and become lived reality. Until that day, the people will continue to step into each New Year burdened, bruised, yet unbroken – still hoping that time will one day move not just forward, but towards justice.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402372/beyond-the-baraat-weddings-generated-rs33bn-for-karachis-economy-in-2025,Beyond the Baraat: weddings generated Rs33bn for Karachi’s economy in 2025 - Business Recorder,"The marriage industry has evolved into a key economic contributor in Pakistan, generating nearly Rs33 billion during this winter seasonin economic activity from weddings held in Karachi alone, according to one estimate.
This figure represents only the direct industries associated with wedding ceremonies, which include banquet halls, catering services, ready-made garments, as well as transportation costs.
It has been obtained through calculation: the total number of banquets in Karachi are about 800, and the occupancy rate was 70%. This means that 560 weddings took place in one day. If we multiply 560 by 60, the number comes out to be 33,600. Since 600 halls are located in middle-class or lower-middle-class localities, the average expense per wedding has been figure out Rs1million. In this way, the total amount comes to around Rs33 billion.
According to Rana Rais Ahmed, president of the All Karachi Marriage Hall Lawn Banquet Owner Association, the number of direct industries involved in wedding ceremonies ranges from 80 to 100, while the number of allied industries is approximately 250, including the construction industry.
“Although a wedding appears to be just an event, there are around 250 industries associated with it. Direct industries include catering, flowers, banquets, and men’s and women’s clothing, while indirect industries also include the construction sector, because before weddings people often renovate or build” Ahmed said.
While speaking toBusiness Recorder, the president said from March 2025 until around November, the wedding season was almost negligible. However, the season performed well in December and January, with hall occupancy reaching up to 70%.
He explained that until a few years ago, people scheduled weddings according to the Islamic calendar, but now the trend has changed. There is a preference for winter months for several reasons. In the 1980s and 1990s there were very few Pakistani families living abroad, but now their number has increased significantly, and they return to Pakistan during the December-January holidays. Other reasons include better weather and the fact that children are on holidays from school.When asked about the growing trend of daytime weddings in Karachi, the president said that the main reason is that halls can cost up to 50% less and are more easily available. In 2025 there were more daytime wedding events than in the past five years.
Karachi has a total of 800 halls, about 600 of which are located in Orangi, Korangi, Surjani, PIB Colony, and surrounding areas. The remaining hubs are situated along Shahrah-e-Faisal, Bahadurabad, Gulistan-e-Jauhar, and Sakhi Hassan, according to Ahmed.
He also said the concept of wedding event management is rapidly gaining ground, gradually replacing traditional methods of organizing marriages. This growing trend reflects changing social preferences, time constraints, and a desire for more personalized and well-organised wedding experiences.
Izzah Zaman, the CEO of event planning marketplaceShadiyana, toldBusiness Recorderdemand for services is spread fairly evenly across income groups.Between October and December 2025, event management companies recorded an almost 25% increase in desktop-based queries, indicating that users are taking time to research vendors, pricing, and availability - a sign that event planning behaviour is evolving.
Zaman has noticed a reduction in average guest counts. She said currently the average guest counts during the December–January wedding season stood at approximately 249, with a noticeable preference for more intimate and personalized events.
“However, this shift does not necessarily translate into lower overall wedding spending. In many cases, spending is being reallocated towards experience, quality, and personalization. Given this nuance, it would be difficult to make a definitive claim that wedding budgets have reduced overall”, the CEO said.","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:31:36 GMT",,"Weddings in Karachi generated nearly Rs33 billion in economic activity this winter.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402685/venezuela-opposition-leader-sees-eventual-elections-but-cautions-about-complex-path-ahead,Venezuela opposition leader sees eventual elections but cautions about complex path ahead - Business Recorder,"WASHINGTON: Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said on Friday she was confident that the remnants of what she called Venezuela’s “criminal regime” would eventually be dismantled and there would be an orderly transition to free elections, but cautioned that the road ahead would be difficult and complex.
Machado spoke to reporters a day after meeting President Donald Trump at the White House, where she presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to him as she sought to sway him to give the opposition a role in determining Venezuela’s future after the U.S. ousted longtime leader Nicolas Maduro.
Trump has backed former Maduro loyalists, led by interim President Delcy Rodriguez, to govern the OPEC nation for now instead of Machado, whose movement was widely seen as the legitimate winner of the 2024 election that Maduro was accused of rigging.
CONFIDENT OF ORDERLY MOVE TO ELECTIONS
Since the January 3 lightning raid that toppled Maduro, Trump has prioritized gaining access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, not restoring democracy to Venezuela, and made clear he sees the current leadership as the best bet for maintaining order.
Machado’s visit to Washington has done little to clarify any role she may have in the changes under way in Venezuela. She said she insisted in her meeting with Trump on returning to Venezuela as soon as possible, but cited no tangible agreements with the U.S.
Venezuela acting president, opposition leader navigate new relations with Trump administration
Despite signs of the Trump administration deepening ties with Maduro’s government, Machado gave a mostly upbeat assessment.
“I am profoundly, profoundly confident that we will have an orderly transition (to elections),” she told a press conference, but stressed that the process would take time to unfold.
“This has nothing to do with tension or relations between Delcy Rodriguez and myself,” she said, but insisted that a “criminal structure” that has dominated Venezuela for years would eventually dismantle itself. She did not elaborate on how this would happen.
Machado branded Venezuela’s new leader a “communist” and said Rodriguez is afraid of Trump and holds an unsustainable position as head of a system that is “repressive” but does not include the military.
Rodriguez’s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CIA DIRECTOR MEETS RODRIGUEZ
Coinciding with Machado’s White House visit on Thursday, CIA Director John Ratcliffe flew to Caracas, the highest-level known U.S. visit since the toppling of Maduro and another sign of the two sides jockeying for favor with the Trump administration. In a photo circulating on social media, the two shook hands surrounded by several people, with Rodriguez wearing a bright green pantsuit and sneakers.
Trump to host Venezuelan opposition leader sidelined by US
Machado expressed gratitude to Trump and avoided any direct criticism of his approach to post-Maduro Venezuela, which has frustrated many in the country’s opposition.
Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Machado was a “wonderful woman who has been through so much” and that giving him her Nobel Peace Prize medal was “a wonderful gesture of mutual respect.” The White House later posted a photo of Trump, alongside Machado, holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.
SEEKING TRUMP’S FAVOR
Machado’s attempt to win Trump’s favor in their first face-to-face meeting came after he dismissed the idea of installing her as Venezuela’s leader to replace Maduro, who was whisked away to New York to face prosecution on “narco-trafficking” charges.
During the visit, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump stood by his “realistic” assessment that Machado did not currently have the support needed to lead the country in the short term.
While declining to offer details of her discussions with Trump, Machado acknowledged “there may be some phase that we hadn’t anticipated or that we don’t like.” But she asserted that the opposition was participating in Venezuela’s transition, without offering specifics.
Machado, who fled the South American nation in a daring seaborne escape in December, is competing for Trump’s ear with members of Venezuela’s government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.
Trump says no more Venezuelan oil, money to go to Cuba
Trump has on several occasions praised Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, and told Reuters on Wednesday, “She’s been very good to deal with.”
Ratcliffe met with Rodriguez at Trump’s direction “to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship,” according to a U.S. official.
The two discussed intelligence cooperation, economic stability and the need to ensure Venezuela was no longer a “safe haven for America’s adversaries, especially narco-traffickers,” according to the U.S. official.
Machado was banned from running in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election by a top court stacked with Maduro allies, and went into hiding.
Outside observers widely believe Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition figure backed by Machado, won by a substantial margin, but Maduro claimed victory.
Many Machado and Gonzalez allies were jailed in the fallout of the election, with rights group Foro Penal estimating about 800 political prisoners in the country. Among them is Rafael Tudares, the husband of Gonzalez’s daughter Mariana Gonzalez, who was detained in January 2025. Mariana Gonzalez said on Friday that authorities allowed her to speak with Tudares for 25 minutes through a panel of bulletproof glass, and she found him in poor health.
“Rafael was visibly affected, both physically and emotionally,” she said in a social media post. “Isolation and being kept away from his children are not human conditions for anyone.”
In an annual address to lawmakers on Thursday, Rodriguez called for diplomacy with the United States and said that should she need to travel to Washington, she would do so “walking on her feet, not dragged there.”
She also said she would propose reforms to her country’s oil industry aimed at increasing access for foreign investors. The potential shift comes as international oil companies are lobbying for changes in Venezuelan law that would give them the right to freely export oil produced in the country.","Sat, 17 Jan 2026 06:15:03 GMT",,"Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado spoke to reporters a day after meeting President Donald Trump at the White House.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402179,Multi-million-dollar makeover planned for Karachi’s Ziarat Hasan Shah Island - Business Recorder,"Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry announced plans to transform Ziarat Hasan Shah Island into a modern hub for eco-tourism, sports tourism, and lifestyle retreats, balancing environmental sustainability with long-term economic gains.
According to a statement on Wednesday, the federal minister, while chairing a meeting, said the island project, estimated to cost between Rs1-1.5 billion ($3.6–5.3 million), has been designated an investment priority and is expected to generate significant employment opportunities.
“Based on the project’s scale and cost, it is projected to create around 1,000 to 1,500 direct and indirect jobs during the construction phase, followed by 1,200 to 1,800 sustainable jobs once operations begin,”
He added that the project would provide a “substantial boost to local livelihoods” and support long-term coastal economic growth.
Ziarat Hasan Shah Island lies near Karachi’s Eastern Zone and stretches roughly four kilometres in length, with a width ranging from 100 to 500 metres. Its southeastern sandy beach offers strong potential for hospitality, recreation and leisure activities, the minister said.
“The natural beauty and coastal environment of Ziarat Hasan Shah Island present a unique opportunity to create a high-value recreational hub that aligns with Pakistan’s growing coastal tourism demand,” Chaudhry added.
After PIA, Arif Habib sets sights on ‘blue economy’
As per the ministry, unlike other offshore developments, the island is accessible by land, allowing a direct road connection to Karachi’s existing road network. This accessibility would help reduce infrastructure costs and speed up development, while also encouraging local employment and business activity, the minister noted.
According to the ministry, the project will be implemented under a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) or Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, with the government seeking private investors with experience in hospitality, tourism and leisure development.
“We aim to attract credible partners while ensuring public interests are protected, and returns remain sustainable,” said Chaudhry.
Pakistan has more than 1,000 kilometres of coastline, much of it underutilised, and the government is seeking to position the maritime sector as a key driver of economic growth.
The island project is part of broader port-led and coastal initiatives intended to expand trade, tourism and investment as Pakistan seeks to strengthen its blue economy.","Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:42:49 GMT",,"Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry announced plans to transform Ziarat Hasan Shah Island.

Security Council on Thursday.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the protests against clerical rule.
But on Thursday,Trumpadopted a wait-and-see posture, saying he had been told that the killings were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions.

“President Trump is a man of action, not endless talk like we see at the United Nations. He has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter,” Waltz told the Security Council meeting, which Washington had requested.
Iran says will respond to any aggression
Waltz dismissed allegations by Iran that the protests are “a foreign plot to give a precursor to military action.”“Everyone in the world needs to know that the regime is weaker than ever before, and therefore is putting forward this lie because of the power of the Iranian people in the streets. They are afraid. They’re afraid of their own people,” Waltz said.
Iran’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Gholamhossein Darzi said Iran does not seek escalation or confrontation and accused Waltz of resorting “to lies, distortion of facts, and a deliberate misinformation campaign to conceal his country’s direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”
“However, any act of aggression - direct or indirect – will be met with a decisive, proportionate, and lawful response,” he told the Security Council. “This is not a threat; it is a statement of legal reality.”
Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the United States of convening the Security Council in a bid to “justify blatant aggression and interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state“ and threats to “solve the Iranian problem in its favorite way: through strikes aimed at overthrowing an undesirable regime.”
“We strongly urge the hot heads in Washington and other capitals … to come to their senses,” he said.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urges “maximum restraint at this sensitive moment and calls on all actors to refrain from any actions that could lead to further loss of life or ignite a wider regional escalation,” senior U.N. official Martha Pobee told the council.
“Loud and clear, again and again, we hear the Iranians lift their voices for a better life,” Denmark’s U.N. Ambassador Christina Markus Lassen told the Security Council. “For too long the leaders in Tehran have not heeded this call. The time has now come for the government of Iran to finally listen, to respond to the will of its people through peaceful means. We urge them to start today.”","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 23:35:15 GMT",,"U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz tells the Security Council that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter in Iran.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402553/india-to-ease-rules-to-boost-foreign-investment-in-domestic-defence-firms-sources-say,"India to ease rules to boost foreign investment in domestic defence firms, sources say - Business Recorder","NEW DELHI: India plans to make it much easier for foreign firms to invest in defence companies, two government sources with knowledge of the matter said - a move that would align with efforts to boost domestic manufacturing after last year’s conflict with Pakistan.
The cap on foreign direct investment in defence firms with existing licences under the so-called automatic route, where government approval is not required, is set to be raised to 74% from 49%, the sources said.
Presently, foreign investors can only own 74% of an Indian defence business under the automatic route when the companies are seeking new licenses.
The government is also in discussions about dropping a condition that stipulates foreign investment beyond 74% is only allowed if it “results in access to modern technology” - wording that has been criticised by experts as vague and ambiguous.
Move would allow foreign firms to take majority stakes
The planned easing of these rules, which has not been previously reported, is aimed at encouraging companies from defence partner nations to take majority stakes in Indian ventures, said the sources who were not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.
The reforms could be enacted in the next couple of months, they added.
India’s trade and defence ministries did not respond toReuters’ requests for comment.

Another condition set to be dropped is a requirement for fully export-oriented defence manufacturers to set up domestic maintenance and support facilities, the sources said.
“This condition compelled companies to first set up a base for maintenance activities, which can now be outsourced by the export-oriented units, making it easier for them to attract foreign investment,” said Amit Cowshish, a former defence ministry official.
Muted investment thus far
Foreign defence firms that currently have operations in India through joint ventures or strategic partnerships include France’s Airbus, Lockheed Martin of the US and Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defence Systems. India also has extensive defence ties with Russia.
That said, foreign equity inflows into India’s defence sector have been muted, accounting for $26.5 million of total foreign inflows of $765 billion in the 25 years through September 2025, according to government data.
India has sought to bolster funding for the defence sector following a short but deadly conflict with arch-rival Pakistan last May, in which drones and fighter jets took centre stage.
The defence ministry is asking for a 20% increase in spending in the budget for fiscal 2026/27 over the $75.36 billion allotted for the current year. Last year, the government also said it aimed to nearly double domestic production of defence equipment to $33.25 billion and boost defence exports to $5.5 billion by 2029.

During the session held in Bajaur on Sunday, the chief minister announced a significant increase in relief funds for houses partially damaged during recent operations, raising the compensation from 160,000 to 500,000 rupees.
The Jirga expressed complete confidence in the KP chief minister’s leadership while discussing the regional law and order situation, Pak-Afghan relations, and a long-term development strategy for the area. Participants also offered specific recommendations for achieving permanent stability in the merged districts.

Addressing the gathering, CM Afridi emphasised that sustainable peace can only be achieved through transparent decision-making that includes tribal elders and the provincial government. He criticised “closed-door decisions” for historically worsening security conditions and vowed that his administration would not be part of any “failed policies.”
He highlighted a severe financial shortfall from the federal government, noting that while 100 billion rupees annually was promised during the FATA merger, only 168 billion rupees has been released over the past seven years. He asserted that the federation still owes the province 532 billion rupees and is currently withholding funds under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP).
In a bid to support the youth and local infrastructure, the chief minister issued several key directives, including the upper age limit for police recruitment in merged districts will be increased to provide more opportunities for local residents.
Authorities have been ordered to expedite the processing of the Bajaur martyrs’ package. He directed to provide security for tribal elders, who play a vital role in national development and peace-building.
The provincial government will prioritise the improvement of schools and hospitals under the “Roshan Qabail Package,” he added.
Afridi concluded the meeting by paying tribute to the sacrifices made by the public, police, and security forces, noting that while peace had been largely restored by 2018, deliberate attempts are now being made to destabilise the province.
