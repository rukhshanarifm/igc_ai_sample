A three-member bench, headed by the Chief Justice Amin, on Wednesday heard the FBR appeals against the judgements of Sindh, Lahore and Islamabad High Courts regarding levy of Super Tax under Section 4C, inserted in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 through Finance Act 2015.
Farough Naseem, representing Karachi based taxpayers, said both the sides, particularly the FCC, would have to maintain the balance, in passing the judgement on the FBR appeals regarding levy of Super Tax under Sections 4B and 4C.

“Please don’t unsettle the settled provisions. This is not in anyone’s interest to unsettle the settled law.”
He warned the bench that; “If you disturb the settled provisions then there will be judicial chaos,” adding the provisions of law are always prospective.
He further argued that the Federal Constitutional Court can’t ignore 75 years’ jurisprudence of Pakistan, adding if it (FCC) would do that then there would be judicial havoc. He further said that the Courts never bulldoze the past judgements, and hoped that the FCC would not bulldoze the 75 years’ jurisprudence.
Farough stated that if the Court would allow the Parliament to legislate law with retrospective effect, then there will be horrible consequences for the economic activity in the country.
He argued that the FCC is hearing the appeals against the judgements of the High Courts, which were passed in accordance with the law that was prevalent before the 27th Constitutional Amendment. He stated therefore the Court now has to see whether those judgements were correct according to the law of that time.
He contended that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) would have to establish that the judgements, passed by the High Courts (SHC, LHC & IHC) according to the laws of that time, were wrong. He stated that the FCC three-member is handicapped to examine the judgements delivered by the larger bench of the Supreme Court. If the FCC wants to do that then it would not be appropriate, he cautioned the bench.
Farough stated that the FBR’s claim that the Super Tax was imposed on individuals and the companies earning more than Rs 500 million was due to shortage of money, adding the FBR’s this policy would create chaos, as not only the foreign investors would move their businesses out of the country, but those companies who pay huge taxes would also run away. He suggested that the FBR has other means to generate funds.
He said General Ziaul Haq had imposed Martial Law which somehow was successful, but the Martial Law of Pervez Musharraf failed because he did not consider other factors.
Farough argued that though it cannot be said that the Supreme Court of Pakistan judgements are binding on the FCC. However, the FCC needs to keep in mind that those judgements were delivered by the highest court of the country before the 27th Amendment. His emphasis was that the High Courts had rightly set aside the Sections 4B and 4C in accordance with the law prevalent at that time.
The case was adjourned until Thursday (today).

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402675/provincial-revenue-potential-largely-untapped-shehzad,Provincial revenue potential largely untapped: Shehzad - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’ provincial revenue potential remains largely untapped, and claims that provinces have outperformed the federal government on tax collection do not stand up to a factual review, said Khurram Shehzad, Advisor to the Finance Minister.
“The debate on fiscal federalism must be anchored in measured outcomes, not perceptions,” Shehzad said, pointing to wide disparities between federal and provincial tax effort despite provinces holding major constitutionally assigned tax bases.
He shared details with media noting that in fiscal year 2025 the federal government collected over Rs 13 trillion, equivalent to 11.3 percent of GDP, placing Pakistan on a trajectory to reach the 15 percent federal tax-to-GDP benchmark by June 2028. For countries at Pakistan’s level of development, total tax revenue of around 18 percent of GDP is considered normal, with the balance expected from provincial and state governments.
By contrast, all provinces combined collected just Rs 979 billion in fiscal year 2025, or 0.85 percent of GDP. “Provinces are expected to contribute around 3 percent of GDP. To get there by 2028, collections will need to more than triple,” Shehzad said.
According to him, the core problem is not the absence of a tax base, but weak revenue yield from existing bases.
On sales tax, Shehzad highlighted that services — a provincial subject — have an estimated taxable base of Rs 29 trillion, yet provinces collected only Rs 650 billion, a yield of 2.2 percent. In contrast, sales tax on goods — a federal subject — generated Rs 3.9 trillion from a Rs 30 trillion base, a yield of around 13 percent.
“This gap alone shows the difference in collection efficiency,” he said.
The picture is even starker in agricultural income tax, also a provincial responsibility. Despite an estimated taxable base of Rs 3.7 trillion, provinces collected just Rs 8.4 billion, a yield of 0.2 percent.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403007,The investment drain - Business Recorder,"Pakistan is the 5th most populous country having 64 percent of its population under the age of 30. It is often being pitched as a land of opportunities. However, despite an expanding market, a youthful workforce and strategic location, the country has not been able to attract enough investment, whether domestic and foreign.
A lot of literature has highlighted various economic issues as the main culprits like interest rate, exchange rate, inflation, low economic growth, etc. but, there are some other issues, which are affecting investment adversely in the country. When other countries are moving upward, Pakistan’s investment is sliding downward.
Back in 1975, the investment to GDP ratio of Pakistan was approximately 17 percent. After 50 years, it has decreased to 13.1 percent, which is a serious concern and needs proper pondering of policy makers.
Beside weak domestic investment, the country’s performance of attracting FDI is also lackluster. Back in 1990s, Pakistan used to attract more FDIs than India, but the equation has flipped completely. For example, in 1992, Pakistan attracted USD 336.5 million in FDI, while India attracted only USD 276.5 million. Now the trajectory has completely changed; in 2024, Pakistan only managed USD 2.7 billion, while India attracted USD 27.1 billion, which is almost 13 times higher.
In 2022, India attracted USD 50 billion FDI, while Pakistan has just USD 1.46 billion. Why has this huge divergence occurred? Various initiatives were taken like the Board of Investment, One Window Operation, and most recently the establishment of SIFC, but to no avail. Simply, policies are not feasible to attract the investors.
For instance, take the corporate tax rate, which is extremely high and can reach 65 percent. An investor wants profit, not punishment for investing. The standard corporate base rate is 29 percent and reaches up to 44 percent for some sectors. Then there are 10 percent super tax, 2 percent worker welfare fund, and 5 percent worker participation fund, summing up to 50 percent.
Also add 15 percent income tax of the dividends; the tax rate reaches 65 percent. Why on the earth will someone invest with such a higher tax rate? Why an investor will not invest in Dubai where the corporate tax rate is only 9 percent when income is above a threshold otherwise 0 percent tax? However, this seems a small problem as compared to the other issues, which are discouraging investors.
The security situation is one of them. It has not improved for decades. The country ranked second on the Global Terrorism Index and the attacks are not receding. How is one supposed to invest in such situation? Even domestic investors have shifted their capital to safe havens.
Similarly, the law and order situation in the country is also forcing investors to move to safer avenues.
Political instability is another major hurdle. Political parties are after one another driven by vendetta and not by national interest. There is no long-term political vision for the betterment of the country.
Citizens witness strikes, lockdowns and closure of main roads for weeks, affecting businesses adversely. In developed democracies, there are consistencies of policy regardless whichever party is in the government. Regrettably, the case is different in Pakistan.
Likewise, regulatory burdens and red tape are another nightmare. Instead of facilitation, regulations are often used as a tool of control. Compliance is very time consuming. If someone wants to install an electricity or gas connection, he has to wait for months. If one wants faster service, then one has to grease the palm of the authorities.
Similarly, opening a bank account is a herculean task, providing endless documents like utility bills, proof of income and so on. Company registration takes even more long and hectic documentation. Why would someone put his hard earned money in a process full of hurdles? On top of that, repatriating money or profit is also a struggle.
The weak judicial system is often ignored while discussing the investment issue. A strong judicial system provides confidence to investors that his interest cannot be harmed by anyone. Pakistan judicial system is ranked 129 out of 142 on the World Justice Project. There is no quick mechanism for dispute resolution.
The courts are overburdened and inefficient having more than 2.3 million backlog of cases. A commercial dispute takes years and sometime even decades. If someone wants to trouble you, he will just file a fabricated case and it will take years to prove that there is nothing substantial behind it.
For many domestic investors, the fear of political victimization combined with the lack of judicial protection discourages them to invest.
Then there are issues of infrastructure and policy inconsistency. Investors face electricity and power outages along with very high cost. To cope, many businesses have installed solar for power generation and every year there is a debate to tax their own generation.
The lack of policy inconsistency makes the situation further exacerbated. Many investors fear that today’s rules will not survive the next budget. In such unpredictability, no one is ready to invest in the country.
To cut the long story short, if Pakistan wants high investment, it has to make some amends. Otherwise, increasing investment will be a far cry in the wilderness.
Pakistan must address its governance problem, improve its law and order situation, strengthen its judicial system, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, improve policy consistency and cool down the political temperature. Then it will boost the morale of investors to invest in the country. Instead of higher taxes, the country needs to incentivize investors so that productivity can rise. Without transparent tax system, regulatory regime, protection of rights, contract enforcement, sustainable macro policy and reliable infrastructure, Pakistan will be bypassed by the serious investors.
The country cannot afford the outflow of investors like the recent exit of Procter & Gamble (P&G), Shell, Telenor, Pfizer, Bayer, Total Energies, Uber, Careem, and Microsoft.

The Committee further estimated that economy has posted a growth of 3.71 percent during first quarter (Q1) of fiscal year 2025-26.The Fund stated that global growth is projected to remain resilient at 3.3 percent in 2026 and at 3.2 percent in 2027: rates similar to the estimated 3.3 percent outturn in 2025. The forecast marks a small upward revision for 2026 and no change for 2027 compared with that in the October 2025 WEO. This steady performance on the surface results from the balancing of divergent forces. Headwinds from shifting trade policies are offset by tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), more so in North America and Asia than in other regions, as well as fiscal and monetary support, broadly accommodative financial conditions, and adaptability of the private sector.Global headline inflation is expected to decline from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2025 to 3.8 percent in 2026 and further to 3.4 percent in 2027. The inflation projections are also broadly unchanged from those in October and envisage inflation returning to target more gradually in the United States than in other large economies.Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. Re-evaluation of productivity growth expectations about AI could lead to a decline in investment and trigger an abrupt financial market correction, spreading from AI-linked companies to other segments and eroding household wealth. Trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity. Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices. Larger fiscal deficits and high public debt could put pressure on long-term interest rates and, in turn, on broader financial conditions. On the upside, activity could be further lifted by AI-related investment and eventually transform into sustainable growth if faster AI adoption translates into strong productivity gains and increased business dynamism. Activity could also be supported by a sustained easing in trade tensions. Policies to foster stability and sustainably lift medium-term growth prospects require a keen focus on restoring fiscal buffers, preserving price and financial stability, reducing uncertainty, and implementing structural reforms without further delay.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:56:32 GMT",,"IMF has cut its GDP projection for the current fiscal year to 3.2 percent.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402841/chinas-15th-five-year-plan-and-its-global-significance,China’s 15th five-year plan and its global significance - Business Recorder,"China’s Five-Year Plans have long served as the backbone of its economic and social transformation. Since the launch of the first plan in 1953, these policy blueprints have guided the country from socialist industrialization to export-led growth and mass urbanization.
Uniquely, China remains the only major economy to have successfully completed every Five-Year Plan with broadly achieved objectives. As Beijing prepares for the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026–2030), the shift underway carries profound implications not only for China’s future development but also for the global political economy.
For much of the reform era, particularly during the 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans, China pursued high-speed growth driven by heavy investment, industrial expansion, and exports. This model delivered extraordinary results, including sustained double-digit GDP growth and China’s rise as the world’s manufacturing hub.
The 13th Plan began acknowledging a “new normal” of slower growth, yet quantitative expansion remained central. By the late 2010s, however, structural constraints—overcapacity, environmental degradation, declining investment returns, demographic pressures, and intensifying geopolitical competition—made a strategic recalibration unavoidable.
The turning point came with the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025), which marked a decisive move away from growth at all costs. Notably, it avoided setting a rigid GDP growth target and instead elevated the concept of “high-quality development.”
Innovation, technological self-reliance, environmental sustainability, and social equity replaced sheer expansion as policy priorities. The emphasis on supply-chain security and the “dual circulation” strategy reflected China’s response to global uncertainty and external pressures.
The forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan builds on this transformation. Covering the period from 2026 to 2030, it represents a critical phase in China’s long-term goal of basically achieving socialist modernization by 2035. The plan is expected to consolidate China’s shift toward an innovation-led, resilient, and people-centered economy, focusing on quality rather than speed of growth.
Technological self-reliance will be a central pillar. China aims to strengthen indigenous innovation in strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum technology, bio manufacturing, hydrogen energy, and space industries. This drive is designed to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and foreign restrictions, but it also has global implications, particularly as technological competition with Western economies intensifies.
Equally significant is the plan’s strong commitment to green development. China has already emerged as the world’s largest investor in renewable energy, accounting for a substantial share of global solar and wind capacity additions. The 15th Plan is expected to further integrate ecological protection, clean energy, and low-carbon industrial systems into economic planning, aligning growth with climate responsibility.
Social modernization is another defining feature. Building on the vision of “common prosperity,” the plan emphasizes rural revitalisation, urban renewal, demographic resilience, and improved social welfare. By strengthening domestic consumption and reducing regional disparities, China seeks to create a more balanced and inclusive development model.
Beyond its domestic agenda, the 15th Five-Year Plan carries wide international significance. It reinforces China’s intention to remain engaged with the global economy while reshaping globalisation through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development, Security, Civilisation, and Governance Initiatives.
For developing regions in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa, the plan signals a shift toward higher quality, sustainable, and innovation-oriented cooperation.
For countries like Pakistan, this presents both opportunities and challenges. Chinese investment can support infrastructure development, industrial upgrading, and energy transition. At the same time, it underscores the need for careful policy choices to ensure economic sustainability, strategic balance, and long-term national interests.
Ultimately, China’s 15th Five-Year Plan symbolizes a historic transition—from rapid catch-up growth to qualitative, innovation-driven, and environmentally conscious modernization. Its success will shape not only China’s internal resilience and technological leadership but also the future contours of global trade, innovation, and development. As such, the plan deserves close attention well beyond China’s borders.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402603/editorial-export-emergency-awareness-is-first-step-towards-resolution,EDITORIAL: Export emergency: awareness is first step towards resolution - Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal announced the imposition of an “Export Emergency” in the country entailing the creation of a special cell in the Prime Minister’s Office to address problems and constraints facing the business community on an urgent basis with the objective of increasing exports by 40 percent in four years and 200 percent by 2035.
His statement reflects an awareness of a decline in exports leading to a rise in the trade deficit during the first half of the current year against the same period the year before — negative USD 19,204 million as opposed to negative USD 14,271 million — which implies that the reliance on foreign borrowing, including rollovers from friendly countries, borrowing from bilaterals and multilaterals, to shore up foreign exchange reserves continues unabated.
Awareness of a problem is the first step towards its resolution and requires sector experts/stakeholders to delve into the causes of the problem and formulate a set of remedial measures designed to resolve it in the short, medium and ideally long term.
There is a plethora of empirical research gathering dust in government offices that highlights the reasons behind Pakistan’s cyclical economic volatility.
The October 2024 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report titled Request for an Extended Fund Arrangement reiterated the crux of the problem notably “economic volatility has only increased over time, with a tight correlation between Pakistan’s boom-bust economic outcomes and its macroeconomic policies.” The report, disturbingly, added that “compared to nine other regional peers, the country’s export growth since 2000 has been second to last, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.

The country’s trade restrictions (including exchange measures, tariff and non-tariff barriers, restrictions to payments, etc.) have placed it consistently at or around the 90th percentile of the highest Measurement of Aggregate Trade Restrictions index…. This high level of protection has not helped improve, and likely undermined, Pakistan’s competitiveness.” One can only hope that the export emergency cell would take cognizance of these observations and not repeat past mistakes which have been to extend monetary and fiscal subsidies to specific influential sectors with the objective of increasing exports, which would reactivate the boom-bust syndrome.
While setting up an export emergency cell in the PM Office indicates that that the government has elevated it at the highest executive level, thereby facilitating appropriate policy decisions promptly, there is a need to carefully review the pledges made by the economic team leaders to the Fund — pledges that if not met may not only lead to a cessation of the next tranche release but as has been evident since 2019 may lead to the three friendly countries refusing to roll over 12 billion dollars to another year.
The Fund’s advice is implicit in its observation: “with an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles, the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products. Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors.” In other words, structural reforms are required that do not consist of monetary or fiscal incentives or setting up special economic zones, that the government has pledged to phase out and not announce any new ones but to end all existing economic distortions.
If past precedence is anything to go by an ‘export emergency cell’ will undertake measures that would bring it in conflict with pledges made to the IMF. To increase our leverage with the Fund would require taking measures that would be supported by the Fund and include ending the energy cross-subsidy paid for by industry, reducing current expenditure to create fiscal space that would ease the vise-like application of the Federal Board of Revenue’s audit function being described as harassment by industry, end red tape implicit in any new venture and end the elite capture of both budgeted resources as well as outlay.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403060/imf-lifts-2026-global-growth-forecast-but-flags-ai-trade-risks,"IMF lifts 2026 global growth forecast but flags AI, trade risks - Business Recorder","WASHINGTON: The IMF upgraded its 2026 global growth forecast Monday, citing a boost from tech investments but warning that a reevaluation of AI productivity gains or renewed trade tensions could bring disruptions.
World economic growth is projected to hold steady at 3.3 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said, raising its forecast by 0.2 percentage points from October. This would be the same pace of growth as in 2025.
But the Washington-based lender cautioned in its World Economic Outlook update that “the resilience exhibited so far is driven largely by a few sectors,” signaling vulnerability.
While the global economy appears to be “shaking off the trade and tariff disruptions of 2025,” this does not mean they had no impact, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.
Instead, the challenges were offset by “tailwinds from the AI and tech investment boom,” he told reporters.
This was especially true in North America and Asia, the IMF said.
The private sector also showed adaptability in dealing with trade shocks, while fiscal and monetary support provided boosts.
After he returned to the White House last January, US President Donald Trump unleashed sweeping tariffs that hit allies and competitors alike, roiling financial markets and supply chains while causing trade tensions to rocket.
But temperatures cooled over the year as the Trump administration struck tariff deals with several partners and crucially reached a temporary truce with the world’s second-biggest economy, China. For now, global inflation is expected to drop from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2025 to 3.8 percent in 2026.
Trump’s latest tariff threats against eight European countries in a standoff over the Danish territory of Greenland have thrown a spanner in the works.
“We see that we’re in this world in which trade tensions can erupt, geopolitical tensions can erupt. And that’s a downside risk for the global economy,” Gourinchas toldAFPduring an interview in Brussels.
Nonetheless, the IMF said trade policy uncertainty remains much higher than in January 2025 and there could still be occasional flare-ups.
The US Supreme Court is also due to rule on the legality of Trump’s use of emergency economic powers to impose tariffs on goods from virtually all trading partners.
The high court is widely expected to deliver a decision in early 2026, the fund said.
The strikedown of some duties would “inject another dose of trade policy uncertainty into the global economy,” Gourinchas added.
One concern is how Trump could tap other legal authorities to reimpose tariffs. Another issue is how the court ruling would impact government revenues, and therefore fiscal policies, he added.
Besides trade, the AI boom pushing the global economy forward comes with its own risks, Gourinchas said.
He flagged the risk of a “market correction” if expectations about AI gains, productivity and profitability are not realized.
A major catalyst of recent Wall Street stock records has been bullish sentiment about artificial intelligence.
However, if growth due to AI turns out to be unrealistic, a big drop in the stock market — a correction — could damage the economy if consumers pull back.
The pickup in tech investment and expenditure was estimated to add around 0.3 percentage points to average annualized US GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2025.
This offset a drag from the lengthy government shutdown late in the year.
Gourinchas noted the divergence between the United States — which is seeing a jump in AI tech investment — and other advanced economies.
The IMF estimates US growth at 2.4 percent this year, 0.3 percentage points higher than predicted in October.
In contrast, it expects euro area growth of 1.3 percent, and a slower pace in Japan.
Growth in China and India is also “relatively strong” compared with other emerging markets, Gourinchas said.
Most of the upward revision in global growth this time was accounted for by the United States and China, the IMF said.
Looking ahead, Gourinchas stressed the need for central bank independence, so that they can pursue their mandate of price stability and financial stability.
He did not comment on an ongoing US Justice Department probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
But he noted that the importance of the US dollar for the international monetary system means it is “even more important” the Fed is able to do its job and do it well.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:04:34 GMT",,"World economic growth is projected to hold steady at 3.3 percent this year, the IMF says.
