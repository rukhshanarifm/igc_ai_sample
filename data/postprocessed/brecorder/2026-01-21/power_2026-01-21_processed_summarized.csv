https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402591,Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report - Business Recorder,"Weak performance by Pakistan’s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country’s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.
The report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with “rigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)” to reduce tariffs were a milestone.
However, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.
“Overall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,” the report read.

The regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the “old era of scarcity is ending”, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might “prove to be even more complex”.
Operational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.
In its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.
Meanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the ‘Take or Pay’ electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.
NEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.
“A significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan’s power system.”
The regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.
“It remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.”
On the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.

At the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.
“Governance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan’s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,” the NEPRA report said.
KE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.
In contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.
QESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.

In the first full fiscal year of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government, SOEs slid deeper into financial distress, with their cumulative net losses surging by nearly 300 percent, soaring from Rs30.6 billion in FY2023-24 to a massive Rs122.9 billion in FY2024-25. These numbers, presented by the finance ministry at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises last week, expose a widening gap between promise and performance.A closer reading of the data deepens this disquiet. The combined revenues of SOEs fell over 10 percent to Rs12.4 trillion in FY2024-25, while even among profitable enterprises, earnings lost momentum, with aggregate profits sliding 13 percent from the previous year to end at Rs710 billion.
READ MORE:ADB approves $540mn financing to advance SOE reforms, coastal resilience in Pakistan
Loss-making SOEs offered little comfort, with their combined losses easing by a negligible two percent, a change too small to signal any meaningful turnaround. Worse still, SOEs also drew a massive Rs2.1 trillion in annual fiscal support, underscoring how public resources continue to be funneled into chronic inefficiency rather than productive growth. These fiscal flows were driven largely by higher equity injections to address the circular debt build-up, making it patently clear that public funds are being used to manage distress, and not to resolve the structural failures that continue to drag SOEs and the wider economy down.
While the finance ministry attributes the decline in SOE revenues primarily to falling international oil prices, which compressed margins in the oil sector, this factor can only explain a small part of the slowdown, and cannot account for the sheer magnitude of the losses now weighing on the public balance sheet. These losses, it must be noted, are not broadly spread but heavily concentrated in a small cluster of entities, most notably the National Highway Authority and several power distribution companies (DISCOs). This is hardly a new development. These entities have long been mired in inefficiency and chronic red ink, underscoring that the losses in FY2024-25 reflect deep-seated structural failures rather than temporary market fluctuations. Nowhere is this more evident than in DISCOs, which have come to embody the power sector’s systemic decay: a crumbling transmission and distribution (T&D) network haemorrhaging revenue through electricity theft, excessive line losses and chronic mis-governance. High depreciation and financing costs compound the problem, as an ageing T&D infrastructure inflates balance sheets without generating commensurate revenue, while repeated borrowing to bridge cash shortfalls and service circular debt accumulates interest expenses, locking these entities into a self-perpetuating cycle of financial stress.
Even when it comes to profit-making SOEs, the system’s limits are apparent, as their returns often rely on guaranteed government contracts, leaving open the question of whether they could survive under genuine open market competition. The need for a bold, wide-ranging reform agenda for SOEs, then, remains urgent, yet progress on the ground has been painfully slow.
Efforts so far have been piecemeal, lacking coherence, and often driven more by pressure from international lenders than by a genuine commitment to restructuring loss-making entities. Meaningful change would require comprehensive sectoral reorganisation, greater deregulation to foster competition and the establishment of robust corporate governance frameworks to tackle inefficiencies, while strengthening transparency and accountability.
What we’ve had on our hands instead is political inertia and bureaucratic resistance. This has meant that for an administration that has repeatedly promised sweeping SOE reform, plans remain largely on paper, execution is patchy at best and the cost of delay keeps mounting.
The government must recognise that without decisive action on SOE governance, accountability and privatisation, the reform narrative will remain meaningless while the financial haemorrhage continues unabated.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402666/power-sector-nepra-sees-limited-progress-despite-fixes,Power sector: Nepra sees ‘limited’ progress despite fixes - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: An assessment of Pakistan’s power sector during FY 2024-25 prompted National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to observe that despite several structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remains limited and insufficient to inspire confidence in the sector’s ability to support sustained industrial growth or provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential segments.
In its State of the Industry Report 2024-25, NEPRA stated that the power sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain efficiency and undermine its contribution to economic development.
The regulator emphasized that power sector entities must operate under commercially binding agreements that clearly define roles, performance standards, and accountability mechanisms.

Each entity should bear the financial consequences of its inefficiencies rather than passing these costs on to consumers, who are currently burdened with approximately Rs233 billion in Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)—a cost arising not from normal business operations but from inefficiencies within certain sector entities.
According to the report, generation capacity under “Take or Pay” contracts remains significantly underutilized, resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants. Simultaneously, the transmission network is both constrained and underutilized, contributing to higher transmission tariffs and preventing the dispatch of cheaper and more efficient electricity in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, several government-owned DISCOs continue to suffer from poor governance, with transmission and distribution (T&D) losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery, and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. These inefficiencies further exacerbate asset underutilisation across generation, transmission, and distribution, while fueling the circular debt problem.
Nepra noted that challenges faced by power sector entities—largely government-owned—span planning, execution, and operational domains.
Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered financial sustainability and limited the sector’s contribution to economic growth. Weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management further constrain the sector’s ability to provide reliable and affordable electricity.
During FY 2024-25, efforts were made to reduce “Take or Pay” generation capacity through the retirement or decommissioning of inefficient power plants with consistently low utilisation. As a result, 2,829 MW of capacity was retired, decommissioned, or had its Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) terminated.
Consequently, effective operational generation capacity declined to 41,121 MW as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888 MW a year earlier. However, 884 MW of new hydropower capacity—Suki Kinari Hydropower Project—was added during the year.
The utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the CPPA-G system remained 38.82%. NEPRA highlighted that generation costs account for nearly 82% of the electricity tariff. During FY 2024-25, the actual per-unit Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) stood at Rs14.21/kWh, the highest component of the electricity tariff, primarily due to underutilisation of “Take or Pay” plants.
During the year, several power plants approached NEPRA through CPPA-G seeking reductions in generation tariffs. Approval of these adjustments is expected to yield long-term benefits by lowering generation costs, improving tariff efficiency, and stabilizing consumer prices, while also supporting investor confidence through a predictable regulatory environment.
However, NEPRA noted that persistent inefficiencies in public sector power plants — such as the 747 MW Guddu Power Plant, 969 MW Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, and several WAPDA-operated hydro plants—are undermining tariff reduction efforts. These inefficiencies result in lower utilisation, higher costs, and reduced system efficiency, offsetting gains from IPP tariff reductions and plant retirements.
The Part Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) added Rs46.388 billion to generation costs in FY 2024-25, compared to Rs55.671 billion in 2023-24, and, while unavoidable, these costs can be significantly reduced through effective demand-side management.
Similarly, Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) costs declined to Rs13.285 billion, from Rs39.521 billion, though NEPRA said further reductions are possible through better grid management.
Lower utilisation of Thar coal-based power plants, which operated at 67.23% utilisation, also raised generation costs by inflating both CPP and Energy Purchase Price (EPP). Delays in ensuring regular coal supply to Lucky Electric Power Company further exacerbated inefficiencies.
Nepra observed widespread underutilisation of transmission assets, including the 4,000 MW Matiari–Lahore HVDC line, which operated at just 35% utilisation despite payments based on full availability. Manual system logs further hinder accurate assessment of transmission performance.
The poor performance of the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) has led to violations of the economic merit order, increased generation costs, project delays, and cost overruns. Delays in key projects—including KE-NGC interconnection, Lahore North Grid, and SCADA-III—have adversely affected system reliability and finances.
Governance remains the most critical issue confronting DISCOs. KE, PESCO, HESCO, SEPCO, and QESCO were identified as the poorest performers, with excessive losses, low recovery, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Except for TESCO, no DISCO met Nepra-approved T&D loss targets.
Weak DISCO performance contributed approximately Rs397 billion to circular debt during the year. Nepra termed load-shedding based on AT&C losses unlawful and inequitable, as it penalizes compliant consumers and deepens sector inefficiencies.
Rising electricity costs and poor service have pushed consumers—particularly affluent ones—towards rooftop solar PV systems and battery storage, reducing grid demand during non-solar hours.
Nepra also expressed concern over the underperformance of the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO), citing limited adoption of modern technologies and the absence of a fully functional SCADA system.
The regulator concluded that Pakistan’s power sector transformation remains incomplete without full implementation of the 1992 WAPDA Restructuring Plan, emphasizing corporatization, decentralization, privatization, and separation of policy, regulation, and operations. Continued centralized control, overlapping mandates, and weak accountability, it warned, will perpetuate inefficiencies and impose unnecessary financial burdens on the economy.

Nepra stated that despite determining consumer-end tariffs in a manner that fully covers the revenue requirements of all entities across the power supply chain, persistent structural inefficiencies and the historical poor performance of distribution companies (Discos) leave little reason to expect that circular debt can be sustainably controlled.
The regulator explained that if NEPRA-determined tariffs were fully implemented and all sector entities met prescribed performance targets, each entity’s financial obligations would be met and circular debt would not arise.
READ MORE:Govt wants to alter KE consumer-end tariff as per Nepra fixation
However, in practice, several power sector entities fail to achieve these targets due to weak governance, poor recovery performance, and high technical and commercial losses, resulting in insufficient revenue collection and the continued accumulation of circular debt.
As of June 30, 2025, circular debt in Pakistan’s power sector stood at approximately Rs1.614 trillion, compared to Rs2.393 trillion a year earlier, reflecting a reduction of around Rs780 billion. Nepra noted, however, that this decline does not represent a structural improvement and mirrors similar short-term reductions seen in the past.
According to Nepra, both current and previous declines in circular debt primarily resulted from external financial injections rather than from meaningful sector reforms. During FY 2024-25, DISCO inefficiencies contributed approximately Rs265 billion through excessive T&D losses and Rs132 billion due to low recovery ratios. Despite these shortcomings, the overall circular debt figure declined during the year.
Nepra attributed this reduction to the Government of Pakistan securing commercial financing to retire liabilities of Power Holding (Private) Limited (PHPL) and clear arrears owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). While this intervention temporarily lowered circular debt, it failed to address the sector’s underlying inefficiencies.
To service the cost of this borrowing, most electricity consumers — excluding a few protected domestic categories—are now required to pay an additional Rs3.23 per kWh under the Debt Servicing Surcharge for several years. Nepra noted that this surcharge effectively transfers the burden of sector inefficiencies to consumers and represents one of the largest components of the end-user tariff, after the Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) and Energy Purchase Price (EPP).
Nepra further stated that KE, the country’s only private-sector distribution company, does not contribute to circular debt, as it absorbs the financial impact of higher losses and lower recoveries instead of passing these costs on to consumers. Despite this, KE consumers remain subject to the DSS. To date, KE has collected and remitted Rs35.76 billion under the DSS to the Government of Pakistan and CPPA-G.
The regulator observed that had public-sector Discos been privatized in line with the 1992 power sector reform strategy, trillions of rupees in losses could have been avoided, and consumers would have benefited from improved service quality. Nepra added that although challenges to privatization persist even after more than two decades, these hurdles can be overcome through well-designed strategies and firm political commitment.
Given the prevailing structural inefficiencies and the historical performance of Discos, Nepra concluded that there is little justification to expect sustainable control of circular debt or lasting improvements in the power sector under the existing framework.

Nepra data shows that KE has recorded a sustained decline in transmission and distribution losses since its privatization in 2005, when losses were reported at around 40 percent. By FY 2024-25, KE’s losses had fallen to below 15 percent, a level that remains above ideal benchmarks but is significantly lower than those observed across several public-sector Discos. The regulator attributed this long-term reduction to improved governance mechanisms and greater operational accountability following privatization.
In its assessment of recovery performance, Nepra observed that KE absorbed the impact of recovery shortfalls internally rather than transferring the burden to the power supply chain. While KE consumers continued to pay the federally imposed Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS), under which Rs. 35.76 billion was collected during the year, the utility itself did not add to sector-wide payment arrears, distinguishing its financial treatment from that of government-owned Discos.
Referring to broader sector reforms, Nepra noted that KE’s post-privatization experience illustrates the potential benefits of reduced government control, including greater financial discipline and operational responsiveness. However, the regulator cautioned that KE’s performance should be viewed as part of a wider reform discussion rather than an isolated solution, emphasising that comprehensive structural changes across all distribution companies would be required to achieve sustainable sector-wide improvement.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403181,Power sector is only less bad - Business Recorder,"Awais Leghari is clearly not a fan of NEPRA’s State of Industry Reports (SOIR). He slammed the 2025 edition for being published with a 5–6 month delay, claiming the lag made it “misleading” and irrelevant to the sector’s current state.
The truth tells a different story. Nepra reports have almost always followed this timeline. Given the scale and complexity of the SOIR, a January release is entirely plausible. Delays are structural, not exceptional.
At another level, the ministry’s own entities bear responsibility. Persistent failures in timely submission of generation, distribution, transmission, and collection data may well have ledinto these lags.
To call the flagship report “dated and misleading” is sour in taste. Six months do not fundamentally change sector dynamics. No ground-breaking initiatives have occurred in that period that could invalidate Nepra’s findings.
If the ministry genuinely objects to “misleading conclusions,” the solution is simple: publish monthly or quarterly sectoral data publicly. Transparent, timely disclosure would allow researchers and policymakers to assess the sector accurately, rather than relying on reactive rebuttals.
READ MORE:Power sector: Nepra sees ‘limited’ progress despite fixes
The minister takes issue with Nepra’s characterization of the Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per unit as “additional.” Technically, he is correct. The surcharge, levied to collect a small matter of Rs1800 billion to service the loans stemming from the government\s own colossal perennialinefficiency, over the next six years, is not new.
But winning the technical point misses the larger reality. This surcharge is the biggest exercise yet of penalizing the paying public for government inefficiencies. It is a tacit admission that the system cannot run without transferring the cost of loans, subsidies, and operational shortfalls directly to households.
Contrary to Leghari’s framing, the DSS did not exist forever. It was introduced at the start of FY24, and the government has now formally extended it for six more years from FY25. This is not a minor clarification. It is a direct burden on the public, effectively stamping in place a mechanism to extract billions to keep a poorly managed system afloat.
The minister went a step further by rejecting Nepra’s claim that system losses above regulatory targets impose an unnecessary burden on consumers. According to the minister, these gaps, both high losses and low recoveries, are financed by the Ministry of Finance through general revenue and therefore do not burden electricity consumers.
This argument takes the cake.
Losses above allowed limits and recoveries below targets feed directly and mechanically into the circular debt pipeline. There is no abstraction here. Every rupee lost due to inefficiency adds to the debt stock that the system cannot pay for on its own.
To argue that additions to circular debt do not burden consumers is baffling. Consumers are already paying for it. The DSS exists precisely because the bulk of circular debt flows from distribution inefficiencies and collection failures. In FY25 alone, losses and recoveries still imposed a toll of no less than Rs400 billion, the second highest annual accumulation in history despite claimed improvements.
The impact does not stop there. Transmission and distribution losses are routinely factored into quarterly tariff adjustments, which the regulator hears and approves every three months. These adjustments translate directly into higher bills. The link between losses and consumer burden is neither theoretical nor indirect. It is embedded in the tariff structure itself.
Claiming that the government absorbs the entire cost through general revenue is both incorrect and insensitive. General revenue is taxpayer money. Diverting it to cover inefficiencies in the power sector crowds out spending on health, education, and development. It does not eliminate the burden. It merely shifts and disguises it.
To trivialize this reality by suggesting that inefficiencies funded through the budget are somehow benign reflects a deeper problem. It normalizes failure. It treats the misuse of public resources as acceptable. And it ignores the fact that consumers pay for inefficiency twice, once through electricity bills and again through taxes.
Responding to assessment that rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar adoption, and that weak economic activity further suppressed demand, the minister countered by claiming the average tariff had declined from Rs53.04 per unit in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit by December 2025.
Choosing one’s own goalposts because it suits the narrative is typical of governments. Yes, tariffs have come down from their peaks. But that is like saying the scoreline improved from a 10–0 loss two years ago to a 7–0 loss this time.
The fact remains that electricity tariffs are still very high. Marginal relief does not erase cumulative damage. Nor does it restore confidence in the grid.
The shift to solar will not reverse simply because tariffs have slipped a few points. Consumers made that shift when electricity became unaffordable and unpredictable. That calculation has not changed.
If anything, the economics now tilt further away from the grid. Solar panels continue to get cheaper. Payback periods are shortening. Every incremental reduction in equipment cost reinforces the exit decision.
Against this backdrop, citing a fall in average tariffs misses the point. Behavior has already changed. The grid is competing not with past tariffs, but with falling solar costs and permanently altered consumer expectations.
Data delays do not negate dysfunction. Surcharges do not stop being burdens because they are relabeled. Losses do not disappear because they are routed through the budget. And tariffs do not become affordable because they fall from extreme to merely high.
The power sector’s problem is not perception. It is credibility. Until inefficiency is addressed at source rather than socialized through consumers and taxpayers, the exodus from the grid will continue. And no amount of arithmetic will change that.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:43:50 GMT",,"Aais Leghari slammed the 2025 edition for being published with a 5–6 month delay.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403257/world-bank-concerned-about-nepras-independence,World Bank concerned about Nepra’s independence - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bank (WB) has reportedly raised concerns over proposed amendments to the Nepra Act, 1997, and the Electricity Act, 1910, which may compromise the independence of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), well-informed sources toldBusiness Recorder.
Under the proposed changes, the term “Federal Government” is being replaced with “Power Division” or “division concerned” for the approval of various regulatory proposals. On Sunday, in a rare development, sitting Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari publicly rebutted figures presented in Nepra’s State of Industry Report 2024–25.
“The World Bank has held one meeting with the concerned authorities and conveyed its concerns regarding the proposed replacement of the term ‘Federal Government’ with Division’. Another meeting is expected in the coming days,” the sources added.
The country’s business community and industrial sector have also expressed serious concerns over the Power Division’s move, warning that it could force the regulator to compromise its independence.
According to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also taken notice of the Power Division’s move regarding amendments to the Nepra Act.
“The prime minister has directed the Power minister to discuss the matter with him,” the sources quoted the PM Office as saying.
Section 3(a) of the Act empowers the Authority to determine tariffs, rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services by generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and to recommend these to the relevant division for notification.
Under the revised Section 31(7), notification of Nepra-approved tariffs or uniform tariffs — along with rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services—shall be made in the official Gazette by the division concerned within 30 days of intimation by the Authority.

If the division fails to notify the tariff or refer the matter back to Nepra for reconsideration within the specified timeframe, the Authority may direct immediate application of its approved tariff through notification, subject to any subsequent adjustments arising from reconsideration requested by the Division.
Section 31(7)(i) provides that the division concerned may, within 30 days of receiving Nepra’s intimation regarding approved tariffs of public-sector distribution and supply licensees, require the Authority to reconsider its determination on issues common to these licensees. The Nepra would then be required to complete the reconsideration within 30 days and inform the division accordingly.
Under Section 31(7)(ii), the Nepra may make quarterly tariff adjustments within 15 days on account of capacity and transmission charges, transmission and distribution losses, variable operation and maintenance costs, and policy guidelines issued by the division concerned.
The adjusted tariff would be intimated to the division prior to Gazette notification. The division may seek reconsideration within 15 days, failing which Nepra shall notify the adjusted tariff in the official Gazette. If reconsideration is sought, the Nepra must decide the matter within 15 days and intimate the division before notification.
Section 31(7)(iii) allows the division concerned, in lieu of seeking reconsideration, to file an appeal. However, once a reconsideration request is filed, the Power Division will not be entitled to subsequently appeal the decision on that reconsideration. No changes have been proposed to Section 31(7)(iv).
Similarly, amendments have been proposed to the Electricity Act, 1910, replacing the term “Federal Government” with “appropriate authority” or “division concerned.”
Under the revised Section 32(2), any dispute between an operator and the telegraph authority regarding the placement or operation of electric supply lines shall be referred to the division concerned, which may direct the operator to make necessary alterations to comply with the law. Amendments to Section 53(1)(a) relate to the service of notices, orders, or documents, stipulating that where the addressee is the Federal or Provincial Government, such service shall be made at the office designated by the division concerned.
Business Recordersent few questions to Power Division. Questions and their response are as follows
The primary purpose of the proposed amendments is to remove procedural difficulties and avoid unnecessary administrative delays. Following the Mustafa Impex judgment, the Federal Cabinet directed all ministries to review existing laws, rules, and regulations to ensure that routine and technical matters are not escalated to the Cabinet where such escalation is not required. Accordingly, the amendments mainly replace the term “Federal Government” with “concerned Division” in limited procedural contexts to streamline filings, notifications, and technical reviews, without altering the substantive regulatory framework.
No. This understanding is incorrect. The amendments do not make Nepra subordinate to the Power Division in any manner. The Nepra remains an independent statutory regulator, administratively reporting to the Federal Cabinet. No changes have been proposed that require amendments to the Rules of Business or that alter Nepra’s legal status, independence, or quasi-judicial authority. The amendments are strictly administrative and do not interfere with Nepra’s core regulatory mandate.
No. Wherever policy decisions or policy directions are involved, the term “Federal Government” has been consciously retained in the law. At no place do the proposed amendments authorise the Power Division to issue policy directions independently or bypass the Federal Cabinet. The scope of the changes is limited to procedural and technical matters only.
The Federal Cabinet has approved the draft set of proposed amendments. Following this, the draft legislation will undergo due legal vetting and finalisation. Once completed, the bill will be submitted to Parliament through the Parliamentary Affairs Division, in accordance with the prescribed legislative process.

Sources said the top leadership of the Power Division has long been at odds with the power sector regulator on multiple issues, with some officials openly criticising NEPRA members for “behaving like judges.”
The Power minister has also reportedly expressed displeasure over several of the Authority’s decisions. Under the proposed amendments to the Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997, references to the “Federal Government” are to be replaced with the “appropriate authority.”

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403181/power-sector-is-only-less-bad,Power sector is only less bad - Business Recorder,"Awais Leghari is clearly not a fan of NEPRA’s State of Industry Reports (SOIR). He slammed the 2025 edition for being published with a 5–6 month delay, claiming the lag made it “misleading” and irrelevant to the sector’s current state.
The truth tells a different story. Nepra reports have almost always followed this timeline. Given the scale and complexity of the SOIR, a January release is entirely plausible. Delays are structural, not exceptional.
At another level, the ministry’s own entities bear responsibility. Persistent failures in timely submission of generation, distribution, transmission, and collection data may well have ledinto these lags.
To call the flagship report “dated and misleading” is sour in taste. Six months do not fundamentally change sector dynamics. No ground-breaking initiatives have occurred in that period that could invalidate Nepra’s findings.
If the ministry genuinely objects to “misleading conclusions,” the solution is simple: publish monthly or quarterly sectoral data publicly. Transparent, timely disclosure would allow researchers and policymakers to assess the sector accurately, rather than relying on reactive rebuttals.
READ MORE:Power sector: Nepra sees ‘limited’ progress despite fixes
The minister takes issue with Nepra’s characterization of the Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per unit as “additional.” Technically, he is correct. The surcharge, levied to collect a small matter of Rs1800 billion to service the loans stemming from the government\s own colossal perennialinefficiency, over the next six years, is not new.
But winning the technical point misses the larger reality. This surcharge is the biggest exercise yet of penalizing the paying public for government inefficiencies. It is a tacit admission that the system cannot run without transferring the cost of loans, subsidies, and operational shortfalls directly to households.
Contrary to Leghari’s framing, the DSS did not exist forever. It was introduced at the start of FY24, and the government has now formally extended it for six more years from FY25. This is not a minor clarification. It is a direct burden on the public, effectively stamping in place a mechanism to extract billions to keep a poorly managed system afloat.
The minister went a step further by rejecting Nepra’s claim that system losses above regulatory targets impose an unnecessary burden on consumers. According to the minister, these gaps, both high losses and low recoveries, are financed by the Ministry of Finance through general revenue and therefore do not burden electricity consumers.
This argument takes the cake.
Losses above allowed limits and recoveries below targets feed directly and mechanically into the circular debt pipeline. There is no abstraction here. Every rupee lost due to inefficiency adds to the debt stock that the system cannot pay for on its own.
To argue that additions to circular debt do not burden consumers is baffling. Consumers are already paying for it. The DSS exists precisely because the bulk of circular debt flows from distribution inefficiencies and collection failures. In FY25 alone, losses and recoveries still imposed a toll of no less than Rs400 billion, the second highest annual accumulation in history despite claimed improvements.
The impact does not stop there. Transmission and distribution losses are routinely factored into quarterly tariff adjustments, which the regulator hears and approves every three months. These adjustments translate directly into higher bills. The link between losses and consumer burden is neither theoretical nor indirect. It is embedded in the tariff structure itself.
Claiming that the government absorbs the entire cost through general revenue is both incorrect and insensitive. General revenue is taxpayer money. Diverting it to cover inefficiencies in the power sector crowds out spending on health, education, and development. It does not eliminate the burden. It merely shifts and disguises it.
To trivialize this reality by suggesting that inefficiencies funded through the budget are somehow benign reflects a deeper problem. It normalizes failure. It treats the misuse of public resources as acceptable. And it ignores the fact that consumers pay for inefficiency twice, once through electricity bills and again through taxes.
Responding to assessment that rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar adoption, and that weak economic activity further suppressed demand, the minister countered by claiming the average tariff had declined from Rs53.04 per unit in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit by December 2025.
Choosing one’s own goalposts because it suits the narrative is typical of governments. Yes, tariffs have come down from their peaks. But that is like saying the scoreline improved from a 10–0 loss two years ago to a 7–0 loss this time.
The fact remains that electricity tariffs are still very high. Marginal relief does not erase cumulative damage. Nor does it restore confidence in the grid.
The shift to solar will not reverse simply because tariffs have slipped a few points. Consumers made that shift when electricity became unaffordable and unpredictable. That calculation has not changed.
If anything, the economics now tilt further away from the grid. Solar panels continue to get cheaper. Payback periods are shortening. Every incremental reduction in equipment cost reinforces the exit decision.
Against this backdrop, citing a fall in average tariffs misses the point. Behavior has already changed. The grid is competing not with past tariffs, but with falling solar costs and permanently altered consumer expectations.
Data delays do not negate dysfunction. Surcharges do not stop being burdens because they are relabeled. Losses do not disappear because they are routed through the budget. And tariffs do not become affordable because they fall from extreme to merely high.
The power sector’s problem is not perception. It is credibility. Until inefficiency is addressed at source rather than socialized through consumers and taxpayers, the exodus from the grid will continue. And no amount of arithmetic will change that.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:43:50 GMT",,"Aais Leghari slammed the 2025 edition for being published with a 5–6 month delay.

Reduction in Capital: A private limited company having a share capital may reduce its share capital by special resolution and supported by a solvency statement of all the directors, as referred in Section 89A.
The company may reduce its share capital in any way, namely-
(a) cancel any paid-up share capital which is lost or un-represented by available assets; or for which subscription money has not been received from subscribers;
(b) pay off any paid-up share capital which is in excess of the needs of the company.

(m) Any other service(s) which the Council with the prior approval of the Commission, may determine to be a “prohibited service”.
Register of members: Every company shall keep an electronic register of its members. An electronic register must contain such particulars of each member as may be specified.
Power of Court to Rectify the Register of Members: Section 126 of the Companies Act, 2017 empowered the Court to order rectification of the register of members or debenture-holders in cases of fraudulent or erroneous entry, omission, or unnecessary delay. While this provision provided judicial oversight, in practice it resulted in lengthy, costly, and time-consuming litigation, even for matters of a purely administrative or procedural nature. With the evolution of corporate regulation and increased reliance on electronic filings and real-time data maintenance, the continued requirement of approaching courts for rectification of registers become disproportionate and inconsistent with modern regulatory practices. The retention of section 126 also resulted in duplication of remedies, as similar relief mechanisms already exist under sections 87 and 464 of the Act. Moreover to cater this, section 74A is inserted and sec 464(7) is amended to further address it.
Statutory Meeting: The elimination of the requirement of holding a statutory meeting is proposed as the provision has no practical utility in the present regulatory framework.
The original objective of ensuring initial disclosure of a company’s affairs is already achieved through existing requirements. .
Annual General Meeting: Every company is required to hold an annual general meeting within sixteen months from the date of its incorporation and thereafter once in every calendar year within a period of one hundred and twenty days following the close of its financial year. This requirement is proposed to be eliminated for private companies, not being public interest companies and subsidiaries of listed companies, where the board of directors holds at least seventy five percent of voting rights.
Provisions as to meetings and votes.— A company may hold a general meeting-
a) at a physical venue; or
b) by using virtual meeting technology through service providers in the manner prescribed; or c) both at a physical venue and by using virtual meeting technology through service providers in the manner prescribed.
Provided that from a date to be notified by the Commission, every company shall be required to hold e-meetings and conduct e-voting through a prescribed e-platform, in the manner specified by the Commission, for such class or classes of companies as may be notified.’
Explanation: “Service provider” means any person registered by the Commission to provide an e-platform for meetings in terms of Section 134A.
Companies face considerable practical difficulties in allocating nominal shareholding to the independent and woman directors for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of this section. Independent and female directors also face considerable difficulties dealing with ownership of the companies in which they are acting as independent directors, including cumbersome asset disclosures and tax-related disclosures at the time of transfer of shares.
Independent Director: The independent director of a listed company shall be elected or appointed in the same manner as specified by the Commission.
Disqualification of Director: Where a person has been penalised under section 127 of the Act or has contravened the provisions of the sections 182, 184, 197, 208, 222, 243, 254, 261, 272, 324, 400, 401, 402, 405, 418, 424 and 497 or has been penalized under section 193 of the Act, the said person cannot be a director.
Loan to Directors: Restriction on loan to directors shall not apply in case of loan given to the chief executive or the whole-time director who is an employee of the company, subject to the condition that the loan is given as per the approved company policy for loans to employees.
Method of Contracting: These provisions do not relate to Company have been deleted.
Liability of Undesired Activities: Liability for “undesired activities” is subjective and restrictive for shareholders. Eliminating the section will reduce ambiguity and will give freedom to shareholders who are actual owners of the company.
Inspection of books of account by the Commission: It is proposed that for the purpose of ascertaining whether a company who is complying with or has complied with any provision or requirement of this Act or the terms and conditions of licence or registration, the Commission may from time to time inspect any record or document relating to any company. This provision already exists however it is proposed to clarify the matter.
Declaration of Dividend: At present, the following condition prevails:
(2) No dividend shall be declared or paid by a company for any financial year out of the profits of the company made from the sale or disposal of any immovable property or assets of a capital nature comprised in the undertaking or any of the undertaking of the company, unless the business of the company consists, whether wholly or partly, of selling and purchasing any such property or assets, except after such profits are set off or adjusted against losses arising from the sale of any such immovable property or assets of a capital nature: Provided that no dividend shall be declared or paid out of unrealized gain on investment property credited to profit and loss account.
The provision is proposed to be replaced by:
(2) A resolution of directors passed under subsection (1) shall contain a statement that, in the opinion of the directors, the company will immediately after the distribution, satisfy the solvency test.
The deletion of sub-section (2) removes restriction on dividend distribution from capital gains, which no longer reflects modern accounting standards and business realities. Instead, the proposed proviso introduces a solvency test to ensure that dividends, whether from current or accumulated profits, are declared only when the company can meet its financial obligations
Unclaimed Dividend: The unclaimed dividend shall vest with the Federal Government with oversight by the Commission.
Cost Audit. Provisions relating to “Audit of Cost Accounts” are proposed to be eliminated.
Right of Commission: A new provision has been inserted to the effect that the Commission may investigate a dispute exists among the members or directors regarding shareholding or directorship arising from a fraudulent entry, an entry made without sufficient cause, or an omission in the relevant statutory register.
Management by Administrator. The Commission or the registrar has been given powers to appoint administrators on its own motion also if a situation for appointment of administrator exists. Previously, this right was subject to the approval of members having not less than sixty percent of the paid up capital of a company or a secured creditor or secured creditors having interest equivalent
Process of voluntary winding up: The amendment proposes that the Court has no role in the process of voluntary winding-up proceedings, which are intended to be managed independently by the company and its creditors without judicial intervention. Accordingly, the power to approve any extension in the completion of winding-up proceedings has been aligned with the voluntary nature of the process and vested in the company, through a special resolution in the general meeting, and in the creditors’ meeting in case of a creditors’ voluntary winding up. This change ensures procedural consistency, reduces unnecessary court involvement, and promotes efficiency, self-regulation, and timely closure of companies.

In this regard, the Power Division has issued directions to NTDC, while the Minister has provided guidance regarding the transfer of the Standards and Specifications (S&S) function for 11kV and below from NGC to PPMC.
However, as a state-owned enterprise, NGC is required to obtain formal approval from its Board of Directors for any such functional transfer. A due diligence process is currently under way.
READ MORE:Rs23bn NGC-PMLTC dispute lands in CPEC panel’s camp
Based on the findings of a constituted committee and NGC’s institutional experience, the newly appointed Managing Director of NGC, Altaf Hussain Malik, has highlighted several critical risks associated with the proposed transfer.
Safety and system integrity:The S&S function ensures uniformity, quality, and safety across the power distribution network. NGC possesses decades of engineering expertise, accredited laboratories, and compliance with international standards such as IEC, IEEE, and ANSI. Transferring this role to a non-engineering entity like PPMC—which lacks the requisite technical capacity and testing infrastructure—could compromise equipment reliability, increase system failures, and pose significant public safety risks.
Regulatory and legal non-compliance:NGC operates under a Nepra licence, with the S&S mandate embedded in the Grid Code. PPMC is an unlicensed entity with no statutory role in engineering standards.
Any such transfer would violate existing regulations and require extensive legislative and regulatory amendments, creating legal uncertainty and potential audit objections.
Financial and operational impact:The S&S office is a profitable, revenue-generating unit for NGC, contributing approximately Rs 30–40 million per month. Its transfer without proper financial and operational valuation would result in substantial revenue losses to the national exchequer and disrupt service continuity to DISCOs — none of which have raised concerns about NGC’s current S&S services.
Misalignment with sector reforms and global practice:Globally, standards and specifications are managed by utilities and are ultimately vested within distribution companies once they develop in-house capacity.
Transferring this function to an intermediate, non-technical government entity does not align with international best practices and would add unnecessary bureaucratic layering without any technical or operational benefit.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403029,Circular debt brought down: NA told - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly was informed on Monday that the total circular debt, which stood at Rs2,794 billion in March 2024, was brought down to Rs1,614 billion in June 2025 – marking an improvement of Rs780 billion within just one year.
In response to questions raised by lawmakers, Minister for Power Awais Leghari outlined a series of measures designed to curb the accumulation of circular debt.
He explained that the measures included negotiations with power producers to waive Rs260 billion in late payment interest charges, along with efforts to reduce inefficiencies within Distribution Companies (Discos), which led to an improvement of Rs193 billion. As a result, the debt in Discos decreased from Rs590 billion in 2024 to Rs397 billion in 2025, he added.
He also highlighted improvements in macroeconomic indicators – such as a stable exchange rate, lower KIBOR, and reduced inflation – as factors that contributed to lower tariffs and reduced markup charges on payables. These, in turn, played a key role in reducing the circular debt, he added. The minister also confirmed that K-Electric had resumed regular payments as part of the debt reduction plan.
He stated that the government has set a target to eliminate circular debt within the next six years, supported by parallel reforms aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the power sector. “This initiative is expected to lead to the removal of the Debt Servicing Surcharge, which currently stands at Rs3.23 per unit and is levied to cover the markup on circular debt payables,” he added.
Additionally, he mentioned that the government plans to reconstitute the boards of Discos to further address inefficiencies within distribution companies.
Moreover, he stated that the government has begun transitioning to a more competitive electricity market, moving away from the long-standing single-buyer model, where the state was the sole purchaser of electricity.
The new structure will operate through competitive bidding and market-based pricing under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contractual Market (CTBCM) framework, he added.
During the question hour, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik assured the House that the domestic gas sector is receiving uninterrupted supply at optimal pressure, especially during peak cooking hours.
He added that Sui companies are ensuring daily gas availability from 5 am to 10 pm. Malik also informed the House that the addition of 12 LNG cargoes to the supply network had improved the availability of regasified LNG (RLNG), helping meet demand across all sectors. Additionally, a dedicated dashboard has been set up to address consumer complaints on a daily basis.
Parliamentary Secretary for Communications, Gul Asghar Khan, confirmed that all infrastructure projects carried out by the National Highway Authority (NHA) adhere to international standards.
Khan explained that the design of highways includes a 10-year lifespan for pavements and 50 years for bridges and tunnels. He also stated that the feasibility study for the M-10 Motorway is near completion and that the project will be executed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The M-9 Karachi-Hyderabad expressway will remain unchanged.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402591/weak-disco-performance-added-rs397bn-to-circular-debt-in-fy25-nepra-report,Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report - Business Recorder,"Weak performance by Pakistan’s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country’s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.
The report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with “rigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)” to reduce tariffs were a milestone.
However, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.
“Overall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,” the report read.

The regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the “old era of scarcity is ending”, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might “prove to be even more complex”.
Operational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.
In its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.
Meanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the ‘Take or Pay’ electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.
NEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.
“A significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan’s power system.”
The regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.
“It remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.”
On the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.

At the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.
“Governance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan’s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,” the NEPRA report said.
KE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.
In contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.
QESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402233/bqati-says-concerned-at-cross-subsidy-on-industrial-electricity-tariffs,BQATI says concerned at cross-subsidy on industrial electricity tariffs - Business Recorder,"KARACHI: Shakil Ashfaq, President of the Bin Qasim Association of Trade and Industry (BQATI), has expressed grave concern over the continued imposition of cross-subsidy on industrial electricity tariffs, stating that this policy is directly undermining industrial productivity, discouraging investment, and eroding Pakistan’s export competitiveness.
He noted that industrial electricity tariffs currently carry a cross-subsidy ranging from Rs 4.5 to Rs 7 per unit, adding nearly 20 percent to power costs that are already uncompetitive by regional standards. He stated that industry is no longer in a position to absorb this burden, and many industrial units are operating under extreme financial stress.
Shakil Ashfaq pointed out that despite having a broad base of small industrial units, Pakistan has failed to build and sustain large-scale industry—particularly in energy-intensive sectors operating in the Bin Qasim industrial zone. He emphasised that distorted and punitive electricity pricing discourages expansion, modernization, and long-term planning, forcing industries to remain small, underutilized, or unviable.
He further highlighted that the number of protected consumers has increased substantially in recent years. However, instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal measures, the government has chosen to recover the cost directly from industry. He termed this approach unfair and economically damaging, noting that industry has been treated as a convenient adjustment mechanism even while it faces declining demand, rising input costs, and persistent uncertainty.
Commenting on the Incremental Consumption Package, Shakil said the scheme suffers from serious design flaws and structural anomalies. He pointed out that industries which maintained higher electricity consumption during the reference period December 2023 to November 2024 have been declared ineligible, despite being consistent contributors to system demand.
He also questioned the load factors applied in the package, stating that they have no technical or regulatory basis for an incentive framework. He said these factors appear to be borrowed from theft and detection billing methodologies, which are meant for enforcement and not for incentivizing demand growth, adding that the package has therefore lost its intended purpose.
“This design will not increase overall electricity demand,” he warned. “It will only shift demand within the industrial sector, create artificial distortions, and reward behavior that has no connection to real economic productivity.”
Shakil Ashfaq also challenged repeated claims by the Power Ministry regarding improvements in the performance of the power sector. He stated that if the sector has genuinely improved, a competitive industrial tariff of around 9 cents per unit should already be achievable. The continued absence of such a tariff, he said, raises serious concerns about policy direction and priorities.
He urged the government to immediately remove cross-subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs, correct the anomalies in the Incremental Consumption Package, and align energy policy with the national objective of industrial growth rather than short-term revenue recovery.
He concluded by stating that Pakistan cannot achieve export expansion, employment generation, or economic stability while systematically weakening its productive sector. Unless these structural distortions are removed, industrial confidence will continue to erode and the economy will remain trapped in stagnation.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402872/br-research-lsm-recovery-gathers-real-depth,BR RESEARCH: LSM recovery gathers real depth - Business Recorder,"After years of stop-start recoveries, Large-Scale Manufacturing is now exhibiting momentum that is difficult to dismiss as episodic. November 2025 marked a decisive break from past patterns.
Year-on-year growth of 10.37 percent was the strongest since June 2022, while the November index reading matched the highs last seen in November FY22.
On a cumulative basis, LSM growth for 5MFY26 stands at 6.01 percent year-on-year, with the index reading for the July to November period the highest ever recorded for this window.
More telling than the headline numbers is the breadth of the recovery. On a cumulative 5MFY26 basis, 16 industries are in positive territory, with only six contracting. For November alone, just four industries remained in the red, the lowest count of negative sectors since February 2022. This confirms that LSM growth is no longer being propped up by one or two outperformers, a recurring feature of earlier recoveries.
Sectoral dynamics underline this shift. Automobiles continue to anchor growth, but petroleum has emerged as the standout performer.
On a cumulative basis, petroleum contributed second most to overall LSM growth after automobiles, while in November alone it made the single largest contribution. Year-on-year growth of 44 percent in November reflects record-breaking production. Both petrol and high-speed diesel reached their highest-ever monthly output, pushing the petroleum index to its strongest level since May 2018.
The food sector is also gaining traction. The sugar season has commenced on a firmer footing compared to last year, providing an early boost to food LSM. With sugar carrying the second-highest weight in the food basket, sustained production between November and March could meaningfully lift cumulative food sector growth in the months ahead.
An unexpected boost in November came from the beverage sector, which despite its relatively low weight made a significant contribution to overall LSM growth. The beverage index for November 2025 was the highest ever recorded for the month, and by a wide margin, driven primarily by strong output of soft drinks and mineral water.
Textiles remain under pressure, but this weakness is increasingly being offset by steady gains in readymade garment exports.
While month-on-month fluctuations persist, year-on-year momentum remains intact, aided by a favorable base. Pharmaceuticals, by contrast, continue to underperform overall, though November did offer a bright spot.
Tablet production rebounded to a 40-month high, suggesting early signs of stabilization within a subdued sector.
Transport-related manufacturing continues to reinforce the expansion. Motorcycle and bicycle sales reached 4-year and 6-year monthly highs, respectively, in November, aligning with broader strength across the automobile value chain. These trends are feeding directly into LSM readings and strengthening the case for durability.
Macro conditions are now turning supportive rather than merely less restrictive. The interest rate cycle has begun to ease, energy prices are materially lower than both one year and two years ago, and incentives on incremental electricity consumption remain in place.
Together, these factors are translating into improved capacity utilization and sustained output gains. LSM growth is increasingly resembling a trend rather than a short-lived rebound.
That said, perspective remains necessary. FY22 continues to serve as the benchmark, and it remains out of reach for FY26. To match those highs, LSM growth would need to average close to 15 percent over the remaining seven months, an outcome that appears unlikely.
Even so, the current trajectory suggests that LSM has decisively turned a corner. The damage inflicted over the past few years has been deep, but the recovery is now broader, more balanced, and materially more credible than at any point since mid-2022.","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:22:47 GMT",,"November 2025 marked a decisive break from past patterns.

In a letter to Executive Director Finance Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority Altaf Hussain, Secretary General OCAC, Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi referenced Ogra letter of January 13, 2026, and the meeting held on January 14, 2026, chaired by the Chairman Ogra, wherein various issues concerning the oil industry and the oil industry’s response regarding the recovery of line fill financing cost were deliberated.
The OCAC reiterated that the matter of line fill financing cost recovery-particularly the rate used for recovery had already been highlighted by the industry in its earlier correspondence of July 4, 2024.

Despite this, the issue remains unresolved and continues to adversely impact the financial sustainability of Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).
According to the industry, Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR) is widely recognised as a benchmark reference rate; however, it does not represent the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs.
In practice, banks extend financing to OMCs at a premium over KIBOR, typically around KIBOR plus 2percent, reflecting credit risk, tenor, and other standard banking considerations.
Accordingly, recovery of line fill financing cost at KIBOR alone does not reflect the true and unavoidable cost being borne by the industry.
Based on the financing levels currently incorporated in IFEM, the financial impact of this mismatch for the line fill during the period January-June 2025 un-recovered variance was Rs. 814,231,167 (approximately Rs. 814 million); (i) financing cost recovered at average KIBOR (11.07percent): Rs. 4,508,126,561; and (ii) actual financing cost at KIBOR (11.07percent) + 2percent: Rs. 5,322,357,727.
This un-recovered amount represents a material financing cost currently being absorbed by OMCs. In the prevailing interest-rate environment, such partial recovery is exerting significant pressure on cash flows, working capital, and the overall financial health of the industry.
Continued non-recovery of actual costs is neither sustainable nor consistent with the principle of cost neutrality embedded in the regulatory framework.
OCAC has emphasised that line fill is a regulatory and operational necessity, essential for ensuring uninterrupted and efficient supply of petroleum products through pipeline infrastructure.
Consequently, the financing cost associated with line fill is legitimate, unavoidable, and directly attributable to regulatory operational compliance. Non-recognition of the KIBOR premium component; therefore, effectively results in partial disallowance of actual costs, which is not on merit and undermines fairness.
In this context, OCAC has submitted that Ogra-being the regulator and monitor of the oil industry—has a critical role in ensuring that genuine and prudently incurred costs are fully recoverable.
Aligning the allowed financing rate with the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs, including the applicable premium over KIBOR, would restore cost neutrality, support industry viability, and help safeguard uninterrupted supply to the national economy.
After explaining the issue, OCAC has requested Ogra to review and rationalise the existing recovery methodology for line fill financing cost and allow recovery at the actual financing rate incurred by OMCs. This measure would meaningfully reduce financial pressure on the industry.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40403027/govt-working-on-proposals-to-reduce-industrial-power-tariff,Govt working on proposals to reduce industrial power tariff - Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is reportedly working on three proposals to reduce the industrial electricity tariff to 9 cents per kWh by eliminating cross-subsidy — one of the key demands of export-oriented industries for years,Business Recorderhas learnt from reliable sources.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) determined the tariffs for distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs 33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs 34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26.
For industrial consumers, the B-2 ToU rate has been fixed at Rs 34.47/kWh, B-3 ToU at Rs 33.26/kWh, and B-4 ToU at Rs 33.04/kWh.
The government will notify revised tariffs after incorporating available subsidies in line with its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Last month, the Power Division briefed the highest forum that industrial consumers are currently being charged a base variable rate of Rs 29.25 per unit against the Nepra-determined rate of Rs 23.88 per unit, effectively cross-subsidising domestic consumers by Rs 5.37 per unit.
Eliminating this cross-subsidy would require an additional budgetary allocation of Rs 160 billion per annum — Rs 131 billion for Discos and Rs 29 billion for K-Electric.
Explaining the rationale, sources said the move would make Pakistani industry regionally competitive and encourage higher production and exports. More affordable and predictable electricity tariffs would promote higher capacity utilisation, formalisation of industrial activity, and reinvestment in existing facilities. The reform is also expected to improve power sector efficiency by reducing reliance on captive generation, strengthening grid demand, and promoting a transparent and equitable tariff structure — thereby supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation.
Based on data from the past 50 years, the price elasticity of demand is estimated at 0.22 percent, meaning a Rs 1 per unit reduction in tariff results in additional consumption of 265 GWh. Accordingly, a Rs 5.37 per unit reduction is expected to increase industrial electricity consumption by at least 1,423 GWh. This incremental demand is projected to raise real GDP by Rs 360 billion and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 28.5 billion.
The overall fiscal impact of this proposal would be Rs 160 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.
Sources further noted that the power sector budget has been reduced from Rs 1,287 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs 893 billion in FY 2025-26 due to efficiency gains, and these savings should be utilised to enhance affordability and sustainability in the power sector.
Proposal 2
After removal of cross-subsidy, the all-inclusive pre-tax industrial tariff would be Rs 31.34 per unit — comprising Rs 23.88 per unit variable charge, Rs 4.23 per unit fixed charge, and Rs 3.23 per unit DSS—equivalent to around 11 cents per kWh (at an exchange rate of Rs 280). A further reduction of Rs 6.13 per unit would bring the final tariff down to 9 cents per kWh.
This would require an additional budgetary support of Rs 182 billion per annum —Rs 150 billion for Discos and Rs 32 billion for K-Electric — through fiscalisation of power producers’ debt, with the resulting generation cost relief ring-fenced for industrial consumers.
If approved, this proposal would restore industrial competitiveness, boost production and exports, and drive economic growth. Sources said reducing the final industrial tariff to 9 cents would significantly enhance the global competitiveness of Pakistan’s export-oriented and energy-intensive sectors, encourage reinvestment and expansion, and reduce dependence on captive power generation. Fiscalising legacy power sector debt would separate past inefficiencies from current consumption decisions and strengthen confidence in the policy framework.
A Rs 6.13 per unit tariff reduction is expected to increase industrial consumption by at least 1,624 GWh, raise real GDP by Rs 411 billion, and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 32.5 billion, with a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum.
If the first two proposals are approved, the industrial tariff would be fixed at Rs 25.21 per kWh (9 cents), requiring a total subsidy of Rs 342 billion. However, electricity consumption would increase by 3,047 GWh, real GDP would rise by Rs 771 billion, and additional tax revenue of Rs 61 billion would be generated.
Proposal 3
The third proposal relates to the inclusion of greenfield industries in the Grid Sustainability Package (GSP) 2025. The government has announced the GSP as a subsidy-neutral mechanism to unlock latent demand by offering electricity at the marginal cost of 8 cents per kWh for consumption above a defined baseline.
While the IMF approved the GSP, it did not allow the discounted rate to apply to the entire consumption of greenfield industries. The Power Division has requested that discussions with the IMF be reopened to include greenfield industries in full, in order to ensure grid sustainability, enhance industrial competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth.
The Power Division believes that since the current tariff structure already ensures full recovery of fixed costs through base consumption, extending the GSP rate to the entire load of greenfield data centres, crypto-mining facilities, and copper and aluminium industries would not compromise cost recovery. IMF-approved safeguards — including a 25 percent cap on aggregate incremental consumption, semi-annual reviews, and a termination clause—further mitigate fiscal and system-level risks.
Sources said these greenfield industries, particularly data centres and crypto-mining operations, have significant potential to absorb surplus power, improve system load factors, stabilise grid operations during low-demand periods, and strengthen the financial sustainability of the power sector.
Quantitative analysis using macroeconomic indicators shows that each additional 1 GWh of electricity sales adds Rs 253 million to real GDP. Although aluminium smelting and copper refining are energy-intensive, they generate tradable output and strong local supply chains involving mining, logistics, and exports. While the economic productivity per unit of electricity is lower for data centres and crypto-mining, these sectors still contribute meaningfully to GDP growth and tax revenues.
If approved, this proposal would have a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402780/shadow-economy-primary-hurdle-for-economic-recovery,‘Shadow economy’ primary hurdle for economic recovery - Business Recorder,"LAHORE: Pakistan can still achieve its ambitious tax collection targets if the government takes decisive action against illicit trade. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faced a significant shortfall of Rs545 billion against its original target during the first half of the current fiscal year. This gap reflects massive revenue leakage in the economy, sources said.
According to a study by Ipsos on tax evasion in five sectors, over Rs1 trillion is lost annually to tax evasion and smuggling across key sectors. A strategic focus on enforcement and documentation could provide the fiscal space needed to stabilize the economy without further burdening compliant taxpayers or the formal business community.
The “shadow economy” has become the primary hurdle for economic recovery. The real estate sector alone accounts for approximately Rs500 billion in annual tax losses, while illicit tobacco trade—comprising smuggled and non-tax-paid cigarettes costs the national exchequer another Rs310 billion. Other major industries, including tyres, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, and tea, collectively account for over Rs200 billion in additional evasion, the sources said.
Macroeconomic analyst Osama Siddiqui said because these sectors operate largely outside the documented net, fiscal pressure is unfairly shifted onto a small pool of compliant taxpayers. This creates a vicious cycle where high taxes further incentivize evasion and hinder commercial growth.
READ MORE:FBR’s ‘revolution’: future of Pakistan’s economic sovereignty
Siddiqui said that the solution lies in targeted enforcement rather than higher tax rates. “To meet these tax targets, the government must plug loopholes that lead to tax leakages and intensify targeted enforcement efforts,” he said, adding: “The state should focus on bringing the undocumented sector into the tax net and eliminating smuggling rather than solely relying on existing resources. The ineffective implementation of Track & Trace systems across various industries highlights a lack of government resolve in curbing illicit trade.”
He urged that the path to fiscal sustainability depends on shifting strategy from taxing the “already taxed” to capturing the “untaxed”. Strengthening regulatory enforcement and eliminating illicit trade networks are essential steps to ensure tax targets are met through growth and equity rather than emergency measures, he said.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402267/br-research-hidden-anomalies-in-electricity-tariff-setting,BR RESEARCH: Hidden anomalies in electricity tariff setting - Business Recorder,"NEPRA’s FY26 tariff decision shows a puzzling divergence between consumer classification, electricity consumption, and solar capacity estimates. On the residential side, the number of protected consumers rises to 21.5 million from 17 million in the government motion.
The largest increase is in the 101–200 kWh slab, now counting 12.53 million consumers. Total consumption for this slab remains 3.89 billion kWh, translating to about 26 kWh per household per month. This is far below the lower bound of the slab and suggests administrative reclassification or policy-driven inflation rather than actual usage.
Households in the 1–100 kWh category average 163 kWh per month, consistent with low-consumption behavior. The mismatch compresses per-consumer allocations and raises questions about fairness in subsidy targeting.
On the commercial front, numbers are more consistent. Nepra lists 3.52 million commercial consumers, up from 2.97 million in the motion.
Total consumption remains unchanged. This aligns with 3.5 million consumers recorded in the July 2025 base tariff, suggesting a routine reconciliation of records. The contrast shows that residential slab anomalies are likely due to methodology or policy choices rather than systemic errors.
The decision also addresses solarization. It cites a Power Planning & Monitoring Company (PPMC) report estimating 12,629 MW of off-grid solar capacity, in addition to 6,539 MW of net-metered installations, for a total of nearly 19,000 MW.
The report is not public, and the cut-off date is unclear. Import data suggests that cumulative solar panel imports already amount to around 50,000 MW, far higher than the official estimate.
It is also unclear whether behind-the-meter residential or commercial solar is included. Nepra assumes this capacity will generate nearly 30 billion kWh outside the grid, based on 4.5 hours of daily irradiation, and estimates the impact on base tariffs at Rs3.5 per unit.
The key risk is that underestimating off-grid and behind-the-meter solar could jeopardize demand-side planning and grid management. If actual capacity is far higher than official estimates, the base tariff and subsidy framework may fail to reflect true consumption patterns, distorting financial planning and resource allocation.
The anomalies in residential slabs and the underestimation of solar capacity point to deeper challenges in Pakistan’s electricity planning. Inflated consumer counts in higher protected slabs dilute actual subsidy coverage.
At the same time, official off-grid and behind-the-meter solar estimates fall far short of what import data suggest. This misalignment risks distorting tariff calculations, weakening demand-side management, and complicating grid operations.
Without clear methodology and public access to underlying data, policy decisions may be built on assumptions that do not reflect reality, leaving households, utilities, and planners exposed to unforeseen costs and operational stress.","Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:06:55 GMT",,"NEPRA’s FY26 tariff decision shows a puzzling divergence between consumer classification, electricity consumption, and solar capacity estimates.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402250,SAI president says policy of cross-subsidy on industrial electricity tariffs hurting industrial activities - Business Recorder,"KARACHI: President of the SITE Association of Industry (SAI), Ahmed Azeem Alvi has expressed serious concern over the continued burden of cross subsidy imposed on industrial electricity tariffs, stating that this policy is weakening industrial viability and discouraging scale, investment, and formal growth.
He stated that industrial tariffs are currently carrying a cross subsidy of Rs4.5 to Rs7 per unit, adding nearly 20 percent extra cost to electricity that is already uncompetitive. According to him, industry is barely able to carry its own cost structure and this additional burden has pushed many units to the brink.
Ahmed Azeem Alvi pointed out that while Pakistan has a large number of small industrial units, the country has failed to establish and retain large scale industry, largely due to distorted energy pricing.
He said policies that penalize consumption and expansion naturally prevent industries from growing in size and efficiency.
He further noted that the number of protected consumers has increased sharply in recent years, yet instead of supporting them through fiscal space, the government is using industry as a balancing tool.
This approach, he said, is neither sustainable nor fair, especially when industry already pays in full and on time.
Commenting on the Incremental Consumption Package, Alvi stated that the scheme is fundamentally flawed and internally inconsistent. Industries that consumed higher electricity during the reference period from December 2023 to November 2024 have been rendered ineligible, even though they represent stable and genuine demand.
SAI President highlighted that the load factors applied in the package have no regulatory or technical basis for incremental demand creation and appear to have been lifted from theft and detection billing frameworks meant for enforcement, not incentives. He said this anomaly has completely diluted the purpose of the package.
“As designed, the package will not increase demand,” he warned. “It will only cause demand shifting within industry, creating artificial winners and losers and further distorting consumption patterns.”
Ahmed Azeem Alvi also questioned repeated claims by the Power Ministry regarding improved performance, stating that if the sector has improved, a competitive industrial tariff of around 9 cents per unit should already have been achievable. The absence of such a tariff, he said, exposes the gap between claims and ground realities.
He urged the government to immediately remove cross subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs, withdraw the flawed incremental package in its present form, and redesign incentives on transparent and rational principles.
He states that industrial revival, export growth, and employment generation cannot be achieved by penalizing consumption and rewarding inefficiency. Without correcting these structural distortions, policy announcements will continue to fail in delivering real economic outcomes.

The scale and speed of adoption have exposed structural faults in a system designed for one-way power flows from large, centralized generators. While policy responses are now emerging, failure to align incentives with system realities could still trade short-term gains for long-term grid fragmentation and inequity.
The numbers are eye-opening. With over 50 GW of solar panels imported into Pakistan in just five years, the country has witnessed one of the fastest market-driven clean energy transitions in the region. This surge has dramatically reshaped daytime electricity demand while leaving evening peaks largely unchanged, creating the classic “duck curve” that forces utilities to maintain costly standby capacity.
At the same time, a rapid influx of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is emerging alongside rooftop solar installations. Industrial and commercial consumers, in particular, are increasingly deploying BESS to manage load-shedding, avoid peak tariffs, and insulate operations from grid volatility.
While this shift can improve reliability and flatten demand peaks, its system-wide impacts on load forecasting, tariff recovery, grid operations, safety standards, and end-of-life management have yet to be fully assessed or reflected in regulation.
Yet the financing behind this transformation remains largely opaque. The solar-and-storage boom is being driven primarily by households and firms with access to upfront capital, while lower-income consumers remain effectively locked out of the transition. As a result, the benefits of reduced bills, energy autonomy, and resilience accrue disproportionately to better-capitalized users, even as the fixed costs of maintaining the grid are increasingly borne by consumers with no access to distributed generation.
The release of draft revisions to the NEPRA (Prosumer) Regulations, 2025 reflects an emerging regulatory consensus that Pakistan’s rooftop solar expansion is beginning to strain grid operations and cost recovery. The regulations codify a shift from net metering to net billing, replacing retail-rate compensation with credits based on the national average energy purchase price. This change recognizes that exported rooftop electricity has a system value distinct from retail consumption and must be priced accordingly.
That change in demand has material consequences for the financing of the power system. Transmission and distribution networks, capacity charges, and system-balancing services represent largely fixed or lumpy costs; they do not shrink in proportion to the kilowatt-hours an individual household consumes.
When affluent consumers install rooftop PV and export surplus during daylight hours, they reduce their bills but continue to rely on the same wires, substations, and balancing services every evening. The residual cost must therefore be recovered from a shrinking pool of consumers, many of whom cannot afford distributed generation.
The new prosumer regulations partially address this imbalance by delinking export compensation from retail tariffs. However, they stop short of introducing explicit grid-access or capacity charges. As a result, fixed network costs remain socialized across non-solar consumers, leaving unresolved the equity concerns that accompany rapid rooftop adoption.

Recognizing technical constraints, the regulations also empower distribution companies to refuse new connections where distributed generation capacity reaches 80% of a transformer’s rated capacity, and to require load-flow studies for larger installations. These safeguards implicitly validate the concern that unmanaged rooftop growth can overload local networks, reinforcing the need for planning tools that anticipate not react to distributed generation impacts.
The revised framework reflects a broader fiscal reality. Pakistan’s power sector continues to carry legacy liabilities and circular debt, and the federal government has recently relied on substantial financing packages to stabilize sector finances. In this context, policies that further erode distribution company revenues without addressing cost recovery risk deepening fiscal stress and political backlash.
None of this should be read as an argument against rooftop solar. Distributed PV reduces fuel imports, cuts emissions, and improves resilience. The challenge is no longer whether rooftop solar should grow, but how it should be integrated so that private benefits do not undermine collective infrastructure.
To that end, three pragmatic policy directions remain essential.
First, remuneration must be aligned with system value through the continued rollout of net billing combined with time-of-use tariffs. Net billing alone reduces regressive cross-subsidies, but without temporal price signals it cannot address the mismatch between daytime exports and evening demand.
Second, transparent and modest grid-access or capacity charges should be introduced to ensure all connected users contribute fairly to fixed network costs. Such charges should be carefully designed, with exemptions or lifeline thresholds for low-income consumers, to avoid undermining energy access while preventing cost shifting from large exporters to vulnerable households.
Third, incentives must pivot toward storage and demand-side management. Battery prices have fallen sharply, yet the current regulatory framework remains silent on encouraging hybrid solar-plus-storage systems or compensating prosumers for providing grid services. Without these incentives, the duck curve will persist, merely flattened rather than resolved.
The regulations provide procedural clarity through defined timelines and renewable five-year agreements, but the ability to revise export rates during the agreement term introduces uncertainty for investors. Predictable transition pathways rather than discretionary revisions will be critical to channeling investment toward grid-friendly technologies such as storage, smart inverters, and managed electric-vehicle charging.
These reforms are not unprecedented. Mature markets in Europe and North America have moved away from flat retail net metering toward net billing, dynamic tariffs, and grid-usage fees while preserving strong solar uptake. Citizen empowerment was not extinguished; it was redirected into models that are technically sound and economically sustainable.
For distribution companies, the imperative is to engage constructively with regulators and consumers to implement reforms that are evidence-based, transparent, and phased. Sudden reversals or opaque policymaking invite uncertainty and backlash; predictable transitions mobilize investment in storage, smart meters, and grid-edge services that benefit all users.
For consumers, the message remains straightforward: rooftop solar is a public good, but it is also part of a shared system. Individual energy independence should not erode the collective infrastructure that guarantees supply for everyone.
One critical issue still waiting in the wings is the end-of-life management of solar panels. With an average lifespan of 25-30 years, today’s installations will become tomorrow’s waste stream. The absence of any provision for environmentally sound disposal, recycling, or extended producer responsibility in the current regulatory framework risks replacing fuel imports with unmanaged solar waste undermining the sustainability narrative that solar power promises.
Pakistan’s new prosumer regulations mark a necessary evolution from unpriced exports toward system-aware compensation. But regulation alone is not reform. Without complementary measures on storage, grid-access pricing, demand management, and lifecycle responsibility, the country risks solving yesterday’s tariff problem while sowing tomorrow’s technical, fiscal, and environmental challenges.

https://www.brecorder.com/news/40402448,Power sector: KCCI opposes proposed amendments to two laws - Business Recorder,"KARACHI: Referring to a news item appearing in a section of press, Acting President Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Raza expressed serious concern and strong opposition to the proposed amendments to the Nepra Act, 1997 and the Electricity Act, 1910, which indicated that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) may be placed under the administrative control of the Power Division.
Muhammad Raza stated that the proposed amendments effectively strike at the very foundation of regulatory independence, which is a universally accepted principle for ensuring transparency, predictability, and credibility in utility regulation.
He cautioned that placing Nepra under the direct influence of an executive ministry would compromise its ability to make impartial, technically sound, and cost-reflective decisions, thereby weakening confidence in Pakistan’s power sector governance framework.
He pointed out that independent regulators are established precisely to act as neutral arbiters between the government, utilities, investors, and consumers.
Any move that transforms Nepra into a subordinate body of the Power Division would not only undermine its authority but also raise serious concerns about politicisation of tariff determinations and regulatory decisions, which must remain insulated from short-term administrative or political pressures.
He warned that such amendments could severely damage investor confidence at a time when Pakistan desperately needs private sector participation to address chronic inefficiencies, mounting circular debt, and persistent capacity payment issues in the power sector.
He emphasised that investors require regulatory certainty and independence, and any perception of executive interference would deter fresh investment and increase the cost of capital for ongoing and future projects.
Muhammad Raza further stated that weakening Nepra’s autonomy would ultimately harm industrial and commercial consumers, who already face uncompetitive electricity tariffs and unreliable supply.
An independent regulator is essential to ensure fair scrutiny of costs, efficiency benchmarks, and service standards, whereas an administratively controlled regulator may be compelled to prioritise short-term fiscal or political considerations over long-term sector sustainability and consumer protection.
He also questioned the rationale behind the proposed amendments, noting that policy disagreements between a regulator and a ministry should be resolved through structured dialogue and institutional mechanisms, not by curtailing the regulator’s independence.
Such an approach, he said, sets a dangerous precedent and reverses years of reform efforts aimed at strengthening governance and accountability in the power sector.
Raza urged the government to immediately reconsider the proposed amendments and initiate comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders, including chambers of commerce, industry representatives, energy experts, and consumer bodies.
He stressed that Pakistan’s economic revival depends on transparent, credible, and independent institutions, and that weakening Nepra would be a regressive step with long-term negative consequences for the economy.
