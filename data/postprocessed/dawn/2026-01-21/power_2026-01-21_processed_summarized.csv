https://www.dawn.com/news/1967418,Power sector interventions fail to spark growth - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Despite over 35 years of ‘reforms’ and policy interventions, Pakistan’s power sector remains incapable of instilling confidence in the country’s economic growth and in consumers’ trust, leading to gains secured from power producers through renegotiations evaporating amid unending inefficiencies.
This charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship ‘State of the Industry Report 2025’, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.
It said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.
It said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, “overall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development”.
Nepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt
It pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, many go­­vernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com­me­rcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie­ncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con­tribute to the circular debt problem.
It said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. “Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector’s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth”, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector’s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.
The regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.
It appreciated the government’s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. “Consequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs’ tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms”.
On top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal.
Reduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.
A notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.
The regulator put on record that “KE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators”.
Operational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.
It said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.
As if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement drive had “been diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions”. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement efforts.

In terms of money, the losses mean a total of Rs 40 crores annually and to save these losses, experts said it involves an expenditure of Rs 40 to 50 crores, which can be recovered within two years. To avoid these losses the WAPDA and KESC are required to import capacitors, introduce integrated load dispatching system and use better conducting on transmission and distribution lines... .
Maximum energy utilisation and conservation has become a necessity in the wake of energy crisis since 1973 and consequently the Prime Minister ... approved a proposal to undertake a nationwide energy conservation and austerity campaign.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967628/failed-power-reform,Failed power reform - Dawn,"NEPRA’S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.
In fact, the power sector’s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector’s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector’s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator’s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967414,RLNG price cut by up to 5pc - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Friday notified up to five per cent reduction in the price of regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) at the distribution stage for the current month, mainly due to lower international oil prices.
This is the second consecutive monthly reduction, following around a 6pc decline in December, cumulatively bringing down RLNG prices by more than 11pc over two months. Before this drop, prices had increased by 4.4pc during October and November.
Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, reported distribution-stage system losses of 12.55pc, up from 10.6pc a couple of months earlier. Meanwhile, Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), supplying gas to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported system losses of nearly 9pc at the distribution stage, compared to 7.47pc in October.
According to the notification, the RLNG sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage declined by 4.62pc to $10.41 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for January 2026, from $10.92 per mmBtu in December 2025 and $11.24 in September.
As a result, the sale price at the distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 4.68pc to $11.27 per mmBtu for January, compared to $11.83 in December and $12.24 in November.
On the other hand, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL at the transmission stage decreased by 5.25pc to $8.98 per mmBtu for January, from $9.47 in December, $10.065 in November and $9.86 in September.
The distribution-stage sale price for SSGCL was also reduced by 5.26pc to $10.21 per mmBtu for the current month, compared to $10.77 in December, $11.45 in November and $11.01 in September.
Ogra said the reduction in RLNG prices was due to a decrease in the delivered ex-ship (DES) price. Unaccounted-for gas (UFG) for both companies at the distribution stage had increased two months ago.
Ironically, the RLNG distribution prices of $10.21 per mmBtu for SSGCL and $11.27 for SNGPL are almost $3.3 and $4.25 per mmBtu higher than the average DES price, respectively.
This is mainly because both LNG importers, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL), along with port authorities, charge profit margins on account of retainage at the rate of 3.77pc of the DES price, on top of losses of 8.97pc for SNGPL and 12.55pc for SSGCL.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967807/govt-cites-weather-among-reasons-for-power-outages,Govt cites weather among reasons for power outages - Dawn,"• Leghari says electricity cuts due to fuel mismanagement, transmission constraints, among other causes• Minister contests ‘outdated’ Nepra report, says document should have been shared for ‘fact-checking’• Claims tariff dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 in December 2025
ISLAMABAD: The government on Sun­day conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8–10 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.
Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and ‘mistakes’ in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.
This resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.
The minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.
He said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.
Mr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps — both low recoveries and high losses — were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers’ money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.
The minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.
He said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.
He agreed with the Nepra’s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under ‘take or pay’ or ‘must run’ agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.
‘Without due diligence’
Responding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.
“We have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan’s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,” he said.
The minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.
He also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. “In the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,” he said.
He also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was ‘a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos’. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.
He said the Discos’ recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.
Circular debt
Contesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator’s “understanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising”.
He said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.
Most importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. “K-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric’s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.
The receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,” the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.
Responding to Nepra’s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967028,Power users to continue paying debt surcharge - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday announced that the Rs3.23 per unit debt surcharge on electricity consumers would continue for up to six years as it notified a revised uniform national base tariff for the current year without any change.
In a statement issued on the sidelines of the revised tariff notification for all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, the Power Division said the debt surcharge, currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit, would be withdrawn in five to six years once the circular debt is cleared.
“Once the circular debt is cleared, the debt surcharge currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit will be withdrawn, providing further tariff relief to consumers,” it said, adding that the government had introduced a surplus power package under which industrial and agricultural consumers can avail additional electricity at a concessional rate of Rs22.98 per unit for three years, helping reduce average industrial tariffs.
In addition, a circular debt settlement plan has been launched to eliminate outstanding debt within five to six years.
The Power Division also conceded that the growth of off-grid solar consumption had distorted subsidy requirements, with the number of protected consumers doubling from 11 million in 2021 to 22m recently due to hybrid consumption patterns.
“This has not only strained fiscal resources but has also increased the cross-subsidy burden on industrial and commercial users, undermining their competitiveness,” it said, adding that commercial, bulk supply and high-consuming domestic consumers were currently bearing a significantly higher cross-subsidy burden than the industrial sector.
Responding to criticism over higher energy costs — alsohighlightedby Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as one of the key reasons for the exit of foreign firms from Pakistan and export challenges — the Power Division said it would explore additional options to further reduce the cross-subsidy burden on industrial consumers, including subsidy reforms and debt refinancing, in addition to the tariff reduction measures already in place.
It added that data showed the industrial cross-subsidy burden had been reduced from Rs225 billion (Rs8.9 per unit) in March 2024, when the current government assumed office, to Rs102bn (Rs4.02 per unit) at present, reflecting a reduction of Rs123bn.
“Industrial electricity tariffs (including taxes) have declined from Rs62.99 per unit in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per unit in December 2025, while the national average tariff has fallen from Rs53.04 to Rs42.27 per unit,” it said.
Moreover, to reduce electricity tariffs, the government has terminated inefficient power plants and successfully renegotiated contracts with independent power producers (IPPs). These measures have resulted in tariff reductions, and further negotiations with the remaining IPPs are underway, the Power Division said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1965589,Government mulls fuel levy hike to aid gas sector - Dawn,"• Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months• Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector
ISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
While testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr­o­leum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.
The minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.
Interestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared topetrol and dieselwhich are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.
In the last week of November 2025, Ogra haddeterminedup to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra’s determination within 40 days.
The minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan hadconcludedsuccessful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac­h­ed to manage excess supplies.
MNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector’s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.
The minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been “quelled”, which was a critical reform measure.
Sui gas companies’ managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.
Committee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.
Officials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.
No domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.
The committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.
The minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.
The committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967111,"Explainer: Iran’s economy faces rocky road amid rising prices, falling currency - Dawn","Iran’s economy is going through one of its most difficult periods in years, fueled by sanctions, high inflation, and a significant drop in the value of the national currency, the rial.
These pressures have had a direct impact on living standards and have also fueled recent protests.
The protests began on Dec. 28 in commercial hubs in the capital Tehran, when shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners staged strikes and demonstrations to protest soaring inflation, the collapsing rial, and deteriorating economic conditions, and have since grown into nationwide anti-government expressions of discontent involving workers, students, and others across multiple cities.
The Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran’s economic problems amid the protests. Masoud Pezeshkian said the government admits to “shortcomings and problems” and is working hard to alleviate the people’s concerns, especially on the economy.
The Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. It started last year at around 817,000 rials per $1, then sank to 1.42-1.47 million rials on the parallel market by late 2025.
Due to the rial’s sharp decline, most Iranians have struggled to keep up with steadily rising prices.
The currency has been suffering for years in the face of sanctions and inflationary pressures, going from about 34,000 rials to the US dollar in 2016 to around 270,000 in 2021 and some 430,000 in 2022.
By 2023-2024, the rial had crossed the 750,000 mark on the open market, and its depreciation accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the rial has lost nearly 800 per cent of its value, and as of this week, it trades at around 1.5 million rials to the dollar, severely eroding household purchasing power.
As the rial weakened, import costs shot up, feeding inflation and forcing businesses to raise prices. For ordinary Iranians, the falling currency has wiped out savings, reduced purchasing power, and created fear that prices will continue rising.
Traders and shopkeepers have been among the first to protest, as they struggle to afford goods amid daily currency swings.
Inflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Middle- and lower-income families are increasingly forced to cut back on basic goods.
Consumer price inflation remains exceptionally high, with inflation estimated at 30.6pc in 2020 before rising sharply to 43.4pc in 2021 and staying elevated at around 44pc–46pc in both 2022 and 2023.
Although inflation eased to about 32.5pc in 2024, it is projected to accelerate again, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting inflation of 42.4pc in 2025 and remaining above 40pc in 2026, underscoring the persistence of price pressures driven by currency weakness and structural constraints.
Food costs and staples have grown much faster, with sectoral inflation (such as bread and fruit) substantially outpacing the national rate.
The Statistical Centre of Iran reported that food inflation last September reached 58pc, more than double the rate in the same month the previous year. According to the survey, fruit costs have soared 75pc while bread and grains, which are staples in Iranian households, have almost doubled in price.
Although the government provides cash handouts and subsidies, including monthly payments, and food staple, electricity, and foreign exchange subsidies, these measures have not offset the impact of rising prices, especially as the value of payments declines alongside the rial.
Iran’s economy is still severely hampered by international sanctions. US sanctions limit access to the international financial system, banking transactions, and oil exports. Even when Iran is successful in exporting oil, access to hard currency is often restricted, delayed, or held overseas.
According to aReuterssurvey, Iran’s oil output fell by 100,000 barrels per day in late 2025 due to the sanctions, which directly cut into government revenue.
Total exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, while imports are expected to fall by roughly 10pc to $98bn, according to the IMF, reflecting tighter foreign exchange and sanctions pressure.
In 2025, the IMF projected a 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) decline in both output and exports as of last May. A greater decline of up to half a million bpd has been projected by independent energy analytics companies, including Kpler, Vortexa, and TankerTrackers.
As a result, foreign exchange inflows have fallen, and the Central Bank’s capacity to maintain currency stability has been eroded. Additionally, sanctions have hindered trade and discouraged foreign investment, pushing Iran to rely on unofficial routes that raise prices and decrease transparency.
Iran’s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. In the fiscal year that ended last March, Iran’s Central Bank estimated oil revenues of $67bn. The bank reported oil revenues of $56bn for fiscal 2024, $55bn for 2023, $38bn for 2022, and $23bn for 2021.
However, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the export figures vary. In the calendar year 2018, when the first Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran, oil revenues reached $51bn, according to the EIA. In 2020, they sank to $5bn, before rebounding to $43bn in 2024.
Iran’s fiscal position remains under strain, with the government running persistent budget deficits amid constrained revenues and rising spending pressures.
According to IMF-based estimates, the budget deficit stood at around 4.1pc of GDP in 2024 and is expected to widen to about 6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, before remaining elevated at roughly 6.2pc of GDP in 2026. The deterioration reflects limited oil revenue recovery under sanctions, weak non-oil tax collection, and higher outlays on subsidies, wages, and social support, adding to inflationary and currency pressures.
In its most recent budget, the government estimated daily oil shipments of 1.85 million barrels per day at $67 per barrel. However, the IMF projected that actual exports would only average 1.1 million barrels per day, showing a significant deficit.
Over the last five years, Iran’s economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown.
After a period of lost growth in the late 2010s, GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022, largely driven by a recovery in oil exports and domestic services following the pandemic. This momentum peaked in 2023 with a 5.3pc expansion, but the trajectory has since cooled considerably.
By 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 from the IMF and the World Bank suggest a near-stagnant rate of just 0.3pc to 0.6pc. This recent deceleration is attributed to intensified sanctions, chronic inflation (averaging near 40pc), and severe energy shortages that have hampered industrial productivity.
While the oil sector remains a primary driver of the nominal economy — which fluctuated between $350bn and $475bn — non-oil sectors continue to struggle under structural constraints and a weakening currency.
In addition, the labour market over the last five years has been characterised by a jobless recovery followed by a tightening market amid recent economic stagnation. Official figures showed the total unemployment rate declining from 9.3pc in 2021 to a record low of approximately 7.2pc to 8.2pc by late 2024.
Youth unemployment remains a critical challenge, consistently hovering between 20pc and 23pc, nearly triple the national average.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967505,Search operation begins to locate over 50 missing people at Karachi’s Gul Plaza as fire doused after 24 hours - Dawn,"KARACHI: A search operation at Karachi’s Gul Plaza began after 10pm on Sunday evening as fire crews were finally able to douse the fire after 24 hours, with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah saying that six deaths have been confirmed, but over 50 people were reportedly missing.
According to Rescue 1122 officials, their teams had finally managed to enter the charred building to launch a search for survivors and bodies as the cooling process was still underway.
The fire, which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road, had been brought under control by about 70 per cent by late Sunday afternoon, officials said.
Speaking to the media at around 7pm, CM Murad said, “I say with utmost grief that so far, it is confirmed that six people have lost their lives, including KMC firefighter Furqan Shaukat.”
He added that 22 others were hurt and had now been discharged from hospitals as they had faced minor injuries.
“But what is very concerning […] is that around 58 people — some people even say more than 60 — are missing. May God give them more life.”
According to a list shared withDawnaround the same time, the South district office had received reports of 53 missing people from their families so far.
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
A separate statement by the South Zone police also listed the following helpline contact numbers: 021-99205670, 021-99201196 and 021-99205691.
Hundreds of people had gathered around the building today, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.
During his media talk, CM Murad noted that the mall was a three-storey building with a basement and housed more than 1,000 shops.
While the chief minister noted that the cause of the fire could not be ascertained for sure at this stage, he said a short circuit was being blamed for igniting the blaze in a shop with flammable material.
Terming it a “very upsetting” incident, he stressed that authorities were making efforts to find missing people.
The Sindh CM detailed that around 26 fire tenders, 10 bowsers and multiple snorkels took part in the fire extinguishing operations.
CM Murad, citing what he had been informed, said an alert about the fire was received at 10:16pm, and the first fire tender had reached the site at 10:27pm.
“All municipal authorities acted immediately, according to what I have been informed, and all these things will be verified.”
President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday spoke CM Murad over the telephone to inquire about the latest situation of the fire, stressing the need to use all available resources to ensure the success of rescue and firefighting operations, a statement from the President’s House said.
“The president also paid tribute to firefighter Farqan Shaukat, who lost his life in the blaze, and asked the Sindh government to nominate him for a civil award.”
He directed authorities to ensure proper medical care for the injured and take immediate steps for the rehabilitation of affected families, while emphasising strict enforcement of fire safety laws and the modernisation of safety inspection mechanisms in commercial and residential buildings to prevent similar incidents in the future.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said PM Shehbaz Sharif also inquired about the incident over the phone, offering all kinds of assistance to the provincial government from the Centre.
Pointing out that the mall was constructed in the 1980s, he said, “I admit that we could not control the deterioration that, without any study, multi-level buildings were allowed. And now if we stop them, the builders make a fuss that they are being bothered.”
He highlighted that many buildings do not have materials to extinguish fire available inside the buildings, and stressed the need for fire exits to be properly marked.
At around 4pm, South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso toldDawnthat the fire had been brought under control by up to 70pc.
Speaking toGeo News, DC Khoso said authorities were gathering information about the number of people trapped inside the building.
“We have cordoned off the area and are trying to extinguish the blazes phase-wise,” he said.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Abid Jalal toldGeo Newsin the afternoon that “firefighting is underway from all three sides”.
He also said that the fire had been brought under control by about 70-75pc. However, he stressed that the building was very dilapidated.
“The backside has collapsed, and the front area is also about to collapse.”
Terming flammable material inside the mall as the “biggest challenge” in fully dousing the blaze, COO Jalal pointed out that accessing the building was very difficult.
“Sending firefighters inside right now is not without danger,” the rescue officer said. Therefore, he added, the team’s strategy was to control the fire first and then begin the search once they were able to enter the mall.
COO Jalal detailed that over 125 people, including firefighters, were engaged in the ongoing operations and about 20-22 vehicles of the fire brigade were involved.
ADawnNewsTVcorrespondent present at the site reported that all sides of the mall had been impacted, with one having “completely collapsed”.
He added that several people had come to look for their relatives, including shopkeepers working at the mall.
Delhi Colony residents Mansoor and Jameel toldDawnNewsTVthat they were unable to contact six of their family members who had come to Gul Plaza last night for shopping.
They said their last contact was at around 10:10pm last night, after which their mobile numbers were not reachable. The missing members comprised three women, two men and a 14-year-old girl.
Speaking to the media at the site in the afternoon, Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad said the search for missing people will begin after the fire has been put out and the cooling process has been completed.
“There were goods such as crockery, clothes, electrical appliances, cosmetics and perfumes in various shops, due to which the fire intensified,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan explained.
The spokesperson added that on Sunday morning, 20 fire tenders from different departments and institutions were being employed to extinguish the blaze.
“But the building appears very old, and there is a danger that its structure may fall at any time because of the impact of the fire. Thus, the rescue operation is being carried out with extreme caution,” he said.
“When we arrived, the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames,” Khan toldReuters.
A Rescue 1122 spokesperson toldBBC Urduearly on Sunday that the fire “spread over 8,000 square yards is very intense and the process to extinguish it [fully] could take one to two days”.
Earlier in the day, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed also confirmed that six bodies and 11 injured had been brought to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) so far. State-runAPPreported that an emergency has been declared at the hospital.
In a statement run byAPP, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said “more than 17 people” had been taken to hospitals due to suffocation, several of whom were discharged after receiving medical treatment.
Noting that Gul Plaza was an old building, he said the final cause of the fire will only be known after the completion of investigations. He added that 40 snorkels were taking part in the operation.
A firefighter identified as Furqan Shoukat also lost his life during the fire-extinguishing efforts, according to a statement by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
“In this time of grief, we stand with the family of martyred Furqan and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation will provide full support to its martyred employees,” the mayor was quoted as saying byAPP.
He said teams and machinery are fully engaged in extinguishing the fire.
In a separate statement, Wahab said all municipal departments have been directed to provide full support to the victims.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate statement reported by state-runRadio Pakistan, also expressed sorrow over the firefighter’s death.
He highlighted that Furqan sacrificed his life while saving the public, and prayed for his elevated ranks.
“It appears to have been caused by a circuit breaker,” Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho told reporters at the site, noting that Gul Plaza housed around 1,200 shops and also had a basement.
“The layout and construction of this market was such, and secondly, the nature of the items in it — such as carpets, blankets and other objects made of resins — so the fire is still simmering because of these.”
Garden Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Mohsin Raza also said in a statement on Saturday night that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit at one of the shops, before spreading to the entire mall.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed officials to divert traffic in the area to alternative routes for the safe passage of citizens.
In a statement, he said that the cause of the fire should be ascertained through a thorough investigation. He said that the building should be secured so that the fire does not spread.
The minister said the routes should be cleared so that fire brigade vehicles could access the scene.
A Sindh Rangers spokesperson said in a statement that personnel had been deployed to the scene of the incident.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in rescue activities and rescue operations along with the fire brigade staff,” the statement, which was issued shortly after the fire erupted, said. “Officers and personnel will remain at the scene until the rescue operation is completed.”
The statement further read that in addition to aiding in rescue operations, a contingent of Rangers had been deployed to cordon off the building for the safety of civilians and to ensure traffic flow.
“Alongside fire tenders, Rangers personnel are evacuating trapped people and ensuring the safety of valuables,” the statement read, adding that protecting lives and preventing the fire from further spreading was a top priority.
Traders feared huge losses as their goods were reduced to ashes by the blaze.
While the estimates vary, the All City Traders Ittehad Association (ACTIA) estimated losses worth around Rs2-2.5 billion, including “repair and reconstruction costs”.
In a statement, ACTIA patron-in-chief Sharjeel Goplani said chairman Zahid Amin and other members of the association had conducted an assessment of the affected mall.
Addressing the Sindh government and the prime minister, Goplani said, “Currently, 1,200 traders have suffered losses. This should be compensated immediately.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz expressed their deep grief over the fire at Gul Plaza and the resulting loss of lives.
In a statement reported byAPP, the premier instructed that all possible assistance should be provided to the affected traders and other individuals, and that all necessary facilities should be provided to the injured.
He stressed that all relevant departments should work together in the rescue operation.
In his statement, President Zardari directed that the Sindh government — which is of his PPP — and the relevant authorities “provide immediate and every possible assistance to the affected people and the traders”.
“No stone should be left unturned in providing the best medical facilities to the injured,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Memon, in a statement reported byAPP, said the Sindh government will decide the future course of action after a complete assessment of the losses.
The minister said that whether it is the trader community or other affected individuals, the government will make every effort to provide maximum possible assistance within the framework of law and regulations.
Taking notice of the incident, CM Murad issued orders to Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi for an immediate inquiry into the matter and to prepare a report on the cause of the fire.
CM Murad was briefed about the incident earlier in the day at the CM House by Commissioner Naqvi and DC Khoso, who informed him that the fire broke out between 9:45pm and 10:15pm.
“The fire safety arrangements in the building should be inspected,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement.
He ordered the strict implementation of fire safety rules and action against those whose negligence or carelessness would be proven.
“A fire safety audit should immediately be conducted of Karachi’s commercial buildings,” CM Murad said.
According to the briefing, more than 1,200 shops were gutted in the incident. A massive emergency response was launched, involving 22 fire brigade vehicles, 10 water bowzers, four snorkel vehicles, and 33 Rescue 1122 ambulances.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed CM Murad and Wahab to deploy all resources to control the fire.
Expressing grief over the loss of lives and property, he demanded an immediate probe into the blaze and ordered that steps be taken to prevent such future tragedies.
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah visited the site of the incident earlier in the day to assess the rescue operations.
The South deputy commissioner and Rescue 1122 officials briefed him on the steps taken to control the fire.
The chief secretary issued orders for the deployment of all available fire tenders and additional rescue workers.
Soon after the fire began, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had also visited Gul Plaza, where he was briefed on the rescue and relief operations.
Standing alongside the traders whose shops were ablaze, the governor issued directives for the rehabilitation of the affected.
Prior to his visit, in a statement from his office, Tessori expressed concern over the incident and ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations.
He also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.
Gul Plaza has witnessed fire incidents in the past as well.
InAugust 2016, more than 25 shops were burnt in a huge fire that broke out in the multi-storey market. It was believed that a short circuit caused the fire.
A fire at a warehouse in Gul Plaza inAugust 2008, also caused by an electric short-circuit, destroyed some goods. However, no casualty was reported.
Fires frequentlyeruptin buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
At a conference in October 2025 followingmultiplefireincidents, city planners, fire experts and disaster management authorities raisedserious concernsover the deteriorating state of fire preparedness in Karachi.
They urged authorities to take immediate action to align the metropolis’s fire safety systems with international standards, warning that the current state leaves the city dangerously exposed to large-scale emergencies.
In December, the Sindh Assemblyvoted unanimouslyin favour of an opposition-sponsored resolution that called for the comprehensive modernisation of Karachi’s inadequate and substandard firefighting system.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967040/scientists-recover-genome-from-woolly-rhino-eaten-by-ice-age-wolf,Scientists recover genome from woolly rhino eaten by Ice Age wolf - Dawn,"ABOUT 14,400 years ago, a weeks-old wolf puppy ate its last meal — meat from a woolly rhinoceros — shortly before dying on the harsh Ice Age landscape of northeastern Siberia.
In a first, researchers have extracted DNA and recovered the rhino’s genome from a chunk of undigested meat from the stomach contents found in the puppy’s remains, discovered in permafrost near the village of Tumat. These genome findings provided insight into the fate of this impressive cold-adapted horned herbivore species once common in northern Europe and Asia.
The researchers compared this rhino’s genome to those of two other individuals from the same species that lived thousands of years earlier — about 18,000 and 49,000 years ago — to examine genetic changes over time. In doing so, they learned that the woolly rhinoceros as a species remained genetically healthy until the end of the Ice Age before apparently suffering a rapid population collapse, probably because the warming climate erased their preferred steppe-tundra environment.
For instance, the newly recovered genome showed no evidence of inbreeding suggestive of population decline. Other research has indicated that the woolly rhinoceros disappeared about 14,000 years ago, just a few hundred years after this individual lived.
“With this research we demonstrate that it is possible to recover a high-quality genome from poorly preserved material dating to a crucial time in the life history of a species,” said evolutionary geneticist Solveig Gudjonsdottir, lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution.
“It is a very cool achievement,” said evolutionary geneticist and study co-senior author Love Daln of the Centre for Palaeogenetics, a collaboration between Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The woolly rhinoceros, whose species name is Coelodonta antiquitatis, first appears in the fossil record about 600,000 years ago.
It became one of the many large mammals to go extinct around the end of the last Ice Age, along with such species as woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, mastodons and giant ground sloths, all of which faced ominous environmental changes as the climate warmed, as well as pressure from human hunting.
“The woolly rhinoceros was a large animal, reaching up to around 2 meters (7 feet) tall, and was covered in thick, long fur,” said Gudjonsdottir, who worked on the study while a master’s student at Stockholm University. “It had two horns, a large hump on its back, a stocky build and relatively short legs. The species was primarily a grazer, feeding on grass and low vegetation adapted to cold, dry environments,” Gudjonsdottir added.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967568,"Mbappe, Asencio strike as Real calm storm with Levante win - Dawn","MADRID: Real Madrid ended a turbulent week with a much-needed 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Levante on Saturday, courtesy of second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio, after being met with boos from a restless Bernabeu crowd before the breakthrough arrived.
The win snapped Real’s two-match losing run and offered brief respite after a bruising week. They looked flat in the first half, still carrying the scars of Sunday’s 3-2 Spanish Super Cup final defeat to rivals Barcelona, followed by the departure of manager Xabi Alonso the next day and a shock 3-2 Copa del Rey exit to second-division Albacete on Wednesday.
Boos greeted the players at kick-off, with sections of the crowd also directing chants at club president Florentino Perez. Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week.
Real finally eased the tension when Adrian de la Fuente tripped Mbappe in the box, and the French forward, was spared the jeers, converted the penalty in the 58th minute to extend his league-leading tally to 19 goals.
Mbappe, who appeared in pain in the warm up after a collision with team-mate Dean Huijsen, had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.
Seven minutes later, Real doubled their advantage through centre-back Asencio, who rose to meet Arda Guler’s corner with a powerful header to make it 2-0 in the 65th minute, giving new coach Alvaro Arbeloa a crucial cushion and settling the mood inside the stadium.
“Today was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,” Asencio told Real Madrid TV. “What happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better. The team gave a good account of themselves, above all in the second half. He [Arbeloa] asks us to enjoy ourselves -- to be protagonists, to  dominate, to focus on ourselves and not on the opposition. Little by  little, we’ll get there.”
The win keeps Real second in La Liga on 48 points from 20 matches, one behind leaders Barcelona, who have a game in hand and visit Real Sociedad on Sunday. Levante are 19th with 14 points.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967278,Difficult times - Dawn,"IQBAL works as a driver with a rent-a-car company. He is usually working six to seven days a week. The company pays him around Rs30,000 as salary. He does make some more as overtime, and though that amount varies by the month, on average he gets another Rs20,000 or so. Adding tips to the total, he makes around Rs65,000 per month. He has a wife and two children who are still in school.
Up to a couple of years ago, Iqbal was able to save a bit every month from his income. But the inflation over the last few years has made his budget a lot more constrained. He is barely able to meet all his routine expenses now. Electricity and gas bills have increased a lot. And the food bill has also almost doubled. He is actively on the lookout for extra driving jobs now so that he can get more overtime payment. He has started skipping lunch unless a client is generous enough to give him lunch or money for lunch.
This is not an isolated case. In their article (‘People are eating less’) in this paper last week, Zafar Mirza and Miftah Ismail, giving numbers from the Household Integrated Expenditure Survey 2024-25, have shown that people are indeed eating less and they have had to tighten their belts further to make ends meet. And this is true for not just lower-income groups but middle-income groups as well.
What has made life a lot harder for Iqbal and his family has been a health shock. His wife has blood pressure and diabetes and has recently been diagnosed with some liver ailment. Doctor’s fee, expenses for diagnostic testing and regular costs of medicines have pushed Iqbal into debt. He has been forced to borrow from his relatives, friends and any clients he felt would be kind enough to help him or lend him money.
We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generation opportunities.
Each month is a struggle now. Medical expenses are a constant addition to his monthly expenses, but his income has not gone up and there does not seem to be any prospect of income growth either. He has essentially fallen into a debt trap. He has accumulated a significant amount of debt, which there is little possibility of paying, and has no ability to raise further debt. But monthly expenses continue to be higher than his income.
What is a person like Iqbal supposed to do?
This is not the story of just one household in Pakistan. It is the story of a significant proportion of the population of the country. If people have no savings, shocks can be devastating and can push households into debt and poverty. The most common shock seems to be health shocks. For a household of five to six people — the norm in Pakistan — with one or two earners, and with grandparents and children, health shocks are not a surprise at all.
Diabetes, blood pressure, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and many other ailments — a lot of them requiring medium- to long-term and continued care — are quite common in Pakistan. With 40 per cent or so of children afflicted with malnutrition, youngsters falling ill is not unexpected either.
The state does not provide good healthcare facilities. Public sector provision is not only patchy and of poor quality in general, it is also not available everywhere. And private healthcare is expensive. Whenever Iqbal has taken his wife to the public hospital, he has been told to get diagnostic tests done from private laboratories and he has also had to pay for all the medicines. Only the doctor’s fee is subsidised by the state. But diagnostic tests are quite expensive. Medicines, too, are expensive and have become even more costly over the last few years.
Do bear in mind that we do not provide any income support through our social protection institutions and programmes to those who are above very low-income levels. The Benazir Income Support Programme is for the very poor and does not extend beyond. There are no programmes for the working or low-income poor.
What could be the way out for Iqbal? Can he increase his income? He could try to work more hours. That is not easy though. He could pull out one or more of his children from school and push them into the workforce. But given the unemployment rates in the country, this is not much of an option, especially if the children are still in the early to middle stages of their education. And the loss in terms of a child not completing his or her education is seen in the medium- to long-term damage to the country.
It is at the level of the state that we can actually change things. In fact, it is the responsibility of the state to do so. A large proportion of Pakistanis have fallen on hard times, even a larger proportion has become more vulnerable to shocks than before. It is the responsibility of the state to do something about this. It is here, even in terms of intentions, that we do not find anything. We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generating opportunities for people. And we need to think about extending support to those who are falling on hard times. Probably the best way to do this — and this is being done and has been done in many countries — is to extend health and education facilities of decent quality to all citizens, especially those who are struggling. This could help a lot of people in major ways. But, of course, in an elitist and elite-captured state, this will not happen easily. It will require a major overhaul of the governance system and governance ethos in the country. This, at least for now, does not seem to be on the horizon.

Near village 138/9-L on Monday night, police claimed that a CCD mobile team was on its way for a recovery operation when they spotted three suspicious motorcyclists. When the team directed a searchlight towards the motorcycle, the suspects attempted to flee and slipped while turning the motorcycle.
Police claimed they then opened fire at the police van and the CCD personnel retaliated. Police claimed the suspects abandoned the motorcycle and took shelter in a nearby wheat field.
Police claimed when the shootout ended, they found the body of a drug trafficker later identified as Asad Ali, of 188/9-L.
CCD officials claimed that Asad was wanted in a number of drug trafficking cases. Police also claimed to have recovered 1.36kg of hashish, a pistol, and a mobile phone from the scene.
Police said that his two unidentified accomplices managed to flee in a car and a case had been registered against them. Raids were being conducted to arrest the fugitives.
In another incident in Vehari, CCD claimed to have arrested a drug peddler in injured condition after an encounter near village 45/WB.
Police claimed a police party was patrolling in the area when two suspects allegedly opened fire on them and the team retaliated. When the firing stopped, one suspect was found lying in injured condition with the firing of his own accomplice, while the other managed to flee under the cover of darkness.
The injured was identified as Jamshed, a resident of village 49/EB Vehari.
Police shifted the suspect to the hospital for treatment.
Police claimed that the injured suspect was involved in several narcotic cases and a case had been registered against his fleeing accomplices.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968034,"‘Content to die’: Afghanistan’s hunger crisis worsened by winter, aid cuts - Dawn","In the dull glow of a single bulb lighting their tent on the outskirts of Kabul, Samiullah and his wife Bibi Rehana sit down to dry bread and tea, their only meal of the day, accompanied by their five children and three-month-old grandchild.
“We have reached a point where we are content with death,” said 55-year-old Samiullah, whose family, including two older sons aged 18 and 20 and their wives, is among the millions deported by neighbouring countries in the past year.
“Day by day, things are getting worse,” he added, after their return to a war-torn nation where the United Nations’ World Food Programmeestimates17 million battle acute hunger after massive cuts in international aid.
“Whatever happens to us has happened, but at least our children’s lives should be better.” He was one of the returned Afghans speaking before protests in Iran sparked a massivecrackdownby the government.
Samiullah said his family went virtually overnight from its modest home in Iran to their makeshift tent, partially propped up by rocks and rubble, after a raid by Iranian authorities led to their arrests and then deportation.
They salvaged a few belongings but were not able to carry out all their savings, which would have carried them through the winter, Samiullah added.
Reuterswas unable to reach authorities in Iran for comment.
“Migrants who are newly returning to the country receive assistance as much as possible,” said Afghan administration spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in areas from transport to housing, healthcare and food.
It was impossible to eradicate poverty quickly in a country that suffered 40 years of conflict and the loss of all its revenue and resources, he added in a statement, despite an extensive rebuilding effort.
“Economic programmes take time and do not have an immediate impact on people’s lives.”
The WFP says Iran and Pakistan haveexpelledmore than 2.5m Afghans in massive repatriation programs.
Tehran ramped up deportations last year amid a flurry of accusations that they were spying for Israel. Authorities blamed the expulsions on concerns about security and resources.
Islamabadaccelerateddeportations amid accusations that the Taliban was harbouring militants responsible for cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations Afghanistan has denied.
As winter spreads across Afghanistan’s arid landscape, work opportunities have dried up, while the wave of returning Afghans has swelled the population by a tenth, said John Aylieff, the WFP’s country director.
“Many of these Afghans were working in Iran and Pakistan and they were sending back remittances,” he toldReuters, adding that 3m more people now face acute hunger. “Those remittances were a lifeline for Afghanistan.”
Cutsto global programmes since United States President Donald Trump returned to the White House have sapped the resources of organisations such as the WFP, while other donor countries have also scaled back, putting millions at risk worldwide.
“Last year was the biggest malnutrition surge ever recorded in Afghanistan and sadly the prediction is that it’s going to get worse,” added Aylieff, estimating that 200,000 more children would suffer acute malnutrition in 2026.
At the WFP’s aid distribution site in Bamiyan, about 180km from Kabul, the capital, there are stacks of rice bags and jugs of palm oil, while wheelbarrows trundle in more food, but it is still too little for the long queues of people.
“I am forced to manage the winter with these supplies; sometimes we eat, sometimes we don’t,” said Zahra Ahmadi, 50, a widowed mother of eight daughters, as she received aid for the first time.
At the Qasaba Clinic in the capital, mothers soothed their children during the wait for medicine and supplements.
“Compared to the time when there were no migrants, the number of our patients has now doubled,” said Dr. Rabia Rahimi Yadgari.
The clinic treats about 30 cases of malnutrition each day but the supplements are not sufficient to sustain the families, who previously relied on WFP aid and hospital support, she said.
Laila, 30, said her son, Abdul Rahman, showed signs of recovery after taking the supplements.
“But after some time, he loses the weight again,” she said.
After the Taliban takeover, she said, “My husband lost his (government) job, and gradually our economic situation collapsed. Life never remains the same.”
The United States led a hasty withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in July 2021, after 20 years of war against the Taliban, opening the doors for the Islamists totake controlof Kabul.
As dusk gathers and the temperature falls, Samiullah brings in firewood and Bibi Rehama lights a stove for warmth.
“At night, when it gets very cold, my children say, ‘Father, I’m cold, I’m freezing.’ I hold them in my arms and say, ‘It’s OK.’ What choice do we have?” Samiullah said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967975/pakistan-posts-12bn-cad-in-july-dec,Pakistan posts $1.2bn CAD in July-Dec - Dawn,"KARACHI: Pakistan posted a current account deficit (CAD) of $1.174 billion during the first half of 2025-26 compared with a surplus of $957 million in the same period last year, the State Bank said on Monday.
The government has projected a CAD of around $2.1bn, or within 0-1 per cent of GDP, for FY26, anticipating higher imports driven by economic growth.
Experts believe the changing geopolitical situation could disrupt oil prices, putting pressure on Pakistan’s balance of payments as the country relies entirely on imported oil. They warn that any renewed conflict in the Middle East, such as an attack on Iran, could suddenly affect supply chains and push oil prices higher. Rising oil prices would further worsen the country’s current account imbalance.
The State Bank and the government believe that higher imports contribute to the current account deficit, with oil accounting for the largest share of imports. In FY25, the country spent $15bn on petroleum product imports out of total imports of $59bn. Despite these imports, the current account recorded a surplus of $2bn.
Swelling trade deficit driven by higher imports turns current account red
On Monday, international crude oil prices ranged between $59 and $63 per barrel and remained volatile amid fears of a possible attack on Iran.
According to the SBP data, the current account posted a surplus of $98 million in November, but turned into a deficit of $244m in December. Both quarters of the current fiscal year recorded deficits: $737m during July-September and $437m during October-December.
Although the State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves have improved during the current financial year, they remain insufficient to cover petroleum imports for the entire year. During the first half of FY26, the country spent $7.1bn on petroleum product imports, compared to $7.3bn in the same period of FY25.
The government has set an export target of $60bn over three years, but exports depend 35 to 40pc on imported inputs. Weak manufacturing activity and declining cotton production have increased the import bill. Pakistan imported cotton worth $2.3bn in FY25, and production has declined again this year, indicating that more dollars will be required to boost exports. The textile sector remains the largest source of export earnings.
The current account surplus in FY25 helped stabilise market sentiment and the exchange rate, preventing panic in the dollar market.
The trade deficit widened from $14.5bn to $19.2bn in the first half of FY26, sending a clear signal about future trends. Apart from concerns over higher oil prices, the import bill is expected to continue rising as low GDP growth has increased pressure on the government. The government has been held responsible over the past three years for low GDP growth, which has pushed about 46pc of the population below the poverty line.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967315,"FPCCI warns against widespread textile factory closures, unemployment amid high energy tariffs, taxes - Dawn","The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) on Friday warned that Pakistan’s industrial sector was facing asevere crisisdue to high energy tariffs and heavy taxation, leading to widespread factory closures and job losses.
In December, it wasreportedthat over 100 spinning mills and over 400 ginning factories had become non-operational, triggered by unprecedented taxes, high power tariffs, and a surge in under-invoiced cotton yarn and fabric imports from China and other countries.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, President FPCCI Atif Ikram Sheikh said, “Costly electricity has crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector.”
“Around 150 large textile units had shut down over the past two years,” he stated.
Sheikh urged the government to immediately abolish cross-subsidies imposed on the industrial sector and reduce the policy rate to single digits.
He proposed thatinterest ratesbe cut first to nine per cent and subsequently to seven per cent to revive industrial growth and investment.
Trader and business leader SM Tanvir said that the situation had also been highlighted in the World Economic Forum’s 2026 report, which increased Pakistan’s risk rating.
“According to the report,” he said, “The business activity and employment opportunities in the country are declining, while the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector has been reduced to a junkyard.”
Tanvir criticised tax policies, saying “non-filers face no scrutiny when depositing money in banks, but are heavily taxed”. “It appears the Federal Board of Revenue is working to please banks,” he alleged.
FPCCI officials warned that if the government failed to urgently address the issue of expensive electricity, the industrial sector could come to a “standstill”.
The officials criticised the government and the Power Division for not passing the relief of reduction in electricity tariff to the industrial consumers.
Recently, after NEPRA determined areductionin the base tariff of electricity, the power division maintained that the number of domestic consumersavailingsubsidised rates was very high.
They emphasised that there was additional electricity available in the country, but the capacity charges for unused power units were paid by the citizens of the country.
Furthermore, they highlighted that the industrial tariff was around 12.5 cents per unit in Pakistan, whereas it was around 7.5 cents in India.
They appealed to the prime minister to “remove the industry from the ventilator” and reduce taxes on the export sector to prevent further economic decline.
According to ananalysis, Pakistan’s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed.
It further said that high and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation.","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:35:37 GMT",,"The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) warned that Pakistan’s industrial sector was facing asevere crisis.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968228/japan-restarts-worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant-15-years-after-fukushima-disaster,Japan restarts world’s biggest nuclear plant 15 years after Fukushima disaster - Dawn,"The world’s biggest nuclear power plant was restarted on Wednesday for the first time since the2011 Fukushima disaster, its Japanese operator said, despite persistent safety concerns among residents.
The plant was “started at 19:02”, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) spokesman Tatsuya Matoba toldAFPof the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata prefecture.
The regional governor approved the resumption last month, although public opinion remains sharply divided.
On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters — mostly elderly — braved freezing temperatures to demonstrate in the snow near the plant’s entrance, whose buildings line the Sea of Japan coast.
“It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, toldAFP.
Around 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September.
TEPCO said on Wednesday it would “proceed with careful verification of each plant facility’s integrity” and address any issues appropriately and transparently.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.
The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.
However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.
Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source.
Fourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.
Nearly 15 years after the disaster, “the situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that’s absolutely unacceptable”, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator.
The vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades.
However, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate.
“I think it’s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,” Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, toldAFP.
On January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority.
The petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.
“We can’t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,” it said.
“Making many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo … is intolerable.” Before the 2011 disaster — which killed around 18,000 people — nuclear power generated about a third of Japan’s electricity.
Japan’s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks.
At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test.
“Safety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,” TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with theAsahidaily newspaper.
Japan is the world’s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.
Nearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil — a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power.
Under a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan’s energy supply by 2040 — up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24.
Meanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:45:21 GMT",,"Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967649/artspeak-does-truth-matter,ARTSPEAK: DOES TRUTH MATTER? - Dawn,"
We are said to live in a ‘post-truth’ world. In 2016, the term was named Oxford Word of the Year. While the immediate motivation for the term may have been a description of Donald Trump’s “war on truth”, in reality, the subversion of truth has been a strategy used for millennia by rulers, their emissaries and their spies.
From the Trojan Horse to the falsehood of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, certainty and doubt, trust and deception keep exchanging places, confusing the general populations.
History is riddled with ‘double-speak’. While one hand is held out to help, the other is filling a pocket. Where the world sees genocide in Palestine, Zionists see the ‘promised land.’ Artist Khalil Chishtee made a sculpture with plastic bags of two men embracing while each holds a gun behind his back.
Taking liberties with the truth is justified by advertisers, by politicians and by defence lawyers. It is considered acceptable because people are aware these are strategies and learn to read between the lines. People learn to negotiate fake news, as the saying goes now: “Swipe for truth and scroll for doubt — the algorithm will sort it out.”
Accessing, understanding and manipulating the ‘truth’ has preoccupied and puzzled people across history — and it continues to do so
The real casualty is not the lie, which time always reveals, but the loss of trust. Once, the media, respected public personalities and institutions, and religious leaders were expected to be truthful. Today, the public finds itself undefended, left to navigate a minefield of partisan, managed or fake news. The loss of faith is understandable. Whether in America or in Pakistan, the public feels outrage that the officials paid by their taxes to protect their borders and streets, and manage government, are only protecting their own interests.
Seeking the truth has occupied philosophers for millennia. We often use the word, yet cannot define it. Most people would say they just know in their heart of hearts or simply sense the truth. Samuel Abel, environmentalist and co-founder of the Eden Foundation, concludes we have no need of truth. It’s more pragmatic to accept shared beliefs, such as nationalism, cultural identity or religion, what Socrates called “the noble lie”, even if they are completely made up.
This is because people cannot comprehend the truth in its pure sense or don’t want to face uncomfortable truths. A person need not know how electricity is produced in order to turn on a lightbulb. It is enough to experience the reality that, when a lamp is turned on, the room gets lit.
While reality is an objective fact, truth tends to be subjective, measured by the limits of a person’s own understanding. A car crash is the reality, but how it was caused can have multiple versions, each true in its own way.
In Arabic, instead of a word for abstract ‘truth’, there is haq [reality] or sadaqat [sincerity]. The Quran asks believers to observe reality and act with sincerity. Yet, every Sufi is on a quest for ‘the truth’ and those that apparently find it cannot share what they find. Rumi explains: “A seeker of truth looks beyond the apparent and contemplates the hidden.”
So what is ‘the truth’? Plato describes truth as abstract spiritual perfection. The Sufis believe truth is synonymous with God and can only be experienced through a spiritual journey and not by rational knowledge.
Yet, no one would deny the existence of truth or say it does not matter. Society’s structures could not exist without a correlation with truth: no laws could be formulated, no scientific discoveries made, no parents teaching children correct values. So, how can ordinary people, who cannot follow the Sufi path, access truth? From the earliest societies, humans have turned to the arts to comprehend the universe.
Pablo Picasso said, “Art is a lie that makes us realise truth.” We all know an actor is playing a role, yet we easily trust the truth of the story told. The words of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Bulleh Shah, William Shakespeare and many more protect and preserve universal truths from the ethos of cynicism.
The arts, with their ability to delve into the depths of human experience, bypassing the restraints of rationality, reveal profound insights that are intuitively recognised as truth.

Authorities said the fire, which erupted on Saturday night, was almost contained after 24-hour-long efforts. A search operation was underway amid fears of further casualties at the time of going to press.
Officials initially suspected an electrical short-circuit, but said the cause was yet to be confirmed.
The fire spread rapidly, fuelled by combustible mat­erial stored in around 1,200 shops in the ground-plus-three-storey building, spr­ead over 8,000 square yards.
On Sunday, hundreds of people had gathered aro­und the building, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.
Parts of the building collapsed during the firefighting operation. Tra­ders’ bodies estimated financial losses of up to Rs25 billion and claiming that 5,000 people worked in the shops.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the fire and fix responsibility.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that six men, aged in their 20s and 30s, were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. Post-mortem examinations were conducted and the cause of death was declared inhalation injuries and burns, she said.
Moreover, 26 men, aged 18 to 45, were brought for treatment, with 11 suffering burn injuries, she said, adding that all were discharged after first aid as none of them had suffered critical injuries.
She said “mass disaster protocols” had been activated at hospitals after officials provided a list of missing persons, including women and children, and warned that the death toll could rise.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hass­a­anul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that they received the initial call at around 1:38am on Sunday. He said rescuers were first told the fire started in a shop dealing in artificial flowers on the ground floor before spreading to the basement and upper levels.
He said the building housed shops containing clothing, plastic goods, suitcases and chemicals used for perfumes and cosmetics, while the top level had a roof and parking area.
Rescue teams, including those from Rescue 1122, the Karachi Met­ropolitan Corporation fire brigade, Pakistan Navy and the Karachi Port Trust, rescued around 50 people safely on Saturday-Sunday night, he said.
Another 20 people were rescued in injured condition, but three later died. Mr Khan said two bodies were recovered from debris late on Sunday night, while a 25-year-old firefighter, Furqan Ali, lost his life when part of the building collapsed and debris fell on him.
He said the intensity of the blaze had weakened the pillars, and the rear portion of the building had already collapsed, with the remaining half of the structure at risk.
Quoting Sindh Building Control Authority officials, he said the building was constructed in the 1990s and an additional floor was added in 2003.
59 missing; Rs25bn losses
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police had a list of 59 missing persons. “So far, we have shortlisted seven of them based on their call details,” he said, adding that their phones were last traced to the plaza before being switched off.
Sindh Chief Minister Shah, Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, IGP Javed Alam Odho and other senior officials visited the site and reviewed the rescue operation.
Meanwhile, All City Tajir Ittehad, an alliance of traders’ bodies, said in a statement that its representatives estimated losses of Rs20bn to Rs25bn, including the value of goods and reconstruction costs.
“This is not only the destruction of a building but a source of livelihood for thousands,” it said, insisting that over 5,000 people worked in more than 1,200 shops.
President, PM grieve
President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday expressed sorrow over the death of firefighter Furqan Ali, praising his bravery and offering condolences to the bereaved family, according to a statement from the President’s Secretariat. He stressed that fire safety and emergency res­p­onse systems should be strengthened to prevent such tragedies in the future.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the loss of life and directed authorities to take all possible steps to protect lives and property. “The affected traders and other victims would be provided with every possible assistance,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also spoke to the Sindh chief minister by phone to express sorrow over the loss of lives and offered the Centre’s full support to the provincial government.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967219/europeans-rush-soldiers-to-greenland-amid-trump-claim,Europeans rush soldiers to Greenland amid Trump claim - Dawn,"NUUK: European countries sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland on Thursday as Denmark said it was pressing on with plans for a  “larger and more permanent” Nato presence to secure the island coveted by US President Donald Trump.
The modest European deployments, meant to help Denmark prepare military exercises, sent a strong message of support a day after a meeting of officials from the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to reach any break-through on the impasse.
After that meeting, Trump repeated his assertion that  Denmark could not be relied upon  to protect its autonomous territory, Greenland, if Russia or China ever wanted to occupy it.
Trump says the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to US security and has not ruled out the use of force to take it. Greenland and Denmark say it is not for sale and that threats of force are reckless.
On Thursday, Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, told journalists in Copenhagen he did not have a final figure for the envisaged expanded Nato presence in Greenland. “But it is clear that we now will be able to plan for a larger and more permanent presence throughout 2026 and that is crucial to show that security in the Arctic is not only for the Kingdom of Denmark it is for all of Nato.”
Nato future
Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark, warning that a US military seizure of Greenland could spell the end of Nato. Before Wednesday’s meeting in the US, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun to increase their military presence in and around Greenland in cooperation with Nato allies.
Denmark had about 150 military and civilian personnel working at its Joint Arctic Command on the island.
Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands have said they are sending military staff to begin preparations for larger drills later this year.
In Nuuk, business owner Mads Petersen said it would be strange to see more military troops. “I don’t hope it is the new normal,” he said.
Kremlin rejects Nato talk
Russia said on Thursday Nato’s talk of Moscow and Beijing being a threat to Greenland was a myth designed to whip up hysteria and warned of the dangers of escalating confrontation in the region. Still, any attempt to ignore Russia’s interests in the Arctic would not go unanswered, a foreign ministry spokeswoman later said.
There is currently little evidence that a large number of Chinese and Russian ships sail near Greenland’s coasts.
Part of Danish territory  “has been  included in Washington’s arbitrarily defined sphere of US interests,”  Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
“Against  this backdrop, the myth of some kind of Russian threat, rigorously  promoted by Denmark and other members of the European Union and NATO for  many years, is especially hypocritical.” Both Nato and Russia have  bulked up their military presence in the Arctic in recent years, as  melting sea ice opens the region up to international shipping and mining  activities.
Foreign troops
Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday about 200 U.S. troops were currently stationed in Greenland, which has a population of around 57,000. The scale of the planned European military build-up has not been made public, but initial deployments appear small.
The German Armed Forces were deploying a reconnaissance team of 13, first to Copenhagen, before heading on to Greenland with Danish personnel. Late on Wednesday, a Danish Air Force plane landed at Nuuk airport and personnel in military fatigues disembarked.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967583,21 Burns Road eateries sealed in Karachi for occupying footpaths - Dawn,"KARACHI: As many as 21 eateries on the famous Burns Road Food Street have been sealed by authorities for occupying footpaths and walkways.
District South Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said that the restaurants and other food shops had been sealed because they had placed their furniture on the walkways.
He said that the sealed outlets would be unsealed after payment of fines and undertaking by the restaurant owners to fully comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).
Mr Nabi said that the commissioner had directed all deputy commissioners to take strict action against the “soft encroachments” that hindered the vehicular and pedestrian movement in any part of the city.
He said that most of the shops and eateries were sealed in Arambagh sub-division where Burns Road Food Street was also located.
The DC said that all shopkeepers would have to pay fines and submit written assurances of compliance with the SOPs.
He said that some of the restaurants and shops sealed two days ago would be allowed to re-open their outlets as they had already paid fines and submitted required affidavits.
Meanwhile, the anti-encroachment operation also continued in other parts of the city.
Korangi DC Masood Bhutto said that two restaurants were sealed in in Model Colony and five others in Korangi and other parts of the district.
It may be noted that the city authorities have launched a massive operation against encroachments on footpaths and walkways across the city, sealing several markets, including the largest motorcycles market at Akbar Road, Saddar.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968045,Power generation rises in December - Dawn,"Pakistan recorded 8,488 gigawatt-hours of power generation in December 2025, marking a nine per cent increase compared to the same month last year, according to data released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
Output in December also saw an increase of 5pc compared with November levels, but remained well below the peaks recorded in the summer months of last year.
The average cost of electricity generation climbed to Rs9.6 per kilowatt-hour in December, up 2pc from the same month last year and 56pc higher than November.
JS Research attributes this increase to a decline in hydropower generation in December. Hydropower generation fell 51pc in the month compared to November. Hydropower contributed 18pc to the energy mix during the month, forcing reliance on more expensive thermal sources. These patterns are expected during the winter months.
December’s electricity generation mix was dominated by coal (24pc) and nuclear (25pc), followed by RLNG (17pc). Coal generation saw an increase of 125pc compared to the same month last year, while nuclear output posted modest growth of 3pc.
The data shows the government’s shift away from furnace oil, traditionally the most expensive source of power generation. Furthermore, renewable sources, including wind, solar, and bagasse, accounted for 1.9pc, 0.9pc, and 1.1pc of the total mix, indicating limited penetration of clean energy in the national grid.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:07:49 GMT",,"Pakistan recorded 8,488 gigawatt-hours of power generation in December 2025.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967628,Failed power reform - Dawn,"NEPRA’S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.
In fact, the power sector’s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector’s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector’s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator’s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967619,Late rally lifts equities in volatile week - Dawn,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) endured a highly volatile week but managed to close on a positive note, buoyed by a sharp rally in the final session as easing geopolitical tensions and robust large-scale manufacturing (LSM) data revived investor confidence.
After remaining under pressure due to regional uncertainties and mixed macroeconomic signals, bulls returned with force on Friday. The benchmark KSE-100 index surged by more than 3,642 points in a single session, reclaiming the 185,000 level and snapping a two-session decline.
Despite the dramatic finish, weekly gains remained modest. According to Topline Securities Ltd, the KSE-100 index posted a week-on-week increase of just 0.37 per cent, sharply lower than the 3pc gain recorded in the previous week. The brokerage attributed the slowdown in momentum to reduced inflows from local mutual funds amid heightened geopolitical tensions linked to the US-Iran situation.
Market activity also weakened. Average daily traded volume fell 24pc week-on-week to 982 million shares, while average daily value declined 26pc to Rs58.5 billion, reflecting cautious investor participation.
Friday surge offset geopolitical jitters and subdued trading activity
Key economic developments during the week provided some support. Data released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association showed car sales of 13,280 units in December 2025, marking a 35pc increase year-on-year, though down 14pc month-on-month. Meanwhile, the LSM index posted a strong 10.37pc year-on-year growth in November 2025 and a marginal 0.16pc month-on-month increase, reinforcing expectations of a gradual economic recovery.
The bond market also signalled optimism. In the latest Pakistan Investment Bonds auction, the government raised Rs488bn against a target of Rs450bn, with cut-off yields declining by 59 to 70 basis points across various tenors. The fall in yields reflected growing expectations of a policy rate cut at the upcoming monetary policy meeting on Jan 26.
According to Arif Habib Ltd (AHL), the KSE-100 index remained largely range-bound for most of the week before closing at 185,099 points, up 689 points or 0.4pc week-on-week. The brokerage noted that market sentiment stayed subdued amid escalating geopolitical uncertainty, but improved sharply on Friday due to fresh liquidity, easing tensions and strengthened expectations of monetary easing.
On the macro front, oil production rose 1.1pc week-on-week to 65,444 barrels per day, led by higher output from northern fields amid reduced curtailment. Gas production increased to 3,012 million cubic feet per day, the highest level since mid-March 2025, driven by increased supply to the fertiliser and power sectors. Prices of motor spirit and high-speed diesel remained unchanged at Rs253.17 and Rs257.08 per litre, respectively.
Foreign exchange indicators showed marginal improvement. State Bank of Pakistan-held reserves increased by $16.1 million to $16.1bn, while the rupee appreciated slightly by 0.03pc week-on-week to close at Rs279.95 against the US dollar.
AHL expects the market to remain positive in the coming week, supported by the approaching monetary policy decision and anticipation of a rate cut. The brokerage added that the ongoing corporate result season could provide further upside, particularly in case of positive earnings surprises. The KSE-100 index is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.2 times, offering an attractive dividend yield of around 5.4pc.
AKD Securities Ltd also highlighted sustained volatility during the week but noted that bullish momentum ultimately prevailed as geopolitical risks began to subside and positive macroeconomic developments emerged. The brokerage pointed to defence export discussions with regional partners and strong LSM growth as supportive factors.
Sector-wise, transport, paper and board, oil and gas exploration, property, and automobile parts were among the top performers, while textile-related sectors lagged. In terms of investor flows, individuals and mutual funds were net buyers, whereas banks and insurance companies remained net sellers.
Overall, analysts believe that while near-term volatility may persist, improving macro indicators and expectations of monetary easing could keep the PSX on a constructive path in the weeks ahead.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967027,Equities falter after overnight rally - Dawn,"
KARACHI: After a mild recovery overnight following a three-session of continuous battering, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday came under renewed selling pressure as investors res­umed profit-taking amid a dearth of any positive triggers and mounting regional tensions, pulling the benchmark KSE-100 below the 183,000-point barrier.
Topline Securities Ltd said the bourse witnessed a round of profit-taking as investors chose to lock in gains following the recent rally. The benchmark index remained volatile throughout the session, hitting an intraday high of 775 points and a low of 1,581 points before closing at 182,569.82, down 1,381.69 points or 0.75pc.
Defying the broader market trend, the E&P sector emerged as a notable outperformer. Oil and Gas Development Com­pany rose 2.95pc, while Pakistan Petroleum gained 2.12pc, both closing higher than the previous session amid selective buying interest in energy stocks.
On the index front, heavyweights including OGDCL, PPL, Askari Bank, Meezan Bank, and Atlas Honda Ltd lent support, collectively contributing 429 points. Conversely, weakness in United Bank, MCB Bank, Fauji Fertiliser, Lucky Cement, and Hub Power weighed on sentiment, shaving 897 points off the benchmark.
Trading activity rem­ained subdued, with total market volume fell to 1.031 billion shares. However, the value of shares traded rose 5.19pc to Rs65.9bn. K-Electric led the volume chart, with 56 million shares traded.
Ali Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Ltd, attributed the subdued market momentum to heightened geopolitical tensions, as investors adopted a cautious stance amid escalating uncertainty in the Middle East.
On the macro front, Bloomberg expects Pak­istan’s recent inflation slowdown to 5.6pc year-on-year to be temporary. CPI is projected to reaccelerate due to base effects, stronger demand, and rising energy prices, with inflation potentially nearing 8pc by 4QFY26. This outlook suggests the SBP is likely to maintain its policy rate at 10.5pc, with upside risks stemming from potential oil price shocks.
