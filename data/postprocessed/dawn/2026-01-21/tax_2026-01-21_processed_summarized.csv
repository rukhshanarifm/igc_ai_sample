https://www.dawn.com/news/1966528,Strengthening fiscal federalism - Dawn,"
The outlook for a consensus on the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) award currently appears murky within set timelines, both in cases of vertical and horizontal resource distribution as well as sharing of expenditures among the stakeholders.
So far, the working groups, according to a media report, have made limited progress, which, as per the report, makes it difficult for the consolidation of their recommendations within the time frame. The commission was due to meet in January.
Despite the tough challenges they face, it is incumbent on all stakeholders to join hands to achieve a consensus on the new NFC award, upholding the rights of the federating units.
No doubt, the eight working groups set up by the federal government include issues with no easy solutions. They will recommend the percentage of resources to be distributed between the centre and the four provinces, the vertical transfers, national debt composition and its utilisation, and the inclusion or exclusion of certain taxes in the divisible pool.
Provincial representatives insist on greater autonomy, citing increased tax revenue collection over the past year, even as the NFC award continues to be delayed
The centre, says a The Express Tribune analyst, wants to exclude customs duties from the purview of the divisible pool that is divided among the five governments. According to the Revenue Division Year Book 2025, the provisional net total collection of customs duty by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was Rs1.28 trillion in FY25 or 10.9pc of the total tax revenue.
Similarly, in the NFC group meeting on the sharing of divisible pool resources for the federally administered tribal districts merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), the KP government has reportedly proposed the creation of a 10-year special grant from the federal divisible pool to address what it described as “historical development deficits” in the merged area. The grant, officials said, would bring the region on a par with the rest of KP and the country. However, the federal government says the province is getting its due share.
The International Monetary Fund projects Pakistan’s provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to rise from 0.9pc in FY25 to 1.6pc by FY28, with total collections expected to exceed Rs3.1tr by FY30. The federal tax revenue is expected to remain largely flat during this period. The Fund says the future revenue growth will be driven mainly by provinces.
However, the Fund notes that this provincial revenue increase is contingent on the successful rollout of agricultural income tax (AIT) reforms and an expanded sales tax on services.Significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, including fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities.
Former FBR chairman Syed Shabbar Zaidi says the exemption from the levy of Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act 2011 should be removed, and all retailers and wholesalers should be subjected to taxation under the Act. The jurisdiction of the Federal Sales Tax Act 1990 should end, and registration of such retailers and wholesalers should be transferred to the provinces.
The Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) has posted a robust half-yearly growth of 21pc for FY26 by collecting Rs161.4bn compared to Rs133.3bn in FY25. In December, SRB recorded a surge in revenues by 25pc.
And on Dec 9, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had urged the government to transfer the collection of sales tax on goods to the provinces, saying the provinces have proven their capacity to take the lead in collecting the sales tax on services after the 18th Amendment.
According to the Revenue Division Year Book, the total net sales tax collection was provisionally estimated at Rs3.9tr for FY25 or 33.2pc of the federal tax revenue.
A working group chaired by KP’s Finance Minister will now “deliberate and suggest measures for improving the overall tax-to-GDP ratio”. Notable here is that the KP Revenue Authority recorded a 30pc increase in collection of sales tax on services amounting to Rs23.3bn during the first six months of this fiscal year compared to Rs17.9bn in the same period last year.
The Centre has been levying presumptive taxes on services under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, sales tax on gas, electricity and telephone services and federal excise duty on several services, according to analysts Huzaima Bokhari, Dr Ikramul Haq and Abdul Rauf Shakoori. In a joint Business Recorder article, they wrote that the present situation on the financial front could have been avoided had the centre allowed the provinces to generate their own resources through sales tax on goods.
Despite the constitutional requirement to allocate 57.5pc of the NFC divisible pool to provinces, Dr Hafiz Pasha said they received only 45.8pc in the last fiscal year. Speaking at a Social Policy and Development Committee seminar on NFC recently, he explained that a nearly 12pc share was withheld either by charging petroleum levy on products that are not part of the divisible pool or by getting back transferred money in the shape of cash surpluses. The federal government collected over Rs1.2tr in petroleum levy, and the provinces also saved Rs921bn as cash surplus.
As highlighted in a 2023 World Bank report, the federal government retains ministries linked to devolved subjects and spent Rs328bn on them. A working group will make recommendations on sharing financial expenses incurred by the federation in areas under provincial jurisdiction.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963309,FBR cracks down on healthcare tax evasion - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has intensified its enforcement drive across the country against tax evasion in the private healthcare sector by placing Inland Revenue Service (IRS) officers directly at the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, senior tax officials toldDawnon Thursday.
The move marks a shift toward on-site monitoring as authorities seek to curb underreporting of taxable income in one of the country’s most lucrative professional sectors. The initiative gained mom­entum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.
Official figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan’s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns for TY2025.
Of the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns for TY2025, only 43.20pc of those exist on tax rolls with the tax authorities, placing the profession among the least compliant sectors in the tax system.
Moreover, even among those who filed tax returns, income declarations point to widespread underreporting, raising questions about enforcement, transparency, and the credibility of declared earnings within one of the country’s most established and high earning professions.
Officers deputed at private hospitals to monitor revenue and ensure tax compliance
A senior tax official toldDawnthat the FBR has begun deploying IRS officers directly at the premises of commercial entities, including private hospitals and clinics, to strengthen monitoring and enforcement. According to the official, these officers are tasked with observing the provision of medical services and the collection of receipts in real time.
In the first phase, officers have been posted at 50 commercial hospitals under Section175-C of the Income Tax Ordinance. The objective is to identify underreporting of revenues, particularly from high inpatient occupancy charges that, in some cases, exceed the rates charged by five star hotels.
“We will identify non-compliant doctors through this exercise,” the official said, adding that private notices are being issued to encourage voluntary compliance. The official noted that voluntary compliance from doctors has already begun following the issuance of these notices.
The data place the number of registered doctors on the tax rolls at 130,243, of whom 56,287 filed income tax returns in TY2025, about 43pc of those registered. Among the filers, 48,704 doctors declared income, representing roughly 87pc of those who submitted returns.
Official figures showed that only around two in five registered doctors filed income tax returns in TY2025, with an even smaller share reporting taxable income.
However, 7,583 doctors reported zero income in their tax returns for TY2025.
Further analysis of the returns showed that 30,000 doctors of the 48,704 doctors have declared less than Rs2 million annual income, which accounted for 61.59pc of all doctors who declared taxable income in their returns. This percentage goes to 65 percent of total return filers, who declared less than Rs2 million annual income.
Moreover, most doctors fall in the lower reported income brackets.
Within the below Rs2m income bracket, the breakdown of tax returns declarations further highlights the scale of low declared earnings.
As many as 341 doctors reported annual income between Re1 and Rs100,000 in their returns, 17,647 doctors declared income ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1m, while 12,959 reported annual earnings between Rs1m and Rs2m for TY2025.
According to data, a sharp decline in the number of doctors as income levels rise. The data show 6,655 doctors fall within the Rs2m to Rs3m annual income bracket, 6,959 doctors are in the Rs3m to Rs5m range, and 3,093 doctors declared annual income between Rs5m and Rs10m.
At the highest end of the scale, only 1,050 doctors declared annual income exceeding Rs10m in TY2025.According to the FBR, statistics highlight two gaps, first between registered doctors and those filing their tax returns, and second between filers and the income levels declared with the largest concentration of declarations below Rs2m per year in TY2025.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1962949,Stalled tax effort - Dawn,"PAKISTAN’S tax effort appears to have plateaued. Or so the latest IMF projections stress. After a jump of 1.4 percentage points in the tax-to-GDP ratio to 10.3pc in FY25, largely through additional revenue-enhancing measures that mostly burdened captive taxpayers — the salaried class and compliant businesses — the FBR tax collection as a ratio of the country’s GDP is projected to stagnate for the next five years. The only modest gains, if any, will likely come from provinces, and that too if they decide to effectively tax agriculture income and services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to jump from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27 and further to 1.6pc in FY28 before flattening until FY30. Overall, the country’s tax revenues are projected to flatten at 11.1pc of GDP — much below the 13.3pc mark the government has committed to achieve during the current IMF programme period — all the way through FY30. What the lender is signalling is that the government has ‘exhausted’ its option to raise taxation without fixing the underlying structural problems and better enforcement, or further burdening compliant sectors of the economy, or both.
The government’s growing dependence on non-tax revenue to prop up its fiscal position should be particularly concerning. Though the total government revenues surged to nearly 16pc of GDP in FY25, this increase has not resulted from the expansion of the tax base but from heavy petroleum levy and the State Bank’s profits. The levy has quietly morphed into a permanent quasi-tax on consumption in recent years, disproportionately burdening low-middle-income households. Another worrying fact is that Pakistan’s inequitable tax policy, which is over- reliant on indirect taxes while under-taxing or not taxing certain powerful lobbies, is likely to persist at the expense of economic growth and investment. That Pakistan’s economic growth depends on its ability to boost tax-to-GDP ratio is confirmed by cross-country evidence cited by the Fund: countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc — precisely where Pakistan has been for a while and appears destined to remain. In sum, faster economic growth will remain a pipe dream until fiscal consolidation is achieved through structural reforms instead of what many call stealth taxation.

https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1967132,"RCCI calls for lower taxes, fair regime to spur business growth - Dawn","RAWALPINDI: Emphasising the urgent need for a conducive and business-friendly tax environment to effectively broaden the tax net, the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (RCCI) hosted a high-level meeting with a visiting delegation of the Regional Tax Office (RTO), led by Ms Farhat Qayyum, Chief Commissioner, RTO.
RCCI highlighted that Pakistan currently has one of the highest tax rates in the region, which poses serious challenges to business growth and competitiveness. Addressing the gathering, RCCI President Usman Shaukat stressed that sustainable economic growth is not possible without a fair, predictable, and growth-orientated tax regime.
He urged the tax authorities to reduce the excessive burden on existing taxpayers, recognise and acknowledge compliant and high tax-paying businesses, and shift the focus towards broadening the tax base instead of repeatedly taxing the same segment.
Highlighting the issue of high taxation, President RCCI noted that when super tax and other levies are combined, the corporate tax rate effectively goes beyond 55 per cent, levels more commonly associated with developed economies. He questioned how businesses could remain competitive locally when such high legitimate tax rates are imposed, while better services and facilitation are available abroad at comparatively lower costs.
He emphasised that businesses are willing to be tax compliant, provided the system is fair and facilitative.
He further suggested non-monetary recognition mechanisms for compliant taxpayers such as recognition cards, priority facilitation at airports, and public acknowledgment stating that such measures do not impose a financial burden on the state but significantly enhance the dignity and motivation of taxpayers.
The RCCI president also presented key recommendations, including tax incentives for exporters, reduction in the corporate tax rate, and strong action against corrupt practices and harassment by lower-level staff under the guise of registration, audits, and enforcement, which create uncertainty and discourage voluntary compliance.
In her remarks, Chief Commissioner Ms Farhat Qayyum appreciated RCCI’s constructive and pragmatic recommendations for broadening the tax net and sought the Chamber’s continued cooperation in improving tax compliance and revenue collection.
She informed the participants that digitization reforms are actively underway to curb malpractices, including digital invoicing and POS system installation, aimed at enhancing transparency and minimizing human intervention.
The meeting was attended by Senior Vice President Khalid Farooq Qazi, Vice President Fahad Barlas, former RCCI Presidents Najam Rehan and Asad Mashadi, members of the Executive Committee, representatives of markets and trade associations, various business sectors, and members of the Tax Bar Association.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1966895,Not the NFC’s fault - Dawn,"WITH the constitution of the 11th National FinanceCommission, the debate around revenue sharing takes centre-stage. For years, the federal government has repeated that 57.5 per cent of federal revenues are allocated to provinces, building the narrative that it is cash-strapped. This argument, while politically convenient, is misleading. When one examines the full composition of federal revenues, it becomes evident that the federal government retains close to 60pc of total revenues. A growing share of this is collected outside the NFC’s divisible pool, particularly through the petroleumlevy.
While politically expedient, relying on the petroleum levy and other surcharges as non-shareable revenue is deeply problematic. It bypasses the constitutional principles of the NFC, weakens the mechanism designed to ensure fair federal-provincial fiscal relations, and concentrates fiscal discretion in the hands of the federal executive. By creating a parallel pool of revenues untied to the NFC formula, the centre undermines transparency, and erodes trust in federalism. The narrative that provinces are draining the centre’s resources is false and distracts from structural issues in federal finances.
Another persistent fallacy is the proposal that provincial transfers should be tied to performance, often implying that the centre should oversee provincial outcomes. At first glance, such arguments may seem reasonable: if resources are allocated, accountability appears justified. However, this line of reasoningmisunderstandsPakistan’s fiscal federalism. The NFC was designed solely as a mechanism for revenue sharing, not as a supervisory instrument. Provinces have constitutionally defined responsibilities, strengthened by the 18th Amendment, and conditioning transfers on federal assessment risks violating the spirit of federalism.
Moreover, if performance were to determine transfers, the principle must apply equally to the federal government, whose own failures in tax collection, exchange rate management, and debt administration directly shape the fiscal environment in which provinces operate. One-sided accountability, where provinces are scrutinised while the centre is shielded, reflects political expediency more than economic prudence.
A permanent technical NFC will ensure debates are grounded in evidence rather than slogans.
Equally misleading is the claim that the seventh NFC Award is responsible for the federal government’s growing debt. Pakistan’s debt problem arises primarily from structural weaknesses and policy failures at the federal level. Two critical areas bear particular responsibility. First, the government’s exchange rate management has been erratic and often counterproductive. Persistent overvaluation in some periods, followed by sharp devaluations, has generated uncertainty, inflated the local currency value of foreign-denominated debt, and contributed to high inflation.
Second, Pakistan’s tax policies have consistently failed to raise revenue to sustainable levels. The federal tax-to-GDP ratio remains among the lowest in the region, reflecting poor base coverage, excessive exemptions, and weak enforcement. Together, these two policy failures, poor exchange rate management and inadequate taxation, have driven deficits, forced borrowing, and worsened debt sustainability. Misattributing debt accumulation to provincial transfers allows the federal government to avoid the reforms required to stabilise public finances, including rationalising expenditure, improving state-owned enterprises’ efficiency, and reforming pensions.
Recognising these fallacies is the first step towards reform. What Pakistan urgently needs is a permanent, technically grounded NFC as a foundational layer of the NFC architecture. Currently, the NFC primarily functions as a political negotiation every five years, producing headline-grabbing percentages without rigorous analysis. A standing body of economists and fiscal experts could provide transparent, evidence-based recommendations, track revenue distribution across tiers, model alternative formulas for divisible and non-divisible pools, and ensure transfers reflect a changing development landscape.
Institutionalising technical expertise would transform NFC negotiations from episodic political contests into disciplined, data-driven policymaking, prevent politically motivated distortions, ensure transparency, and build trust between the centre and provinces.
Alongside a permanent NFC, Pakistan must also deepen tax devolution to provinces and cities, but both the federal and provincial governments share responsibility for current weaknesses. While the federal government has centralised tax collection, leaving provinces with limited authority, provincial governments have often blocked local government systems and resisted meaningful devolution. This mutual reluctance has created a cycle in which provinces remain dependent on federal transfers, cities are underfunded, and citizens see limited accountability.
Strengthening subnational fiscal capacity requires reform at both levels: granting provinces and cities meaningful tax powers, including property taxes, and unified sales taxes, while modernising revenue administrations through digitalisation and analytics. Linking local revenue mobilisation to service delivery would ensure that fiscal authority is matched with citizen expectations and that local governments can become viable instruments of governance.
Taken together, these reforms address both the misconceptions surrounding NFC distribution and the structural realities of Pakistan’s fiscal landscape. Clarifying the true share of revenues corrects the false narrative of provincial generosity undermining the centre. Instituting a permanent technical NFC ensures debates are grounded in evidence rather than slogans. Expanding tax authority to provinces and cities strengthens fiscal capacity, enhances accountability, and improves service delivery. Each of these steps contributes to a balanced federal system, where resources are aligned with responsibilities and all tiers of government are incentivised to perform efficiently.
Addressing Pakistan’s fiscal challenges requires more than debates over numbers or blame-shifting. Policymakers must commit to long-term reforms that strengthen institutional capacity, enforce fiscal discipline, and create incentives for all tiers of government to raise and manage resources effectively. By embedding technical rigour into revenue-sharing mechanisms and empowering lower tiers of governments to mobilise and utilise resources efficiently, Pakistan can build a more resilient fiscal architecture. Only through consistent, evidence-based policymaking and cooperative governance can the country ensure that public funds translate into tangible services, economic growth, and trust in federalism for the citizens it serves.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1965569,"FCC questions gap between super tax collection, spending on IDPs - Dawn","• Rs144bn collected, only Rs37bn spent on displaced persons, judge regrets• AAG says 50pc of funds disbursed through provinces; collection reflects govt’s ambition• Counsel questions inland revenue commissioner’s authority to file appeals
ISLAMABAD: Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi, a member of the three-judge Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), on Tuesday regretted that while Rs144 billion was collected under the super tax between 2015 and 2020, only Rs37bn was spent on the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons, observing that the disparity frustrated the very purpose of imposing the levy under Section 4B of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO).
Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman, however, explained that 50 per cent of the super tax collection had been disbursed through the provinces, adding that the overall collection reflected the government’s ambition.
Headed by Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, a three-judge FCC bench was hearing a set of appeals against judgements of the Sindh, Lahore and Islamabad high courts concerning the levy of super tax through Section 4B, inserted into the ITO 2001 via the Finance Act 2015.
The AAG emphasised that the sole purpose of tax collection was social welfare, citing the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) as a prime example, under which the federal government was spending around Rs400bn annually on public welfare.
Earlier, the opposing side argued that a tax imposed specifically for rehabilitation purposes related to social welfare, which had been part of the erstwhile Concurrent Legislative List and, after the abolition of the list, social welfare now fell within the legislative competence of the provinces.
The super tax was initially imposed in 2015 through a Money Bill, with the stated purpose of rehabilitating areas affected by theZarb-i-Azboperation against terrorism. The levy was introduced by the PML-N government as a one-time measure, aimed at rebuilding areas devastated by the military operation. The super tax applies to wealthy individuals, associations of persons and companies earning over Rs500 million. It imposes a tax rate of 4pc on banking companies and 3pc on other sectors to fund the rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons.
During the hearing, the AAG cited the 1991 Sohail Jute Ltd case, in which the levy of Iqra surcharge and customs duty was challenged.
He argued that the Supreme Court had held that mere nomenclature could not determine the vires of a levy. If, in pith and substance, the levy was a customs duty, it would remain so regardless of being labelled as an Iqra surcharge, he contended.
The opposing side maintained that since the super tax was imposed for the specific purpose of rehabilitating displaced persons, it could not be treated as a general tax and, therefore, did not qualify as a tax.
Senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan questioned the authority of the Inland Revenue Commissioner to approach the FCC in a case relating to the super tax.
“When the federal government as well as the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were not aggrieved by the judgements of the high courts, how could the Commissioner of Inland Revenue name both as respondents in the case?” he argued.
He further questioned how the commissioner could sue the federal government when it was not an appellant before the FCC despite having enacted the statute in question, remarking that the situation was akin to “the tail wagging the dog”.
Mr Khan contended that while passing the law, the legislature had recognised that the commissioner, on its own, did not have the right to file such appeals before the FCC.
Advocate Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar, representing the FBR, argued that taxation was a matter of legislative policy beyond judicial discretion. He said respecting parliamentary supremacy and exercising judicial restraint in fiscal matters were essential to uphold the rule of law and national fiscal sovereignty.
He urged the court to uphold the validity of Section 4C of ITO as a lawful and constitutionally sanctioned levy, consistent with Article 25 and international fiscal practice, and said there was no discrimination as alleged by taxpayers.
He also requested that the high courts’ judgements, which he said attempted to dilute or rewrite parliament’s express mandate, be set aside, reiterating that taxation was a matter of legislative policy beyond judicial discretion.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967703/political-system-restored-ppp-enjoys-full-public-trust-ajk-pm,"Political system restored, PPP enjoys full public trust: AJK PM - Dawn","MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore on Sunday said the political system in the state had been fully restored and the people had shown complete confidence in the leadership of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), particularly its chairman, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
Addressing a public gathering in Charhoi, in southern Kotli district, he said the PPP had taken over the government in challenging circumstances to prevent disorder and stabilize the state.
“In just two months, we have achieved what could not have been done in years,” he said, highlighting initiatives including the final stages of converting AJK Bank into a scheduled bank, the launch of health cards across the state, establishment of separate educational boards in all three divisions, and reductions in property tax rates.
Mr Rathore asserted that the government had taken every step in the interest of ordinary citizens, giving them direct access to the Prime Minister’s House and Secretariat, which he described as proof that it is a government of the people.
He reiterated that all demands of the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) had been addressed without delay, reflecting the party’s commitment to public service.
“Our foundation is rooted in the people, and any delay in addressing public issues is contrary to our ethos,” he said. “This system reflects public confidence, and the state cannot afford any disorder. Concrete steps are being taken to secure a bright future for our youth.”
He described the current tenure as a “trial,” saying the real beginning would come after the 2026 elections, when the PPP would again form the government.
“The PPP is the only true representative of the public, which has guided the nation through every crisis. It’s why the public wholeheartedly rewards our party with a mandate to serve them,” he added.
The AJK premier also announced development packages for Charhoi aimed at benefiting local communities.
Addressing the gathering, former Pakistan Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf praised the people of Charhoi for their support to PPP, which he said had always stood by the public during difficult times.
He lauded PM Rathore for restoring confidence and maintaining peace in AJK, predicting that the party would secure a strong majority in future elections through its performance.
The event also featured speeches by PPP Central Secretary-General Humayun Khan, AJK chapter President Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, and cabinet members including Chaudhry Rafique Nayyar, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Amir Yasin, and Chaudhry Muhammad Akhlaq.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967625,Basmati boom propels Pakistan past Vietnam - Dawn,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s rice exports recorded a strong rebound in December 2025, registering a 14 per cent month-on-month (MoM) increase compared to November, primarily driven by a more than 50pc surge in Basmati shipments.
The impressive performance enabled Pakistan to overtake Vietnam and emerge as the world’s third-largest rice exporter, behind India and Thailand, during the month.
According to trade data, Pakistan exported 489,000 tonnes of rice in December 2025, excluding shipments to Iran, compared to Vietnam’s 387,000 tonnes. This marks Pakistan’s best monthly rice export performance, underscoring renewed momentum in the sector.
The UAE remained the top destination for Pakistani rice, importing 74,897 tonnes, including 16,850 tonnes of Basmati. China followed closely with 74,685 tonnes, while other major destinations included Tanzania (62,900 tonnes), Kenya (60,300 tonnes), Ivory Coast (41,700 tonnes), Guinea-Bissau (31,850 tonnes), Malaysia (23,930 tonnes), Madagascar (17,800 tonnes), Kazakhstan (17,050 tonnes), Saudi Arabia (16,032 tonnes, including 5,350 tonnes of Basmati), the EU and UK combined (21,100 tonnes, including 15,600 tonnes of Basmati), Oman (5,770 tonnes), the United States (2,230 tonnes), and Canada (1,321 tonnes).
December surge boosts rankings despite structural challenges
A notable development during December was Pakistan’s growing footprint in Central Asian markets. Exports to Kazakhstan exceeded 17,000 tonnes, including 10,300 tonnes of Basmati, while shipments to Uzbekistan stood at 10,382 tonnes. Industry experts say this reflects a structural shift, as Pakistan is now exporting directly to Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Previously, much of this trade moved indirectly through Afghanistan, but the closure of the Afghan border has prompted direct export routes, making Pakistan’s presence in the region more visible.
Despite the encouraging December figures, the rice export sector continues to face deep-rooted challenges. Structural, financial, marketing, and capacity-related weaknesses persist, with one of the most significant gaps being Pakistan’s negligible exports to Iraq — currently the world’s second-largest importer of Indian Basmati rice after Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Pakistan’s exports to Turkiye, a key transit hub for Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and parts of Eastern Europe, remain minimal.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has recently directed authorities to formulate a comprehensive strategy to boost rice exports and reduce the widening trade deficit.
Government officials have attributed the downturn to low-priced Indian rice and phytosanitary rejections at borders. However, exporters argue that Pakistan’s rice sector is suffering primarily due to policy missteps.
Hamid Malik, a rice sector analyst, says the causes include intense global competition, higher global production — especially in India — weakening international demand, rising ocean freight and logistics costs, inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, irrational regulatory frameworks, inflated domestic prices caused by hoarding and undocumented money, and security-related border closures.
Amid these challenges, Malik sees several positive developments as a silver lining. “There is strong demand for Pakistani rice in Bangladesh, although higher freight costs have eroded competitiveness.”
Central Asian states are also emerging as promising markets since the start of Pakistan’s harvesting season in October 2025. Additionally, a 50pc tariff imposed by the United States on Indian rice exports has begun to benefit Pakistan, with shipments to the US gradually picking up, says Abu Bakr, an exporter.
Another significant development is unfolding in Iran, where foreign exchange shortages have led the Iranian Central Bank to stop issuing subsidised foreign exchange for rice imports. Iranian traders are now importing rice using their own funds, a shift that has favoured Pakistan due to geographic proximity. Pakistani exporters report a surge in Iranian demand, while Indian exporters have been adversely affected.
