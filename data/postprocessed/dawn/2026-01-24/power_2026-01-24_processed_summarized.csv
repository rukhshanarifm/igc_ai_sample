https://www.dawn.com/news/1967807/govt-cites-weather-among-reasons-for-power-outages,Govt cites weather among reasons for power outages - Dawn,"• Leghari says electricity cuts due to fuel mismanagement, transmission constraints, among other causes• Minister contests ‘outdated’ Nepra report, says document should have been shared for ‘fact-checking’• Claims tariff dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 in December 2025
ISLAMABAD: The government on Sun­day conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8–10 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.
Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and ‘mistakes’ in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.
This resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.
The minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.
He said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.
Mr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps — both low recoveries and high losses — were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers’ money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.
The minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.
He said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.
He agreed with the Nepra’s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under ‘take or pay’ or ‘must run’ agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.
‘Without due diligence’
Responding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.
“We have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan’s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,” he said.
The minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.
He also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. “In the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,” he said.
He also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was ‘a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos’. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.
He said the Discos’ recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.
Circular debt
Contesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator’s “understanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising”.
He said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.
Most importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. “K-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric’s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.
The receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,” the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.
Responding to Nepra’s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967414,RLNG price cut by up to 5pc - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Friday notified up to five per cent reduction in the price of regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) at the distribution stage for the current month, mainly due to lower international oil prices.
This is the second consecutive monthly reduction, following around a 6pc decline in December, cumulatively bringing down RLNG prices by more than 11pc over two months. Before this drop, prices had increased by 4.4pc during October and November.
Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, reported distribution-stage system losses of 12.55pc, up from 10.6pc a couple of months earlier. Meanwhile, Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), supplying gas to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported system losses of nearly 9pc at the distribution stage, compared to 7.47pc in October.
According to the notification, the RLNG sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage declined by 4.62pc to $10.41 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for January 2026, from $10.92 per mmBtu in December 2025 and $11.24 in September.
As a result, the sale price at the distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 4.68pc to $11.27 per mmBtu for January, compared to $11.83 in December and $12.24 in November.
On the other hand, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL at the transmission stage decreased by 5.25pc to $8.98 per mmBtu for January, from $9.47 in December, $10.065 in November and $9.86 in September.
The distribution-stage sale price for SSGCL was also reduced by 5.26pc to $10.21 per mmBtu for the current month, compared to $10.77 in December, $11.45 in November and $11.01 in September.
Ogra said the reduction in RLNG prices was due to a decrease in the delivered ex-ship (DES) price. Unaccounted-for gas (UFG) for both companies at the distribution stage had increased two months ago.
Ironically, the RLNG distribution prices of $10.21 per mmBtu for SSGCL and $11.27 for SNGPL are almost $3.3 and $4.25 per mmBtu higher than the average DES price, respectively.
This is mainly because both LNG importers, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL), along with port authorities, charge profit margins on account of retainage at the rate of 3.77pc of the DES price, on top of losses of 8.97pc for SNGPL and 12.55pc for SSGCL.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967628,Failed power reform - Dawn,"NEPRA’S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.
In fact, the power sector’s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector’s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector’s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator’s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967983,Grid issues behind costly power: Nepra - Dawn,"• Transmission system suffers from overloading, underutilisation• 116 of 192 transformers overloaded beyond 80pc capacity• Regulator urges fast-tracking projects, upgrading substations• Says up to 1,750MW of cheaper power frequently curtailed
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s nati­onal transmission system, one of the largest in the world, suffers from a damaging mix of overloading and underutilisation, creating operational constraints that unde­rmine merit-based power supply and impose an unquantifiable financial burden on consumers and the national economy, the National Electric Power Regul­atory Authority (Nepra) has said.
In a detailed review of the national grid system, the regulator pointed out that the backbone of the transmission network — 500kV and 220kV lines — remained “mostly overloaded” at the close of FY2024-25. It said the National Grid Company (NGC) faced critical overloading in several sections of its 500kV and 220kV network, particularly during summer peak demand.
“Many grid stations and power transformers are operating beyond 80 per cent of their rated capacity, risking equipment failure, voltage instability and outages,” it said. In FY25, out of 192 transformers across 68 grid stations, 116 were overloaded beyond 80pc, it added.
Providing a breakdown, Nepra said 30 of 47 transformers at the 500/220kV level were overloaded beyond 80pc. In addition, 86 of 145 transformers at the 220/132kV level were overloaded beyond the same threshold.
Regions with notable overloading included Hyderabad, Islamabad, Lahore and Multan, with persistent constraints at key grids like Gatti, New Multan, Sarfaraz Nagar, Muzaffargarh and Sheikhupura.
“These limitations have led to reliance on expensive generation in violation of economic merit order (EMO) and rising project costs due to delays,” it said.
Ironically, most of these grid stations at Rawat, Sheikhupura, Gatti, Multan, Yousafwala, Jamshoro and Muzaffargarh have been in an overloaded condition since 2017-18 and onwards.
According to the review, these constraints have limited full power evacuation from the 1,300MW Sahiwal coal-fired plant, overreliance on Attock, Halmore, Sapphire and Liberty, limited transformation capacity in the south-central corridor and aggravated bidirectional power flows in the network.
The regulator called for fast-tracking the completion of critical transmission projects, upgrading existing substations with higher-capacity transformers and reactive power support, and enhancing real-time grid monitoring to address persistent overloading in the transmission network.
It said the resulting financial burden could not be calculated under current conditions because assessing the severity and duration of overloading would require hourly digitised operational data to determine how long a transformer or circuit operated beyond its rated capacity.
The regulator warned that transmission system constraints significantly impact the overall efficiency, reliability and affordability of electricity supply. When the transmission network lacks adequate capacity or flexibility, it restricts the flow of power from generation sources to demand centres.
“This leads to congestion, increased transmission losses and underutilisation of low-cost or renewable generation, ultimately raising the overall cost of electricity,” Nepra said.
“Transmission constraints not only raise reliability concerns for consumers but also lead to higher electricity tariffs. This is primarily because, in the absence of adequate transmission capacity, the system must rely on more expensive and less efficient power generation sources, even when cheaper alternatives are available but inaccessible,” it explained.
It said that one of the key challenges in the country’s power sector was the persistent inadequacy of the transmission system, particularly in evacuating electricity from cost-effective and indigenous generation resources located in the southern part of the country.
It noted that the system was often forced to rely on more expensive power plants in the northern region, which significantly increased the overall cost of electricity supply.
Despite the critical importance of resolving these issues, many transmission bottlenecks have remained unaddressed for years. The NGC has consistently failed to resolve them in a timely and efficient manner.
Observations show that nearly every second project undertaken by the NGC suffers from time delays and cost overruns. These delays not only inflate capital costs but also result in operational inefficiencies, such as the forced dispatch of power plants in violation of the EMO, leading to substantial financial losses for the power system.
The south-to-north transmission corridor remains a major bottleneck in NGC’s network, limiting the transfer of cost-effective electricity primarily from coal, nuclear and gas plants in the south to key demand centres in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
As a result, the system continues to rely on more expensive residual fuel oil (RFO) and re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) generation in the north, pushing up generation costs and tariffs.
The regulator cited the example of the overloaded 500kV Jamshoro and Matiari grid stations and their associated lines, which it said restrict power flow to about 1,800MW against available system capacity of 4,500MW. This bottleneck causes frequent load curtailment of up to 1,750MW of cheaper power. Evacuation of more than 2,000MW from Karachi’s two nuclear power plants was another example.
As a related event, the 4,000MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) Matiari-Lahoretransmission line, commissioned in September 2021 over 878km, still remains underutilised due to delays in completing the 500kV Lahore North substation and related transmission lines.
“This inefficiency imposes a financial burden on end-users despite the line’s full operational readiness,” the regulator said, adding that average loading of the line in FY2024-25 was recorded as 1,401.40MW with utilisation factor at just 35.04pc. There are many other such examples of smaller scale, Nepra noted.
The regulator also highlighted weaknesses in grid monitoring infrastructure. It said the original Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, the telecom backbone operational since 1992, had become obsolete due to the lack of hardware and software upgrades, impairing functionality.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968529,AJK warns of tariff review amid surge in electricity use - Dawn,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government has warned that failure to ensure responsible use of electricity could force a review of the region’s existing highly subsidised power tariffs, which may then be determined strictly on demand-and-supply principles.
In a public message addressed to electricity consumers, AJK’s secretary for energy resources Chaudhry Muhammad Tayyab said the government had, in response to public demand, substantially reduced electricity rates for both domestic and commercial users.
“This extraordinary reduction in tariffs has resulted in an equally extraordinary increase in electricity consumption,” he said, adding that the resulting pressure on the system had pushed the power distribution network to its limits.
He explained that electricity demand peaked during winter in Muzaffarabad and Poonch divisions and during summer in Mirpur division, mainly due to extensive use of electric heaters, geysers and, most notably, electric cooking stoves in winter, and the unchecked use of air-conditioners in summer.
Energy secretary says increased consumption pushing distribution network to its limits
“As a result, the power distribution system comes under intense pressure, making transformer burnouts and breakdowns a routine occurrence, which ultimately causes hardship for consumers,” Mr Tayyab said, describing the situation as highly unpleasant for the electricity department.
He said engineers and technicians were working round the clock, repairing damaged transformers and striving to keep the power supply running or to restore it at the earliest. Despite limited resources, he added, the AJK government was making every possible effort to stabilise the distribution network, with valuable assistance from the federal government.
However, Mr Tayyab stressed that meaningful improvement in the prevailing situation was impossible without public cooperation, urging consumers to avoid unnecessary and excessive use of electricity, pay their bills on time, and clear all outstanding dues.
He specifically appealed to people to refrain from using electric stoves for cooking, exercise restraint in the use of air-conditioners, and limit the use of inverter ACs for heating during winter, particularly by switching them off before going to sleep. He also called on households to avoid installing unnecessary decorative outdoor lights and searchlights.
Highlighting the issue of electricity theft, Mr Tayyab urged citizens to identify and report those involved, assuring that the identity of informants would be kept confidential. He said a dedicated helpline for reporting power theft would be announced soon, and advised consumers to immediately contact the nearest electricity department office in case of missing or faulty meters.
The continued “irresponsible use of low-cost electricity”, he warned, would further worsen the situation.
“In such a situation, the government will be compelled to review the current highly subsidised tariffs and determine electricity prices strictly in accordance with demand and supply principles,” he added.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968759,Just deserts - Dawn,"THE Europeans have had a dispiriting week. In the snowy landscape of Davos, leaders of the major European nations had to have a huddle about US President Donald Trump’s escalating rhetoric on taking over Greenland. There were righteous speeches and statements by them about how such a takeover would be the end of the rules-based international order. Canada, which Trump had also threatened with a takeover, got into the game, too, with Prime Minister Mark Carney decrying the rupture in North Atlantic relations and the imminence of a world where force eliminates respect for sovereignty.
It was oddly gratifying to see the world’s political and economic elite, mostly white men and some white women, having to consider how devastating attacks on sovereignty can be and how a superpower gone rogue is a global threat. The rest of the world saw this face of the US post 9/11, in the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, both under the label of ‘protecting US national security’. At that time, Europe joined forces with the US. So, why is Denmark suddenly so bothered with the details of sovereignty, especially given its part in the US-led Nato effort in Afghanistan? Nor did the US care when Barack Obama ordered unmanned aerial bombings of places in Pakistan. Definitions were altered to justify the US bombings in Yemen as well.
All this is to underscore that the international rules-based order that all the white men in Davos are weeping for died a long time ago. Or perhaps their tears simply affirm the truth that these rules were never considered applicable when the sovereignty of various brown and black people was at stake to ensure no one attacked the lands of the white colonisers.
Europe has now discovered it has no recourse against Trump.
The irony of the moment where one colonising power (Denmark) insists that its rights over Greenland are more legitimate than the rights of another (the US, a settler colonial country) must be noted. Listening to Carney’s much-lauded speech, for instance, it was impossible not to recall that Canada’s white people stole land from the First Nations. The temerity of white men who rule stolen lands and then chastise the world about further theft of land represents the disordered ethics that have made white and Western cooperation against the rest of the world a ‘legitimate’ exercise.
Denmark established trade relations in Greenland and its representatives set up outposts on the territory. The Danes realised they had made enough inroads to take over. They then imposed a trade monopoly on Greenland and what had been a trading company transformed itself into an administrative state.
In all the outcry, no one has acknowledged that Greenland’s indigenous Kalaallit populations don’t want to be ruled by either Denmark or the US. As Vijay Prashad of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research notes: “Greenland is always a place that someone else must hold, but not the Kalaallit. For people like Trump, or indeed for generations of Danish prime ministers (despite soft statements about the path to self-determination), the Kalaallit have no role as political subjects.” The true solution is not some backroom deal where the US can get what it wants while leaving Denmark with face-saving control, but a return of Greenland to its people.
The entire debacle underscores what the rules-based international order was really for. True to its origins, which go back to the time when the Great Powers carved up what remained of the Ottoman Empire, the rules-based international order ensures that white and Western nations, either colonisers or settler col­onialists, do not mess with each other’s illegitimate claims on ter­ritory. It also exi­sts to legitimise the use of force impacting the sovereignty of brown and black countries when the aggressor is one of its own.
For most of the world, the international rules-based order has never provided safety. The brutish world where force means the power to bully is one which everyone, except white and Western countries, has experienced. Currently, Europe is in a bind. It had saved money by not spending on military and defence, which allowed Europeans to have easy lifestyles. Europe has now discovered it has no recourse against Trump.
Whatever happens to Greenland, Europe, home to so many colonising powers that caused devastation and pain around the world, is getting its just deserts. Its weak economy and ageing populations are festering problems which America under Trump is likely to exploit. It’s possible that Europe, while superficially independent, will be reduced to a functional colony of the US — dependent economically and militarily on the Americans. If it does, history will have come full circle: that which Europe did to others will now be done to Europe.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968313/europes-far-right-populists-trying-to-distance-themselves-from-trump,"Europe’s far right, populists trying to distance themselves from Trump - Dawn","BERLIN: European far-right and populist parties that once cheered on Donald Trump and gained in standing through his praise are now distancing themselves from the US president over his military incursion into Venezuela and bid for Greenland.
The Trump administration has repeatedly backed far-right European parties that share a similar stance on issues from immigration to climate change, helping legitimise movements that have long faced stigma at home but are now on the rise.
The new US National Security Strategy issued last month said  “the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism.”  But those parties now face a dilemma as disapproval of Trump rises across the continent over his increasingly aggressive foreign policy moves and in particular his efforts to acquire Greenland from Denmark.
AfD berates Trump
“Donald Trump has violated a fundamental campaign promise namely, not to interfere in other countries,” Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany said, while party co-leader Tino Chrupalla rejected  “Wild West methods”.
The AfD has been cultivating ties with Trump’s administration — but polls suggest this may no longer be beneficial. A survey by pollster Forsa released on Tuesday showed 71pc of Germans see Trump more as an opponent than an ally.
Wariness of Trump has grown since he vowed on Saturday to slap tariffs on a raft of EU countries including Germany, France, Sweden and Britain, until the US is allowed to buy Greenland. Those countries had last week sent military personnel to the vast Arctic island at Denmark’s request.
National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said Europe must react, referring to  “anti-coercion measures” and the suspension of the economic agreement signed last year between the EU and the United States. British populist party Reform UK, whose leader Nigel Farage has long feted his close ties with Trump, said it was hard to tell if the president was bluffing. “But to use economic threats against the country that’s been considered to be your closest ally for over a hundred years is not the kind of thing we would expect,” Reform said in a statement published on Jan 19.
Blunter still was Mattias Karlsson, often cited as chief ideologist of the far-right Sweden Democrats. “Trump is increasingly resembling a reversed King Midas,” he wrote on X.  “Everything he touches turns to shit.”  Political scientist Johannes Hillje said it would always be hard for nationalists to forge a common foreign policy  “because the national interests do not always converge.”
Keeping out of the fray
Not all European far-right and populist parties have been so critical. Some, like the far-right Dutch Party for Freedom and Spanish Vox, praised Trump for removing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro yet kept silent on his Greenland threats.
Others, such as Polish President Karol Nawrocki and the nationalist government of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban have called for the issue of Greenland to be settled bilaterally between the United States and Denmark. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis posted a video on social networks on Tuesday in which he brandished a map and a globe to show how big Greenland was and how close it was to Russia if it were to send a missile.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968303,Maxwell and Waugh among franchise owners in European T20 league - Dawn,"LONDON: Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell and former captain Steve Waugh are among the franchise owners in a new European Twenty20 league, which will begin in August after two false starts.
Backed by the cricket boards of Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands, and approved by the governing International Cricket Council, the European T20 Premier League’s (ETPL) founders include Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan.
“Mainland Europe is not known for cricket,” Bachchan told Reuters from Sydney, where they unveiled owners of the three teams, including the Amsterdam franchise owned by a group that includes Waugh and Jamie Dwyer, a five-time International Hockey Federation player of the year.
“It’s an opportunity to create a huge cricket ecosystem in and around Europe. With ETPL, we hope we can bring the magic of cricket euphoria to mainland Europe.”
Maxwell is a co-owner of the Belfast franchise, while former New Zealand internationals Nathan McCullum and Kyle Mills bought the Edinburgh side.
It is expected that deals for the remaining franchises in Dublin, Glasgow and Rotterdam will be completed by the end of February.
The ICC has 33 members in Europe, most for any continent, including full members England and Ireland. Scotland and Netherlands have played World Cups, while Italy will make their T20 World Cup debut next month.
“Italy’s World Cup qualification indicates Europe’s interest in cricket, and cricket being in the 2028 Olympics is another boost for Europe,” Bachchan said. “We hope to turn ETPL into one of the top T20 leagues in the world.”
Waugh, 60, hoped the Amsterdam franchise would inspire more kids to take up the game.
“Franchise cricket has the world’s best players playing with locals,” the two-time World Cup winner told Reuters. “At Amsterdam, the Dutch players will have the opportunity to play alongside players like Mitchell Marsh, the current Australia T20 captain, or Steve Smith, one of the all-time greats of the game. You can’t buy that kind of experience.”
Waugh, who scored nearly 11,000 Test runs, said the opportunity to invest in the venture “stood out because it is driven by aspiration and long-term thinking”.
“In many ways, it marks a return to the game for me, but in a very different role,” he said. “This is about helping uphold the standards and spirit of cricket while supporting its growth into Europe, which remains the game’s last great frontier.”
Maxwell said: “The Irish people love their sport and Cricket Ireland have made huge strides in expanding the game over the last two decades.”
Initially conceived as Euro T20 Slam, the league could not take off in 2019 and its planned launch last year was delayed for the second time. It is expected to start in late August.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968312/worlds-oldest-cave-art-discovered-in-indonesia,World’s oldest cave art discovered in Indonesia - Dawn,"PARIS: A red stencil of a hand pressed against the wall of an Indonesian cave is the oldest rock art ever discovered, scientists said on Wednesday, and sheds light on how humans first migrated to Australia.
The cave art dates back at least 67,800 years, according to research published in the journal Nature by a team of Indonesian and Australian archaeologists. “We have been working in Indonesia for a long time,” study co-author Maxime Aubert of Australia’s Griffith University said.
This time they ventured to caves on the island of Muna in the Sulawesi province on the advice of Indonesian archaeologist Adhi Agus Oktaviana, the study’s lead author. There they found  “handprints in negative, stencilled, probably using red ochre,” Aubert said. The fingers of one of the hands were  “retouched to become pointed like claws — a style of painting only seen in Sulawesi,” the Canadian archaeologist added.
To determine the art’s age, the team took five-millimetre samples from  “cave popcorn”, which are small clusters of calcite that form on the walls of limestone caves. Then they zapped the layers of rock with a laser to measure how the uranium decayed over time, compared to a more stable radioactive element called thorium.
This  “very precise” technique gave the scientists a clear minimum age for the painting, Aubert explained.
At 67,800 years old, the Indonesian stencil is more than a thousand years older than other hand stencils found in a Spanish cave which has been attributed to Neanderthals.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968294,Andresen upstages stars to win Tour Down Under opener - Dawn,"ADELAIDE: Denmark’s Tobias Lund Andresen upstaged a crack field of sprinters in a hectic finish to win the first stage of the Tour Down Under on Wednesday.
Andresen, riding for Decathlon CMA CGM, surged to the front in the main street of Tanunda, near Adelaide.
The Dane held off storming finishes from England’s Matthew Brennan (Team Visma) and Australia’s Sam Welsford (Ineos Grenadiers) to take the 120.6km stage in the UCI World Tour season opener.
The 23-year-old leads by one second in the general classification over Tuesday’s Prologue winner Sam Watson (Ineos Grenadiers) with England’s Ethan Vernon (NSN Cycling Team) a further second behind in third.
It was Andresen’s first race with his new French team and timed his finish perfectly, coming off the wheel of Vernon and dashing clear while Brennan and Welsford had to angle their way through traffic.
“This is unbelievable, riding for the new team, the bike is so fast and my teammates did an incredible job,” Andresen said.
“You need to be a little bit stupid to be a sprinter and enjoy a finish like this and we did exactly what we wanted to do.
“It’s not often you can do what you want to do but today we managed to pull it off.”
Brennan, who enjoyed a stellar 2025 season, including stage wins in the Volta a Catalunya, Tour de Romandie and Tour of Poland, just edged out Welsford, who was bidding for his seventh stage win in the Tour Down Under.
“We kind of got a little bit swamped just on the finish. I got stuck in the barriers there and couldn’t really get out,” Welsford said.
“I’m just kicking myself because I had to stop pedalling with 20 metres to the line. It is what it is.”
Defending champion Jhonatan Narvaez (UAE Team Emirates), who won an early intermediate sprint, finished 26th.
Dutchman Max van der Meulen (Bahrain Victorious) had a heavy fall early in the stage and was taken to hospital for observation with the team reporting he was conscious.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968335,"Delhi’s move on IWT threatens stability, Pakistan warns UN - Dawn","WASHINGTON: Pakistan has warned that India’s unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance has created an unprecedented crisis for Pakistan’s water security and regional stability.
Calling the move deliberate “weaponisation of water”, Pakistan’s representative to the United Nations Ambassador Usman Jadoon said India’s actions amounted to material breaches of the landmark 1960 treaty.
Speaking at the Global Water Bankruptcy Policy Roundtable, hosted by Canada and the United Nations University on Tuesday, Ambassador Jadoon said that India had committed several serious violations of the treaty, including unannounced disruptions of downstream water flows and the withholding of critical hydrological data, since April 2025.
“Pakistan’s position is unequivocal; the treaty remains legally intact and permits no unilateral suspension or modification,” he said.
Slams ‘weaponisation of water’, urges world to recognise water insecurity as a systemic global risk
He stressed that for more than six decades, the Indus Waters Treaty had provided a time-tested framework for the equitable and predictable management of the Indus River basin, which sustains one of the world’s largest contiguous irrigation systems.
The basin, he noted, provides over 80 per cent of Pakistan’s agricultural water needs and supports the lives and livelihoods of more than 240 million people.
Ambassador Jadoon said water insecurity had emerged globally as a systemic risk, affecting food production, energy systems, public health, livelihoods, and human security.
“For Pakistan, this is a lived reality,” he said, describing the country as a semi-arid, climate-vulnerable, lower-riparian state facing floods, droughts, accelerated glacier melt, groundwater depletion, and rapid population growth — all of which are placing immense pressure on already stressed water systems.
Highlighting Pakistan’s response, he said the country was strengthening water resilience through integrated planning, flood protection, irrigation rehabilitation, groundwater replenishment, and ecosystem restoration.
He cited initiatives such as ‘Living Indus’ and ‘Recharge Pakistan’ as key national efforts. However, he emphasized that systemic water risks could not be managed by any country in isolation, particularly in shared river basins.
Predictability, transparency, and cooperation in trans-boundary water governance, he said, were matters of survival for downstream populations.
Ambassador Jadoon further called for water insecurity to be formally recognised as a systemic global risk in the lead-up to the 2026 UN Water Conference, urging that cooperation and respect for international water law be placed at the center of shared water governance to ensure real protection for vulnerable downstream communities.

A 10-member high-level Reconnaissance Mission of subject matter experts from the ADB, led by Mr Suenghyun Kim, Senior Transport Specialist, visited the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) to review existing and future port–rail connectivity and assess related logistics infrastructure.
Following earlier engagements with the government, the reconnaissance mission represents ADB’s initial step toward revitalising rail connectivity to Pakistan’s ports, a KPT press release said.
The delegation was briefed on KPT’s cargo-handling capabilities, its role as Pakistan’s maritime gateway, and the port’s strategic connectivity requirements for efficient inland cargo movement. Discussions also covered KPT’s ongoing and planned development initiatives aimed at enhancing operational efficiency, including dredging, increasing draught depth, and strengthening multimodal integration with terminal operators.
KPT Chairman retired Rear Admiral Shahid Ahmed highlighted that, at present, cargo from Karachi Port is transported by road trailers, leading to severe urban congestion and increased road safety risks due to heavy traffic.
He said KPT’s cargo-handling operations run round the clock, but the movement of trailers out of the port is restricted until after 11pm, creating a critical bottleneck in cargo transshipment.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967028,Power users to continue paying debt surcharge - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday announced that the Rs3.23 per unit debt surcharge on electricity consumers would continue for up to six years as it notified a revised uniform national base tariff for the current year without any change.
In a statement issued on the sidelines of the revised tariff notification for all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, the Power Division said the debt surcharge, currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit, would be withdrawn in five to six years once the circular debt is cleared.
“Once the circular debt is cleared, the debt surcharge currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit will be withdrawn, providing further tariff relief to consumers,” it said, adding that the government had introduced a surplus power package under which industrial and agricultural consumers can avail additional electricity at a concessional rate of Rs22.98 per unit for three years, helping reduce average industrial tariffs.
In addition, a circular debt settlement plan has been launched to eliminate outstanding debt within five to six years.
The Power Division also conceded that the growth of off-grid solar consumption had distorted subsidy requirements, with the number of protected consumers doubling from 11 million in 2021 to 22m recently due to hybrid consumption patterns.
“This has not only strained fiscal resources but has also increased the cross-subsidy burden on industrial and commercial users, undermining their competitiveness,” it said, adding that commercial, bulk supply and high-consuming domestic consumers were currently bearing a significantly higher cross-subsidy burden than the industrial sector.
Responding to criticism over higher energy costs — alsohighlightedby Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as one of the key reasons for the exit of foreign firms from Pakistan and export challenges — the Power Division said it would explore additional options to further reduce the cross-subsidy burden on industrial consumers, including subsidy reforms and debt refinancing, in addition to the tariff reduction measures already in place.
It added that data showed the industrial cross-subsidy burden had been reduced from Rs225 billion (Rs8.9 per unit) in March 2024, when the current government assumed office, to Rs102bn (Rs4.02 per unit) at present, reflecting a reduction of Rs123bn.
“Industrial electricity tariffs (including taxes) have declined from Rs62.99 per unit in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per unit in December 2025, while the national average tariff has fallen from Rs53.04 to Rs42.27 per unit,” it said.
Moreover, to reduce electricity tariffs, the government has terminated inefficient power plants and successfully renegotiated contracts with independent power producers (IPPs). These measures have resulted in tariff reductions, and further negotiations with the remaining IPPs are underway, the Power Division said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967418,Power sector interventions fail to spark growth - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Despite over 35 years of ‘reforms’ and policy interventions, Pakistan’s power sector remains incapable of instilling confidence in the country’s economic growth and in consumers’ trust, leading to gains secured from power producers through renegotiations evaporating amid unending inefficiencies.
This charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship ‘State of the Industry Report 2025’, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.
It said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.
It said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, “overall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development”.
Nepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt
It pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, many go­­vernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com­me­rcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie­ncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con­tribute to the circular debt problem.
It said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. “Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector’s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth”, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector’s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.
The regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.
It appreciated the government’s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. “Consequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs’ tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms”.
On top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal.
Reduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.
A notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.
The regulator put on record that “KE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators”.
Operational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.
It said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.
As if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement drive had “been diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions”. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement efforts.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1965589,Government mulls fuel levy hike to aid gas sector - Dawn,"• Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months• Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector
ISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
While testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr­o­leum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.
The minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.
Interestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared topetrol and dieselwhich are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.
In the last week of November 2025, Ogra haddeterminedup to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra’s determination within 40 days.
The minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan hadconcludedsuccessful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac­h­ed to manage excess supplies.
MNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector’s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.
The minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been “quelled”, which was a critical reform measure.
Sui gas companies’ managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.
Committee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.
Officials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.
No domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.
The committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.
The minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.
The committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.

Output in December also saw an increase of 5pc compared with November levels, but remained well below the peaks recorded in the summer months of last year.
The average cost of electricity generation climbed to Rs9.6 per kilowatt-hour in December, up 2pc from the same month last year and 56pc higher than November.
JS Research attributes this increase to a decline in hydropower generation in December. Hydropower generation fell 51pc in the month compared to November. Hydropower contributed 18pc to the energy mix during the month, forcing reliance on more expensive thermal sources. These patterns are expected during the winter months.
December’s electricity generation mix was dominated by coal (24pc) and nuclear (25pc), followed by RLNG (17pc). Coal generation saw an increase of 125pc compared to the same month last year, while nuclear output posted modest growth of 3pc.
The data shows the government’s shift away from furnace oil, traditionally the most expensive source of power generation. Furthermore, renewable sources, including wind, solar, and bagasse, accounted for 1.9pc, 0.9pc, and 1.1pc of the total mix, indicating limited penetration of clean energy in the national grid.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:07:49 GMT",,power sector debt,"Pakistan recorded 8,488 gigawatt-hours of power generation in December 2025, marking a nine per cent increase compared to the same month last year.Output in December also saw an increase of 5pc compared with November levels, but remained well below the peaks recorded in the summer months.",1.908146858215332,True,0.6672568917274475,electricity tariff and pricing

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967659/addressing-inefficiencies,Addressing inefficiencies - Dawn,"Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar’s remarks at a business conference last week reflect growing political pressure on the government to redirect the sluggish economy, which has produced the decades-high levels of unemployment and poverty in the last two to three years, towards growth. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government would now focus on increasing national output until the end of his tenure, arguing that jobs can only be generated through sustained economic expansion.
“After achieving stability, we will now move towards economic growth and will engage the International Monetary Fund [IMF] as well,” he declared at the Pakistan Policy Dialogue organised by the Policy Research and Advisory Council (PRAC) in Islamabad.
His pronouncement came days after planning minister Ahsan Iqbal had expressed similar thoughts, saying a panel led by him had proposed to the prime minister after consultations with stakeholders to declare “export emergency” to put the country back on the road to growth after a prolonged period of stabilisation under the IMF.
The planned export emergency will target to raise exports by 40 per cent over four years and by around 200pc in 10 years by removing administrative bottlenecks faced by exporters in order to end the country’s dependence on the IMF bailouts.
Critics of stabilisation highlight the increasingly visible socioeconomic costs of prolonged economic stagnation
Mr Dar said, given the country’s annual population growth of 2.6pc, an economic expansion below this rate effectively amounts to negative growth, and that this view was shared with the prime minister in recent discussions over the state of the economy. His assertion that the IMF programmes are “generally anti-growth” reflects both political pressure from within and beyond the ruling PML-N, as well as the economic fatigue being felt by businesses and ordinary people.
The statements of the two key government ministers, especially Mr Dar, who holds sway over most economic policy matters, signify the urgency of the situation amid reports that certain powerful quarters are not happy with the economy’s weak performance and are pushing for changes in the government’s finance team and economic strategy to accelerate growth.
Voicing these feelings, Younus Dagha, Chairman of PRAC, pointed out that high poverty levels, widespread unemployment, a punitive tax regime that increased the tax burden on the salaried class by 230pc, a freeze in investment and capital flight are outcomes of stabilisation policies.
“The critique of stabilisation does highlight the increasingly visible socioeconomic costs of prolonged economic stagnation. There is little doubt that poverty and unemployment have worsened. Tight monetary policy, sharp fiscal contraction and aggressive revenue measures have compressed demand, stalled private investment and eroded household purchasing power. The question is: what choice did the nation have?” discussed a professor of economics who requested anonymity.
“The issue is not stabilisation but lack of growth reforms. Attributing capital flight and investment paralysis solely to stabilisation policies risks oversimplification. Investors are deterred not just by austerity but by persistent structural failures: policy unpredictability, an inequitable tax system, weak contract enforcement, an unreformed energy sector and so on. Stabilisation did not create these problems; it just exposed them,” she said.
“The deeper issue is that adjustment in Pakistan has been extractive rather than reformative. Taxes were raised without broadening the base, and development spending was cut without public-sector restructuring. Energy prices are raised without fixing the power and gas sector losses. The stabilisation period was supposed to provide policymakers with an opportunity to implement politically tough, credible reforms for moving the economy back towards sustainable growth. However, this window is now closing fast. Going forward, the government will face mounting political pressure for rapid economic growth as it approaches the end of its tenure.”
That said, it seems that key government figures realise the impossibility of returning to growth without a strong external sector. Mr Dar also acknowledged at the conference that the external sector remains the economy’s most binding constraint and that repairing it would take time.
Mr Iqbal says Pakistan could potentially achieve 6pc economic growth by 2035, but warns that it would trigger another balance-of-payments crisis within two years unless the economy’s structural weaknesses were addressed and export revenues boosted quickly. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, too, argued that sustainable growth, rather than short-lived expansion, must now be the policy priority. Even Mr Dar clarified that the government had no immediate plan to push growth to 6pc, and that reaching such a level would realistically take two to three years. “We are systematically addressing long-standing inefficiencies,” he said.
Yet, it is increasingly becoming clear that the current “stability” has its own innate contradictions and can hardly be sustained for long as it is achieved by stifling the economy, curbing development spending, restricting imports and accumulating expensive debt.
Three years of stabilisation may have prevented immediate collapse, but it is increasingly undermining its own sustainability by suppressing investment, productivity and exports. A way has to be found to return to growth before this stability turns into another crisis.
With official and private foreign inflows drying up amid stagnating exports, the government policymakers appear clueless as to how to turn the tide. That makes their job of putting the economy on a growth trajectory even more formidable. Political rhetoric sans credible reforms can do only so much.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967727,Suthra Punjab enters ‘correction phase’ - Dawn,"LAHORE: The provincial government’s flagship project – “Suthra Punjab Programme” – has entered its “correction phase” in a bid to resolve the issues identified last year.
The project, according to the government, is the largest cleanliness programme, collecting and disposing of nearly 50,000 tonnes of solid waste on a daily basis in all cities, towns, union councils and villages across Punjab.
“The most important aspect of this mega programme is admitting the issues and gaps we have witnessed in the phase-1 that ended on December 31st, last year. So, 2026 is the year of correction. And we can say that Suthra Punjab programme has entered its correction phase from January 1,” Suthra Punjab Authority’s Director General Babar Sahib Din explains in a talk withDawn.
The Maryam Nawaz-led Punjab government hadlaunchedthe programme in December 2024 after taking over the charge to overcome the lack of a cleanliness mechanism in the districts, except the metropolitan, municipal or urban areas of a few major cities. All other district and tehsil headquarters had a very old system that had almost collapsed.
In villages, union councils and small towns, no cleanliness system ever existed, which meant it was only available to 20 to 30 million people residing in a few major cities, and a majority of the population (around 100m or so) had no such system. This all forced the government to launch the project across the province to collect and dispose of around 50,000 tonnes of solid waste daily, including 35,000 tonnes of garbage that was not being collected and disposed of at all, resulting in serious environmental and health issues.
The DG says the first problem the officers identified was that the number of monitoring officials to supervise cleanliness on major roads was low, which is now being increased in the total 200,000 sq km populated area of Punjab, having 80,000 provincial and district highways.
Similarly, it was also noted that the city areas should have a second shift of sanitary workers, which is being arranged now. Another problem that was identified was the low number of workers in union councils. Last year, each UC had six workers, but the number is being increased to 16 to ensure proper cleanliness. Likewise, the number of equipment will also be increased in UCs.
Previously, the waste management companies existed only in divisional headquarters, which are now being expanded to all district headquarters. “In various districts, the waste management agencies have been set up,” he says.
He says that due to the unavailability of a legal framework, the government has no mechanism to engage local or international companies in its waste-to-energy plans — the first proposed for Lahore to generate 40 to 50MW electricity. In the correction phase, the legal framework is being prepared for the purpose.
To a question, he says the programme’s total human resource strength has reached 150,000 workers and other staffers. Similarly, the number of equipment/machinery has also increased to 30,000 units engaged in collecting and disposing off 45,000 to 50,000 tonnes of solid waste daily.
To another question, the DG says the government’s role will be limited to facilitating the parties interested in participating in the bidding for waste-to-energy projects and providing potential electricity buyers, such as Sundar Industrial Estate, Orange Line project, city’s electric bus system, Knowledge Park, etc.
Sharing details about the role of the private sector, he said the private companies have invested Rs120 billion in the programme by procuring machinery and other resources. The government didn’t spend even a penny on this, as the project is designed on a public-private partnership (PPP) model.
“Previously, the government used to spend Rs45 billion annually for the cleanliness of a few major cities havingpopulations over 20 to 30 million. But now only Rs70 billion are being spent on the total population of 130m in terms of solid waste management by providing subsidy,” he explained.
To another question, he said the entire system, right from human resource to machinery to waste collection and disposal is digitised and being monitored online. According to him, the private companies engaged in the project are developing 150 landfill sites in cities and towns that never existed before.
“We are heading fast towards holding a Guinness World Records event in Lahore, and hopefully this programme will be entered in the Guinness Book of World Records,” he maintained.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968379,SOEs: an eclectic approach - Dawn,"A CONTROVERSY is raging on both mainstream and social media over PIA’s recentprivatisation. Unless this debate is addressed rationally, future privatisation transactions may also be at risk. Past experience offers a cautionary lesson: the Supreme Court’s decision to annul the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills did not revive the enterprise; instead, it led to itsclosurein 2015 and significantly slowed the overall privatisation process.
The popular binary often advanced — either retain enterprises under government ownership or privatise them — is flawed. Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations rather than ideological preferences. Pakistan has 85 commercial SOEs for diverse purposes across power, oil and gas; transport and communications; manufacturing, mining and engineering; finance; industrial estate development and management; and wholesale and retail trade. Of these, 51 are currently profitable. The argument that profitable SOEs should never be divested is as untenable as the view that all 34 lossmaking entities must be privatised. Neither ownership per se nor current financial performance should solely determine policy.
The basic principle for deciding whether an economic activity should be undertaken by the government — through its departments or through an SOE — rests on two questions: a) does the activity fall within the government’s public policy framework? b) Can it be adequately performed by the private sector?
Relevance to public policy framework:The PPF reflects the government’s development priorities, as articulated in documents such as the Principles of Policy (Article 3 of the Constitution) and sectoral policies relating to agriculture, industry, trade, etc. In assessing alignment with the PPF, it is necessary to consider whether an SOE is connected to one or more core state functions — i) ensuring national food security; ii) developing and managing large-scale infrastructure; iii) national defence and security-related activities; iv) entities established through government-to-government or intergovernmental arrangements; and v) provision of goods and services of critical national economic interest. If an SOE falls into any of these categories, there is a prima facie case for retaining it under government control. The decision then is whether it should be retained in its existing form or restructured to improve performance.
Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations.
Market failure considerations:The second question concerns market failure: can the private sector adequately deliver the relevant activity? Each SOE must be evaluated in terms of its operations, functions and market structure, with attention to the following: a) is the SOE a natural monopoly; if so, does an effective regulatory framework exist to ensure socially optimal and cost-effective service delivery under private ownership? b) Does the SOE perform a function that generates significant positive externalities and is, therefore, insufficiently profitable for the private sector to undertake? c) Are there alternative delivery mechanisms to achieve the same objectives?
Where market failure prevents the private sector from maximising social welfare, the government has a strong case for retaining control. Even then, competition can be introduced by dismantling monopolies where feasible and establishing strong, independent regulatory agencies.
Financial viability:While several SOEs report accounting profits, financial viability requires more rigorous assessment. The key question is whether the organisation can generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, meet debt obligations, and, where relevant, finance investment for growth while maintaining acceptable service standards. The financial viability test should be based on the following: a) Negative shareholders’ equity: Any entity with negative equity for the past three years is financially stressed, as its balance sheet is not bankable and it remains dependent on government guarantees or direct budgetary support. b) Continuous losses: Entities incurring losses over the last three years are similarly stressed, as losses either necessitate government support or gradually erode equity. c) Return on assets: While return on equity is a standard metric, ROA is more appropriate when equity is negative. ROA measures how effectively management uses assets to generate earnings. SOEs with an ROA below five per cent for three consecutive years should be considered financially stressed.
In such cases, financial restructuring is the first step. If restructuring fails under government ownership due to extraneous constraints, alternative options — such as outsourcing, leasing, concession agreements, or transfer of managerial control — should be considered. SOEs that don’t meet public policy criteria, don’t address market failure concerns, or cannot be made viable even after restructuring are prime candidates for privatisation, liquidation, or winding up.
Lessons from successful privatisation:Pakistan’s main privatisation success stories are the banking and telecom sectors. In banking, the share of assets held by nationalised commercial banks declined from around 80pc to about 20pc following privatisation. Prior to 2003, the government injected Rs46 billion to recapitalise lossmaking banks; non-performing loans stood at 25pc, and financial soundness indicators were weak. Since privatisation, four major banks (HBL, UBL, MCB, and ABL) have contributed Rs245bn in corporate taxes in 2024 with cumulative contributions exceeding Rs1.6 trillion since 2004. NPLs have fallen below 7pc, provisioning exceeds 100pc, and overall financial soundness has improved.
The main weakness in recent years is the growing role of banks as public sector financiers, reflected in a declining advance-to-deposit ratio. Importantly, public sector banks such as the NBP and the Bank of Punjab have also improved under a competitive market structure and rank among the top 15 Asia-Pacific banks. The ideological argument that these institutions must also be privatised ignores the empirical evidence that ownership itself is not the decisive factor.
PIA’s case:Applying this framework (spelt out in the SOE Triage Report 2021) to PIA leads to a clear conclusion: there were no compelling public policy or market failure reasons for retaining it under government control. The aviation industry is competitive, and private operators have proved their capacity to perform effectively. Despite repeated restructuring efforts, PIA accumulated losses of Rs850bn. The privatisation objective was not short-term maximisation of sale proceeds but elimination of recurring losses and revival of the airline as an efficient enterprise. Over the longer term, improved performance under private management is expected to generate a steady stream of tax revenues rather than drain the exchequer. In sum, Pakistan needs an eclectic, evidence-based approach to SOEs, which transcends ideological divides and focuses squarely on public policy relevance, market structure, and financial viability.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968738,"War in Gaza weakened Arab states, emboldened Israel, says Vali Nasr - Dawn","LAHORE: Iranian-American academic and political scientist Vali Nasr suggested on Friday that the war on Palestine had politically weakened Arab states and emboldened Israeli leaders, to the point that the latter had abandoned the two-state framework entirely.
Speaking at a session titled ‘The Gaza War and the Remaking of the Middle East’, moderated by journalist Najam Sethi, Mr Nasr implied that the situation has proven detrimental to the Palestinian cause.
He said Israel now believes it can pursue its objectives primarily through force. “With Arab states politically neutralised, Israeli leaders see little incentive to return to negotiations,” he added.
According to him, Israeli leadership now views political compromise with the Palestinians as a security liability rather than a pathway to stability, effectively abandoning the two-state framework.
Following the Gaza war, Israelmovedagainst Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakening the group’s operational capacity. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 further altered the regional balance.
Scholar notes Pakistan currently enjoying ‘diplomatic honeymoon’ with Washington, which won’t last for long
Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, long aligned with Iran and regarded as part of the so-called “axis of resistance”, were effectively dismantled.
“With this strategic buffer around Israel gone, Israeli policymakers believed they could confront Iran more directly,” the political scientist said, referring to Israeli-US militarystrikeson Iran in October 2024.
He said Arab states have also seen their influence in regional affairs diminish, leaving them increasingly sidelined. Israel, Mr Nasr argued, has concluded that military strength is now its primary guarantee of security.
As Iran’s regional influence declined, Arab and Muslim countries reassessed Tehran’s strategic importance as a symbol, pillar, and financier of resistance. “Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey moved to restore and strengthen ties with Iran, recognising its symbolic and geopolitical counterweight to Israel,” he said.
Mr Nasr also said the events of Oct 7, 2023 marked a turning point that reshaped regional politics and power dynamics. “In many ways, everything in the Middle East changed on that day,” he said.
Until then, he explained, US strategy in the region centred on normalising Saudi-Israeli relations, expanding the Abraham Accords, building regional trade corridors, and linking Middle Eastern economies with Europe and India while bypassing China.
“The events of October 7 pushed the Palestinian issue, which the US and many regional allies had put on the back burner, back to the centre of global attention,” Mr Nasr said, adding that Israel’s security doctrine has since undergone a fundamental shift.
He also criticised the “Board of Peace” initiative announced by US President Donald Trump, calling it ineffective because it excludes Palestinians. According to Mr Nasr, several participating countries joined mainly to maintain favourable relations with Trump rather than to advance a genuine peace process.
Despite the shifting landscape, the political scientist said key questions remain unresolved.
“The future of Gaza is still unclear. There are also uncertainties surrounding the role of a potential Pakistan-Saudi defence partnership and how Iran and Turkey will manage their competing interests in Syria,” he said.
However, he concluded that the regional balance of power has already undergone a historic shift. “The Middle East has entered a new phase, and this transformation may well be permanent,” he said.
‘Diplomatic honeymoon’
In a separate discussion, titled ‘Pakistan: Between the USA and China’, Mr Nasr argued against the view that China’s rise is irreversible and America’s decline is inevitable, advising middle powers such as Pakistan to focus on strengthening their own technological and economic foundations.
Sharing the stage with former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and journalist Raza Rumi, Mr Nasr described Pakistan’s current relationship with Washington as a diplomatic “honeymoon”, which had so far helped shield Islamabad from difficult questions regarding its strategic ties with China and its defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia.
“This relationship has also helped Pakistan avoid scrutiny over its conflict with India, largely because it played its diplomatic cards well,” he said.
Noting that Pakistan had also benefited from the recent strain in US-India ties, Mr Nasr cautioned that this favourable phase may not last long.
“The United States effectively has two centres of power — one represented by the White House and the other by permanent institutions such as the State Department and the Pentagon,” he said.
“Pakistan is currently engaging mainly with the White House and benefiting from it, but the institutional system is likely to reassert itself and reopen uncomfortable discussions.”
Ms Khar largely agreed with Nasr’s assessment, and called for Pakistan to deepen its alignment with China — which she described as more predictable and consistent in its diplomacy — while maintaining constructive relations with the United States.
“The US remains a global superpower and Pakistan must remain on the right side of Washington,” she said, but warned policymakers not to assume that this situation would last.

LAHORE: The Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has imposed a ban on kite flying in public parks and greenbelts on Basant, as the Lahore administration decided to digitally monitor the three-day festival,startingFeb 6, to ensure compliance.
PHA Managing Director Raja Mansoor Ahmad said the decision was made to ensure that kite flying and related celebrations did not harm trees and other park infrastructure.
“Since the Basant festival is being held for three days in Lahore alone, the arrival of a number of people from other cities of Punjab, other provinces and abroad is expected here for kite flying and other related activities.
In such a situation, the people may rush for the public parks and green areas for kite flying and other related celebrations…” he toldDawn.
He said the decision was made to prevent any untoward incident, including damage to the plants, greenbelts and other infrastructure.
“Lahore, in addition to its huge number of permanent residents, may also have a considerable number of people from other cities and countries starting from the Feb 4 evening, since Feb 5 is also a public holiday (Youm-i-Kashmir),” he added.
“The parks would remain open to the people, but they wouldn’t be allowed for kite flying,” he said, adding that the PHA enforcement staff has been put on high alert.
According to an official notification by the PHA, the directors concerned have been asked to ensure strict implementation of the ban within their respective zones.
The authority emphasised that any violation of these instructions will be considered unacceptable, and in case of any damage or untoward incident, the respective director would be held responsible.
Digital monitoring
Meanwhile, the city district administration said that strict digital monitoring of Basant would be carried out through drone cameras and the Lahore Safe City Authority’s cameras. A control room would be set up at the DC office.
It was revealed in a meeting presided over by Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali Ijaz.
“Kite flying will only be allowed from Feb 6 to 8, whereas the material will be sold through registered dealers alone,” the DC said while speaking on the occasion.
He said that kites bigger than the ap­­pro­ved sizes will be prohibited. More­over, none of the bikers would be allowed to drive without safety wires. Basant would only be allowed at specific grounds or no­­tified rooftops, including in the Walled City or other locations across the district.
On the other hand, as many as 2,437 kite manufacturers, sellers, traders and associations have applied for registration with the city administration for the festival.
According to a document seen byDawn, as many as 1,334 kite sellers applied for registration till Jan 22, 2026. Out of this, 161 applications were currently in process, whereas 1,107 had been approved.
A total of 838 kite manufacturers applied for registration, 697 applications had been approved, whereas 85 were in process. However, 51 applications were rejected.
Similarly, 250 kite traders applied for registration, out of which 19 applications were in process and 223 had been appro­ved. Eight applications were rejected.
Moreover, 18 kite flying associations applied for registration, of which 12 were approved, two are in process, while four applications were rejected.
It is pertinent to mention that the provincial government decided in December last year to celebrate a limited Basant in Lahore with strict conditions.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1964668,Quetta’s water crisis worsens as groundwater depletes and public supply fails - Dawn,"For more than three decades, Muhammad Jahangir Khan has lived on Jamiat Rai Street off Spinny Road, a settled neighbourhood in Quetta with the basic markers of an urban locality. The area has gas and electricity connections, and most streets are paved. Yet in 2026, his house has still never been connected to a water pipeline.
Like many of his neighbours, Jahangir plans his household routine around the arrival of a private water tanker, an expense that was once considered temporary but has long become permanent. What was once seen as an exception has quietly become the norm, as the experience is no longer confined to informal settlements.
Across Quetta, even residents of established urban localities are surviving without a regular public water supply. Instead, they are relying on private arrangements rather than a functioning municipal system.
To top it all off, unregulated use of tube wells, many of them illegally installed, has significantly worsened Quetta’s water crisis. Excessive pumping to compensate for weak public supply has rapidly depleted groundwater reserves, with extraction far exceeding natural recharge in the arid region.
Behind people’s daily struggles lies a deeper structural crisis rooted in geography, climate and policy failure. Despite covering nearly 44 per cent of Pakistan’s landmass, Balochistan receives less than 200mm of annual rainfall, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. Data from the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) shows that agriculture depends on groundwater for over 90 per cent of its needs, while only five per cent of farmland is connected to canal irrigation.
In Quetta, groundwater levels are falling by two to five metres annually, driven by unchecked extraction, including more than 30,000 illegal tube wells, per the Balochistan Agriculture Department. Moreover, a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) shows that the water table has dropped from about 50 metres in 2,000 to over 150 metres by 2023, posing a serious threat to agriculture and livelihoods.
InSeptember last year, Commissioner of Quetta Division Shahzaib Khan Kakar and Deputy Commissioner of Quetta Captain (Retd) Mehrullah Badini warned that the water shortage in the provincial capital was worsening with each passing day, urging joint action by the government and citizens. “We are going to announce a water emergency in Quetta,” they cautioned.
For residents, the problem is neither new nor unheard of. Jahangir said people living on his street have repeatedly submitted applications to elected representatives for pipeline installation, but their complaints were ignored, and no action was taken.
Fareed Bugti, a social activist living in the Nawa Kili Teachers Colony of Quetta, toldDawnthat his neighbourhood is also deprived of basic facilities.
“The Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa) installed a water pipeline in my area 10 years ago, but supply from these pipelines has not been restored to date,” Bugti said.
According to Bugti, the population of Nawa Kili has exceeded 200,000, yet the area relies on just two government-owned tube wells, which serve only Mandokhelabad and Pashtunistan Chowk.
“Citizens have installed hundreds of tube wells themselves without obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the local administration, due to which the groundwater level is decreasing day by day,“ he said. “And areas where there are no tube wells, people are forced to depend entirely on private tankers.”
Even where water is supplied, it is irregular. In some localities, residents receive water only once a day for a few hours, while others get a supply once a week.
While some areas have seen limited intervention, relief remains uneven and fragile. Shahryar Kasi, a resident of Shaldara on Kasi Road, said water shortages in the area were once severe. “Wasa used to supply water after a week or 10 days, and even that would stop within minutes,” he said.
He added that during the tenure of the previous government, a tube well was installed on Kasi Road, easing shortages in the surrounding areas. “Now we get water once a day, which has provided clear relief,” he added.
The situation, however, has not improved uniformly throughout the city, with many areas receiving water only once a week.
Khair Muhammad Dehwar, a resident of Kalat Street in the Jail Road area, said water supply deteriorated after Balochistan faced a prolonged drought from 1998 to 2006.
“Some tube wells installed by the government were damaged, but they never got repaired,” he said, adding that Wasa later refused to take over certain wells, citing insufficient groundwater.
“Wasa provides water once a week for half an hour or an hour, but due to low pressure, it does not reach houses at the end of the streets,” Dehwar said. “As a result, about 60 per cent of households have to order private tankers.”
In Pashtunabad, resident Rehmatullah Durrani said water is supplied for about an hour a day through a tube well installed at a school. “If it develops a fault and is not repaired, residents are forced to call tankers,” he said.
In several neighbourhoods, even state-led interventions have failed to deliver equitable access. Umair Parkani, a resident of Killi Bangulzai in Quetta Saryab district, said his neighbourhood has relied on private tankers for years despite elected representatives from his area making repeated promises.
A tube well installed during the previous government failed to supply water to the entire area due to insufficient groundwater. Although two damaged tube wells were later repaired, Parkani said water still does not reach his house. “It reaches only a few nearby streets. People living farther away still have no option but tankers.”
Others have to keep paying the water bill despite their houses being largely deprived of water.
Mansoor Ahmed, a retired banker living in the Smungli Housing Scheme of the Quetta Development Authority (QDA), said he spends thousands of rupees monthly to purchase water from tankers. Like others, he too has a water supply connection in his house, but receives water for just less than an hour on alternate days. Yet, he has to pay for the whole month.
“Even then, I keep paying the water bill for a full month,” Ahmed toldDawn, adding that the situation gets even worse during the summer months.
“People living in the area have no other option but to purchase water from the private tanker mafia,” he lamented.
Concern has also reached the judiciary. On October 15, the Balochistan High Court (BHC)expressedstrong disappointment over the severe shortage of drinking water in Hazara Town and surrounding areas, terming the deprivation of such a basic necessity a “serious act of administrative negligence.”
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Gul Hassan Tareen heard a petition, ordering immediate action from Wasa, the Public Health Engineering Department (PHE) and Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco). The court observed that residents were facing extreme difficulties due to poor inter-departmental coordination and funding delays.
Residents of Hazara Town, appearing before the court, claimed that a private water supply mafia was illegally selling water through Wasa pipelines. They claimed that citizens were being charged Rs30,000-40,000 for illegal connections and monthly fees of Rs2,500-3,000.
The court ordered the cancellation of illegal contracts and directed authorities to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply to operational tube wells.
Despite the court’s orders, citizens said the situation could hardly improve.
Experts say the crisis reflects long-standing failures in planning and regulation. Dr Munir Ahmed Babar, Professor at US-Pakistan Centre for Advanced Studies in Water (USPCAS-W) at Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, toldDawnthat Quetta’s continued reliance on tube wells was fundamentally unsustainable.
“Quetta depends almost completely on groundwater, and that groundwater is going down by around one to 1.5 meters every year,“ he said. “This means that more water is being pumped out than nature can refill, while continuing to install tube wells — even solar-powered ones — is not sustainable.”
Dr Babar compared groundwater to a bank account. “Quetta keeps withdrawing without making deposits,“ he said, adding that with very low rainfall and almost no natural recharge, this approach will lead to dry wells, land subsidence, agricultural collapse and worsening drinking water shortages.
“Sustainability is only possible if new tube wells are restricted or banned, illegal wells sealed, groundwater pumping is measured and priced, recharge dams are built, and rainwater harvesting is introduced.
“Without regulation and recharge, Quetta is moving towards water exhaustion,“ he said.
Speaking about why alternative long-term water sources were not developed in the city earlier, he said, “Quetta did not fail because solutions were unknown. It failed because of weak governance, lack of long-term planning, political interests, and dependence on groundwater, because it was cheap and easy,“ he said.
He added that urgent regulatory steps are needed to protect groundwater and ensure fair access. “Every tube well must be registered and metered, tanker businesses regulated, illegal extraction criminalised and recharge infrastructure prioritised. Quetta’s water crisis is man-made, and only governance reform combined with conservation and recharge can reverse it.”
Wasa Managing Director Mujeebur Rehman Kakar said the authority supplies water to just 51 per cent of Quetta’s population, which makes about 1.275 million people.
“We have 544 tube wells, of which 387 are functional,” he toldDawn, adding that around 1,000 may be unauthorised.
He cited arid climate, low rainfall, poor geology, droughts, rapid urbanisation and weak monitoring as major contributors to the crisis.
PHE Secretary Muhammad Hashim Ghilzai said Quetta requires 60 million gallons per day but receives only 31.575 million gallons.
He added that the Mangi Dam project, expected to be completed in March 2026, would initially supply 8.1 million gallons daily.
As pressure mounts to move beyond short-term fixes, officials say resolving Quetta’s water crisis will require sustained political will, strict enforcement and long-term planning rather than ad hoc measures.
Deputy Commissioner Quetta Captain (Retd) Badini said resolving the crisis would require sustained effort, expert input and strict enforcement.
“We are keeping an eye on the installation of illegal tube-wells,” Badini said, adding that the use of potable water for car-washing at homes and workshops had also been banned. He said efforts were underway to supply treated wastewater for irrigation, plantations and roadside trees.
“No one uses fresh water for irrigation, providing water for roadside trees and for lawns in the houses,” he said, adding that a drip system had been adopted for roadside plantations. He pointed to countries that avoid using groundwater, relying instead on rain, snowfall, rivers, lakes and dams to preserve underground reserves for future generations.
Badini stressed the urgent need to raise awareness among farmers and other segments of society about conserving groundwater. “We have left nothing underground for the next generation,” he said, noting how unrestricted solar-powered pumping had accelerated depletion.
The president of the Quetta Press Club, Irfan Saeed, also expressed serious concern over the crisis, questioning what future generations would inherit. Recalling his childhood, he said groundwater was once available at depths of just 15 to 20 feet and rose to 10 feet after rainfall.
“Water is life, and we are rapidly depriving it,” he said, urging the construction of dams to store rain and floodwater for future use.

According to a post by the Foreign Office on X, Mr Dar and Mr Araghchi spoke on the phone, during which the two diplomats discussed the current situation in Iran and the wider region.
Mr Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister, “expressed hope for peace and stability, and both sides agreed to continue bilateral consultations on matters of mutual interest”, the statement added.
On Thursday, Pakistan had expressed hope at the United Nations Security Council for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, which saw its largest demonstrations in years, challenging the country’s government.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds.
Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions.
US President Donald Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters. However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country.
Meanwhile, on the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in the neighbouring country were directly linked to Islamabad’s own interests.
He also said that Pakistan was engaging with US on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968228,Japan restarts world’s biggest nuclear plant 15 years after Fukushima disaster - Dawn,"The world’s biggest nuclear power plant was restarted on Wednesday for the first time since the2011 Fukushima disaster, its Japanese operator said, despite persistent safety concerns among residents.
The plant was “started at 19:02”, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) spokesman Tatsuya Matoba toldAFPof the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata prefecture.
The regional governor approved the resumption last month, although public opinion remains sharply divided.
On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters — mostly elderly — braved freezing temperatures to demonstrate in the snow near the plant’s entrance, whose buildings line the Sea of Japan coast.
“It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, toldAFP.
Around 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September.
TEPCO said on Wednesday it would “proceed with careful verification of each plant facility’s integrity” and address any issues appropriately and transparently.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.
The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.
However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.
Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source.
Fourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.
Nearly 15 years after the disaster, “the situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that’s absolutely unacceptable”, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator.
The vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades.
However, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate.
“I think it’s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,” Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, toldAFP.
On January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority.
The petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.
“We can’t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,” it said.
“Making many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo … is intolerable.” Before the 2011 disaster — which killed around 18,000 people — nuclear power generated about a third of Japan’s electricity.
Japan’s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks.
At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test.
“Safety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,” TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with theAsahidaily newspaper.
Japan is the world’s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.
Nearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil — a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power.
Under a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan’s energy supply by 2040 — up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24.
Meanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:45:21 GMT",,power generation Pakistan,Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968436,Japan suspends restart of world’s biggest nuclear plant - Dawn,"Therestartof the world’s largest nuclear power plant was suspended in Japan on Thursday, with the operator saying it does not know when the problem would be solved.
The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata province had been closed since the2011 Fukushima disaster, but operations to relaunch it had begun on Wednesday after it received the final green light from the nuclear regulator.
However, its operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), said on Thursday that “an alarm from the monitoring system sounded during the reactor startup procedures”, causing it to suspend operations.
“We don’t expect this to be solved within a day or two. There is no telling at the moment how long it will take,” site superintendent Takeyuki Inagaki told a news conference.
“We will for now fully focus on trying to identify the cause of what happened,” he said.
The alarm that went off prompted TEPCO to “investigate the malfunctioning electrical equipment,” spokesman Takashi Kobayashi toldAFP.
And “once it became clear that it would take time, we decided to reinsert the control rods in a planned manner”, he said, adding that the reactor “is stable and there is no radioactive impact outside”.
Control rods are a device used to control the nuclear chain reaction in the reactor core, which can be accelerated by slightly withdrawing them, or slowed down or stopped completely by inserting them deeper.
The restart, initially scheduled for Tuesday, had been pushed back after another technical issue related to the rods’ removal was detected last weekend — a problem that was resolved on Sunday, according to TEPCO.

Addressing a news conference, Mr Khan said that macroeconomic stability has largely been achieved and that the government’s focus was now on promoting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
He emphasised that MSMEs are the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, playing a critical role in employment generation, production, and exports.
“The government has placed MSMEs at the centre of national development, with a clear priority to ensure that economic policies reach every district and every small business across the country,” the special assistant said.

He highlighted that the capital value of an SME ranges between Rs30 million and Rs150m, but the core strength of our economy is with the micro enterprises, and we need to mainstream them.”
He highlighted that the main issues faced by MSMEs were a lack of access to financing, as banks do not provide loans to this segment, and a lack of information on marketing their products.
He said that the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (Smeda) has been reorganised and its new head has been appointed.
The special assistant added that consultations with SME clusters nationwide have been completed, and a comprehensive SME policy has been formulated with representation from all provinces and regions.
The SAPM announced that the “Made in Pakistan SME Cluster Showcase Expo 2026” will be held from Jan 24 to 26 at the Expo Centre Lahore.
He described the event as Pakistan’s national platform for small businesses, featuring over 30 SME cluster pavilions and participation from 174 representatives.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967976,PSX hits new peak despite economic concerns - Dawn,"KARACHI: Despite signs of economic fragility, including a current account deficit and a sharp plunge in foreign direct investment in December 2025, equity investors continued their buying spree, propelling the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) to a fresh all-time closing high near the 188,000-point mark on Monday amid strong expectations of another policy rate cut.
According to Topline Securities Ltd, bulls remained firmly in control throughout the session, driving the benchmark index to an intraday high of 2,783 points before it settled at 187,761, up 2,662 points or 1.44pc.
Market sentiment rem­ained buoyant amid growing expectations of an imminent interest rate cut, with participants increasingly pricing in a 50-basis-point reduction at the forthcoming monetary policy meeting on Jan 26. This outlook sustained broad-based buying across sectors.
Select stocks, including Nishat Mills Ltd, Adamjee Insurance Company Ltd, IGI Holdings Ltd and Lucky Cement, attracted notable investor interest. On the index front, Engro Holdings, United Bank, Hub Power, Fauji Fertiliser, Meezan Bank and Service Industries emerged as the top contributors, together adding 1,554 points.
Ali Najib, deputy head of trading at Arif Habib Ltd, said the PSX extended its bullish momentum across the board, supported by upbeat sentiment, better-than-expected corporate results, and rising expectations of a policy rate cut. He added that recent Treasury bill and Pakistan Investment Bond auctions had reinforced signals of further monetary easing.
On the corporate front, hydrocarbons were discovered in the Tal Block, with expected gas production of 1.37 million cubic feet per day. MOL operates the block with a 10pc stake, while Pakistan Petroleum and OGDC each hold 30pc, Pakistan Oilfields owns 25pc, and Government Holdings (Pvt) Ltd retains 5pc.
On the macroeconomic side, Pakistan recorded a current account deficit of $244 million in December 2025, compared to surpluses of $454m in December 2024 and $98m in November 2025. During the first half of FY26, the current account posted a deficit of $1.174 billion, compared with a surplus of $957 million in the same period last year. The country also witnessed a net FDI outflow of $135m in December.
Trading activity rose 24.92pc to 1.19bn shares, although traded value dec­lined 8.15pc to Rs63.8bn. Bank Makramah Ltd led the volume chart with 247m shares.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967797,Govt admits ‘thousands of deaths’ as Iran begins to restore internet - Dawn,"PARIS: Acknowledging thousands of deaths in the recent protests that swept the country, Iran’s supreme leader blamed the United States and Israel for organising the deadly violence.
“At least 5,000 people have been killed, including about 500 security personnel,” an Iranian officiail said, as authorities ordered gradual restoration of internet access after a 10-day shutdown aimed at quelling riots.
Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years.
Officials said the protests were peaceful until foreign influence turned them violent.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if protesters continued to be killed on the streets or were executed. In a social media post on Friday, he thanked Tehran’s leaders, saying they had called off scheduled mass executions.
Official puts death toll around 5,000; judiciary announces executions will go ahead
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, made it cler that local or international criminals would be punished. “We will not drag the country into war, but we will not let domestic or international criminals go unpunished,” Ira­n’s state media quoted him as saying.
On Sunday, the judiciary indicated that executions may go ahead.
“A series of actions have been identified as Mohareb, which is among the most severe Islamic punishments,” Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir told a presser.
Mohareb, an Islamic legal term meaning to wage war against God, is punishable by death under Iranian law.
In an interview with Politico on Saturday, Trump said, “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran”.
The Iranian official in the region said the verified death toll was unlikely to get much higher.
“The final toll is not expected to increase sharply,” the official said, adding that “Israel and armed groups abroad” had supported and equipped those taking to the streets.
The Iranian government regularly blames unrest on foreign enemies, including the United States and Israel - an arch foe of the Islamic Republic which launched military strikes on Iran in June.
Highest death toll in Kurdish areas
The Iranian official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, claimed some of the heaviest clashes and highest number of deaths were in the Iranian Kurdish areas in the country’s northwest. Kurdish separatists have been active in those areas and flare-ups there have been among the most violent in past periods of unrest.
Some sources said that armed Kurdish separatist groups sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq in a sign of foreign entities potentially seeking to take advantage of instability in the country.
The Norway-based Iranian Kurdish rights group Hengaw said some of the heaviest clashes during protests that erupted in late December were in Kurdish areas in the northwest.
Meanwhile, Iranian authorities said internet access was being gradually restored.
Some internet access has been restored in Iran, a monitor said on Sunday. “Traffic data indicate a significant return to some online services including Google, suggesting that heavily filtered access has been enabled, corroborating user reports of partial restoration,” Netblocks said in a social media post.
The Tasnim news agency earlier reported “the relevant authorities announced that internet access would be gradually restored”, but gave no further details.
On Sunday morning, some foreign news agencies were able to connect to the internet from its Tehran office, though the vast majority of internet providers and mobile internet remain cut. Outgoing international calls have been possible since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored on Saturday morning.

Speaking at the oath-taking ceremony of newly-elected members of the party in Serai Naurang town here on Sunday, he said that both the countries should join hands to promote lasting peace in the region.
“The unity and consensus between Islamabad and Kabul will also pave the way for freedom of Kashmir and Palestine,” he maintained.
JI district emir Mufti Irfanullah, secretary general Maulana Shamsul Arif and member provincial Majlis-i-Shura Abdul Samad Khan were also present on the occasion.
Mr Ibrahim asked Afghanistan not to fall into the misconception of considering India as its friend.
“India can never be a sincere friend of Afghanistan as past experiences are enough to prove that Afghanistan has suffered as a result of friendship with India,” he added, saying that India’s ill-intention to use other countries for its interests is the main reason for instability in the region.
He expressed serious concern over the activities of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and said that the subversive actions by TTP elements were the main cause of tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
He asked the TTP elements to abandon the path of violence and return to Afghanistan because their current activities were in no way in the interest of Islam, the region and people.
Referring to the recent statement of the prime minister of Pakistan, he said that the premier had taken a strong stand against terrorism. “The nation stands with the prime minister to eliminate terrorism from the country,” he remarked.
He urged the government to formulate an independent, sovereign foreign policy free from American influence and based on its own decisions.
“The war against terrorism cannot be won with the support of America. If the government announces the enforcement of an Islamic system in the country, all problems will come to an end,” he remarked.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967806/search-begins-after-fire-kills-six-reduces-shops-to-ashes-in-karachi,"Search begins after fire kills six, reduces shops to ashes in Karachi - Dawn","KARACHI: The death toll from the blaze at Gul Plaza on Karachi’s M.A. Jinnah Road rose to six on Sunday, with three more people, including a firefighter, losing their lives, while 26 others were injured and 59 were still missing, officials said.
Authorities said the fire, which erupted on Saturday night, was almost contained after 24-hour-long efforts. A search operation was underway amid fears of further casualties at the time of going to press.
Officials initially suspected an electrical short-circuit, but said the cause was yet to be confirmed.
The fire spread rapidly, fuelled by combustible mat­erial stored in around 1,200 shops in the ground-plus-three-storey building, spr­ead over 8,000 square yards.
On Sunday, hundreds of people had gathered aro­und the building, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.
Parts of the building collapsed during the firefighting operation. Tra­ders’ bodies estimated financial losses of up to Rs25 billion and claiming that 5,000 people worked in the shops.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the fire and fix responsibility.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that six men, aged in their 20s and 30s, were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. Post-mortem examinations were conducted and the cause of death was declared inhalation injuries and burns, she said.
Moreover, 26 men, aged 18 to 45, were brought for treatment, with 11 suffering burn injuries, she said, adding that all were discharged after first aid as none of them had suffered critical injuries.
She said “mass disaster protocols” had been activated at hospitals after officials provided a list of missing persons, including women and children, and warned that the death toll could rise.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hass­a­anul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that they received the initial call at around 1:38am on Sunday. He said rescuers were first told the fire started in a shop dealing in artificial flowers on the ground floor before spreading to the basement and upper levels.
He said the building housed shops containing clothing, plastic goods, suitcases and chemicals used for perfumes and cosmetics, while the top level had a roof and parking area.
Rescue teams, including those from Rescue 1122, the Karachi Met­ropolitan Corporation fire brigade, Pakistan Navy and the Karachi Port Trust, rescued around 50 people safely on Saturday-Sunday night, he said.
Another 20 people were rescued in injured condition, but three later died. Mr Khan said two bodies were recovered from debris late on Sunday night, while a 25-year-old firefighter, Furqan Ali, lost his life when part of the building collapsed and debris fell on him.
He said the intensity of the blaze had weakened the pillars, and the rear portion of the building had already collapsed, with the remaining half of the structure at risk.
Quoting Sindh Building Control Authority officials, he said the building was constructed in the 1990s and an additional floor was added in 2003.
59 missing; Rs25bn losses
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police had a list of 59 missing persons. “So far, we have shortlisted seven of them based on their call details,” he said, adding that their phones were last traced to the plaza before being switched off.
Sindh Chief Minister Shah, Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, IGP Javed Alam Odho and other senior officials visited the site and reviewed the rescue operation.
Meanwhile, All City Tajir Ittehad, an alliance of traders’ bodies, said in a statement that its representatives estimated losses of Rs20bn to Rs25bn, including the value of goods and reconstruction costs.
“This is not only the destruction of a building but a source of livelihood for thousands,” it said, insisting that over 5,000 people worked in more than 1,200 shops.
President, PM grieve
President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday expressed sorrow over the death of firefighter Furqan Ali, praising his bravery and offering condolences to the bereaved family, according to a statement from the President’s Secretariat. He stressed that fire safety and emergency res­p­onse systems should be strengthened to prevent such tragedies in the future.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the loss of life and directed authorities to take all possible steps to protect lives and property. “The affected traders and other victims would be provided with every possible assistance,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also spoke to the Sindh chief minister by phone to express sorrow over the loss of lives and offered the Centre’s full support to the provincial government.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967632,Relief as US puts off strikes - Dawn,"WHILE the US may want regime change in Iran, and Israel the collapse of the established order, internal strife and chaos, it appears that Tehran hasstayed safe from US-led military strikes, for the time being at least, because any such action seems less imminent now than it did earlier this week.
Speculation abounds about what made US President Donald Trump change his mind — from entreaties by Gulf friends, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, to a seemingly bizarreNew York Timesreportthat claimed that the apartheid state’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also asked the US leader not to launch military strikes for the time being.
However, in Trump’s own words “nobody” made him change his mind and it was the staying of 800 hangings of protesters that Iran had supposedly planned that was the main reason he had called off the strikes and also because the protesters’ “killing has stopped”.
Whatever led to the pause, temporary or permanent, it is a welcome development for the region, which seemed to be sliding towards strife, with worries in the Gulf about Iran’s possible retaliatory missile strikes against American military bases and, who knows, even economic infrastructure such as oil and gas facilities.
Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders.
Perhaps, the most serious challenges would have come Pakistan’s way in either a regime change or collapse-chaos scenario. In the case of regime cha­­­nge, it would not have been surprising to see an administration in Tehran sympathetic to Isra­­el. That would have meant a hostile entity like Israeli intelligence enjoying far greater access to Iran than, for example, Indian intelligence has at present.
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are like a sty in Israel’s eye. And, therefore, you can well imagine the consequences of the latter’s intelligence sitting on our nearly 1,000-kilometre border with Iran, adding to our existing security concerns due to the situation on the Indian and Afghan borders. Coastal security would be another concern.
In the other scenario, where a central authority collapse would lead to chaos and fragmentation, it would be reasonable to assume that Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province would be one of the regions affected by any such development, which, in turn, would lead to even more issues across our common, often porous, border.
With the same ethnicity straddling the border, you can well imagine the boost the insurgency in our Balochistan could get from the collapse of the central authority in Iran. Israel has enhanced its security through internal strife in Syria. It is the Mossad playbook for all states around it who are not in its pocket.
So, Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders and up the coast, in the short run at least. But Trump’sdecision to impose another 25 per cent tariffon anyone doing business with Iran will deepen the crisis in the sanctions-clamped nation.
It was the economic crisis, with the rapidly falling value of the Iranian currency and inflation, that triggered the recent round of street protests. There can be no doubt that the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was involved in arming and instigating some of the protesters as the former CIA chief and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo openly tweeted, but the protests erupted due to the economic mess where even purchasing bread is becoming a problem.
This fact was acknowledged by Iran’s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who said the government needed to address the legitimate concerns of the protesters who had a right to take to the streets. Now a new budget is expected to be presented before parliament to replace the earlier proposal rejected by it. But then, the protests turned violent and the security services were ordered to crack down.
Some Tehran-based sources say the protests were peaceful till some elements from among the protesters fired at the security forces and also attacked infrastructure. These sources claimed that, of the 2,000 people killed, some 700 were law-enforcement officers. But these claims were impossible to verify independently.
Trump’s tariffs on top of sanctions could create further problems for the Iranian leadership as even the thus far recalcitrant India is having second thoughts about doing business with Iran and haspulled out of the Chabahar port project, which it saw as vital to expanding its trade ties all the way to Central Asia.
With the exception of China and Russia, additional US tariffs would be sufficient to discourage the smaller economies from trading with Iran, which would worsen the resource crunch in that country. The oppressive Iranian regime has some serious thinking to do over the coming weeks.
The immediate threat of US-Israeli military action may have receded somewhat but the economic crisis is going to worsen. Iran may consider easing restrictions on how women should be attired and create more space for peaceful expression of dissent as a means of reducing tensions within its society.
Side by side, it should consider what price tag it wants to attach to its nuclear programme. With its successful and lethal missile programme, it has already gained a degree of effective defence. Only Iran can tell if stopping its enrichment programme in exchange for lifting of sanctions and economic relief is worthwhile.
If its missile stockpile, particularly of the hypersonic variant, is what prompted many of its Gulf neighbours and, by some accounts, even Israel, to ask the US not to provoke it by attacking, Iran’s defence shield seems to be working. Only the decision-makers in Tehran will know if that is enough or whether their pursuit of nuclear weapons is non-negotiable.
Their past experience of doing a deal with the Obama administration in 2015 to cap enrichment that Trump later annulled is not encouraging. Even then, it’s not clear what other options a country facing economic ruin and internal strife can exercise.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967769,Fiorentina honour deceased Commisso with crucial victory at Bologna - Dawn,"MILAN: Fiorentina honoured deceased owner Rocco Commisso with Sunday’s 2-1 win at off-form Bologna which boosted their Serie A survival bid.
Without a win until just before Christmas, Fioren­tina claimed a deserved third success in six matches thanks to goals in the first half from Rolando Mandr­agora and Roberto Piccoli.
Paolo Vanoli’s side sit just inside the relegation zone but level on 17 points with Lecce, who are 17th and face AC Milan.
Fiorentina have a superior goal difference than Lecce and only sit below them by virtue of having played a game more.
That means a defeat for Lecce at the San Siro against title-chasing Milan would push Fiorentina, who less than a month ago looked destined for the drop, out of the bottom three.
Sunday’s win was a fine way to pay tribute to American media mogul Commisso, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 76 and was remembered with a minute’s silence ahead of kick-off.
During pre-match preparations, Fiorentina players wore T-shirts with a picture of Commisso and the message  “Thanks Rocco”, in tribute to a man who just missed out on giving the Tuscan club a first major trophy since 2001.
In Saturday’s late match, Juventus’ Serie A title ambitions are all  but over after they suffered a 1-0 defeat at Cagliari, in a  game where the visitors were unable to make their domination of  possession count.
Juventus sit fifth in  the standings on 39 points, 10 behind leaders Inter Milan, who beat  Udinese 1-0 on Saturday. Cagliari are 15th on 22 points, the win taking  them eight points away from the relegation zone.
Cagliari failed to  register a shot attempt in the opening half but scored a shock winner  when Luca Mazzitelli scored with 25 minutes remaining to end Juve’s  six-match unbeaten league run.
“You tip your hat to your opponents, who brought home a victory  that perhaps they didn’t deserve, but sniffed out the opportunity and  took it,” Juventus manager Luciano Spalletti told Sky Sport. “Maybe next time we can learn from that and sniff out our chance too.”
Earlier on Saturday, champions Napoli ended a run of three consecutive draws by beating  Sassuolo 1-0 at home to get their bid to retain the Serie A  title back on track.
Stanislav Lobotka scored the only goal of the game but the win came at a cost for injury-hit Napoli as defender Amir Rrahmani  and forward Matteo Politano both picked up knocks, with coach Antonio  Conte already missing Romelu Lukaku, Kevin De Bruyne, Andre Anguissa and  David Neres.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967961/italian-designer-valentino-dies-at-93,Italian designer Valentino dies at 93 - Dawn,"
ROME: A mix of carmine and scarlet, with a hint of orange — a new hue, inspired by an elderly woman at Barcelona’s opera house, whose elegance struck a young Valentino Garavani.
The colour, introduced to the fashion world several years later, in 1959, with a strapless cocktail dress of draped tulle, has carried his name — “Valentino red” — ever since, doubling as the eponymous Italian fashion group’s signature.
“I think a woman dressed in red is always wonderful, she is the perfect image of a heroine,” Valentino wrote in the book Rosso (Red), released in 2022. He would include at least one red dress in every one of his collections. Valentino, one of Italy’s leading fashion designers, died on Monday at his Roman residence, his foundation announced. He was 93 years old. The cause of death was not immediately known.
Valentino ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld as the last of a leading generation of designers, from an era before fashion became a highly commercial industry run as much by financiers and marketing executives as by couturiers.
Scaling the heights of high fashion, he was the first Italian to feature on the exclusive Paris haute couture catwalks.
Passionate about film, he dreamed as a young man of dressing the  “beautiful ladies of the silverscreen”, as he called them, among them 1950s Hollywood stars Lana Turner and Judy Garland. Valentino would eventually design Elizabeth Taylor’s wedding gown, and was the first choice for numerous Oscar winners, including Sharon Stone and Penelope Cruz.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967965/40-killed-after-two-high-speed-trains-collide-in-spain,40 killed after two high-speed trains collide in Spain - Dawn,"ADAMUZ: At least 40 people died in southern Spain after a high-speed train derailed and collided with an oncoming one on Sunday night in one of the worst railway accidents in Europe in the past 80 years.
Twelve were in intensive care after the accident near Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, about 360 km (223 miles) south of Madrid, according to emergency services. Experts studying the crash site say a faulty rail joint may be key to determining the cause of the crash.
“The train tipped to one side... then everything went dark, and all I heard was screams,” said Ana Garcia Aranda, 26, who was travelling back to Madrid and was being treated at a Red Cross centre in Adamuz. Limping and wrapped in a blanket, her face covered with plasters, she described how fellow passengers dragged her out of the train covered in blood.
Firefighters rescued her pregnant sister from the wreckage and an ambulance took them both to hospital.
There were people who were fine and others who were very, very badly injured. You had them right in front of you and you knew they were going to die, and you couldn’t do anything, she said.
The collision occurred in a hilly, olive-growing region which could only be accessed by a single-track road, making it difficult for ambulances to enter and exit, Iigo Vila, national emergency director at the Spanish Red Cross, said.
Emergency teams were struggling to bring in heavy machinery that could lift the wreckage to get access to more of the dead, the Andalusia region’s President Juan Manuel Moreno said.
PM cancels Davos trip
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez cancelled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Transport Minister Oscar Puente visited the crash site on Monday. Police drone footage showed how the trains came to a standstill 500 metres apart. One train’s carriage was split in two, and the locomotive was crushed like a tin can.
Experts studying the crash site found a broken joint on the rails, which created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track, according to a source briefed on initial investigations into the disaster. The technicians believe the faulty joint could prove important in identifying the precise cause of the accident, the source said.
Spain’s Commission of Investigation of Rail Accidents (CIAF), which has been tasked with the overall investigation into the causes of the disaster, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In Lahore, a large number of workers led by union secretary general Khurshid Ahmed staged a protest in front of the press club and chanted slogans against the government’s privatisation plan and inability to control price hike.
In his address, Khurshid Ahmed urged the prime minister and the energy minister to lift the nine-year-long ban on recruitment in the power sector, which has forced the existing staff to perform double duties and led to a rise in on-duty accidents involving line staff.
He demanded strict implementation of safety measures, including provision of protective gear to line staff.
He called for halting the privatisation of power companies in the national and public interest, instead of complying with the IMF demands, recalling that previous attempts to privatise Rawalpindi and Multan companies had failed.
He stated that electricity had become extremely expensive due to costly power purchases from independent power producers (IPPs), making life difficult for ordinary consumers, and urged the government to negotiate with their owners to reduce the exorbitant prices.
