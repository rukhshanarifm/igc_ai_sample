https://www.dawn.com/news/1968220,"Export-led growth is the way forward for Pakistan, says PM Shehbaz - Dawn","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that export-led growth was the only way forward for Pakistan.
The premier made the remarks while addressing a breakfast event at the Pakistan Pavilion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.
In his remarks, the premier said Pakistan “is moving forward with a sense of achievement and a sense of purpose”, noting a drop in the inflation rate and a reduction in the policy rate.
However, he noted that exports were facing challenges and that social indicators “need to be improved through continuous joint efforts”.
“Our exports, collectively, do face different kinds of challenges,” the premier noted. “But the way forward is very clear: Pakistan has to have export-led growth,” he asserted.
PM Shehbaz said that the government brought in “fundamental structural changes” to the system, such as digitalising revenue collection. He stated that the tax collection-to-GDP ratio stood at 10.5pc, compared to 9pc two years ago, hailing it as a “significant achievement”.
“We are now in the mines and minerals business in a big way,” PM Shehbaz added, citing agreements and memoranda of understanding with American and Chinese companies.
“Pakistan has been blessed with infinite natural resources still buried in the heap of mountains in the north of Pakistan, in Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan,” he said.
He added that Pakistan was “moving speedily” in the fields of cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and information technology (IT).
“Our IT exports have shown remarkable progress in the last few years, in that we brought a lot of instruments which have facilitated IT exports, which stand at $3bn annually,” he said.
In terms of the youth, PM Shehbaz said that the federal and provincial governments had enacted many programmes to empower the youth through vocational training.
“As a result, our youth [are] getting productive employment in Gulf states and other parts of the world because they are highly qualified and highly trained,” he emphasised.
PM Shehbaz then touched on improving relations with the United States, expressing the hope that Islamabad and Washington would “cooperate with each other in a big way” in the fields of mines and minerals, counter-terrorism, IT and AI.
“I think Pakistan is at a point in time where we are going to take off rapidly in agriculture, industry, the mining industry, AI and IT,” the prime minister said. “I think that the future is very promising, I have no doubt about it.”
Earlier, PM Shehbaz had met International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the WEF.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz briefed Georgieva on the improvement in Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators, stabilisation efforts and progress on institutional reforms.
He stressed Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal discipline, revenue mobilisation and sustainable development, the statement said.
The IMF official acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s reform efforts, the statement said. She stressed the importance of maintaining the momentum of reforms to ensure long-term economic resilience, it added.
The two sides discussed the global economic outlook, challenges faced by emerging economies and the importance of multilateral cooperation in safeguarding economic stability, it added.
Earlier, PM Shehbaz had also met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
According to the PMO, Mustafa expressed his heartfelt gratitude to PM Shehbaz for “Pakistan’s consistent, principled and unwavering support for the Palestinian people”.
“Mustafa personally walked up to PM Shehbaz and introduced himself,” the statement said.
“The Palestinian prime minister thanked Pakistan for supporting the Palestinian stance at international forums and for its role regarding the Palestinian cause,” it added.
The premier is on a three-day visit to the Swiss town (from January 20-22), primarily to lead a high-level delegation from Pakistan, including Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The premierarrivedin Davos on Tuesday. In a post on X, PM Shehbaz wrote that he was visiting Davos to advance Pakistan’s engagement at the WEF with global trade and investment partners.
“Pakistan’s ongoing economic reform journey is unlocking profound opportunities, driven by a resilient and entrepreneurial workforce and significant potential across energy, agriculture, minerals, and emerging technologies,” PM Shehbaz said.
He added that Pakistan was “ready to harness this potential into mutually beneficial economic cooperation and long-term investment”.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar inaugurated the Pathfinder Group’s Pakistan Pavilion on the sidelines of the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, according to a post by the Foreign Office on X.
The foreign minister lauded the initiative to showcase Pakistan’s vast economic potential and emerging opportunities on a global platform, while highlighting the dynamism and innovation of the country’s start-ups.
He underscored the critical role of start-ups in advancing socio-economic development and driving innovation across diverse sectors.
FM Dar reaffirmed the government’s commitment to facilitating and promoting entrepreneurs and start-ups, particularly those led by youth, to fully realise the economic potential.
In another post on X by the FO, the foreign minister met his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand on the sidelines of the WEF 2026 meeting.
The two foreign ministers “agreed to explore ways to enhance Pakistan-Canada ties” and “discussed to upscale and strengthen economic and trade relations”, the social media post said.
Later, a post by the FO said Dar also met Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen and expand Pak-Finland bilateral cooperation in key areas, including trade and investment,” the FO’s post stated.
It added that they also exchanged views on important regional and global developments.
“Both sides emphasised advancing a forward-looking and mutually beneficial partnership,” it further stated.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:03:26 GMT",,tax to GDP ratio Pakistan,PM Shehbaz Sharif said that export-led growth was the only way forward for Pakistan.

Speaking at the Pakis­tan Leadership Conversa­tion on Thursday, the minister emphasised collective acceleration, export-led growth, and investor-friendly reforms as key drivers for economic transformation.
Drawing lessons from China’s development journey, Mr Sheikh highlighted how China’s focus on value-added products and export-led growth transformed it into one of the world’s leading exporters.
He stressed that Pakistan can replicate this success by upgrading its production base, improving quality standards, and moving up the global value chain.
He underlined that future-fit and skilled human capital is critical for sustainable development, adding that productivity enhancement — not just headline GDP growth — must remain Pakistan’s economic north star. He emphasised technology adoption, managerial capacity, and SME formalisation to strengthen competitiveness.
Highlighting digital transformation, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh said that digital technologies, artificial intelligence, and fintech can enable Pakistan to leapfrog economically, provided adoption moves from pilot projects to large-scale platforms.
Referring to improving market sentiment, the investment minister noted that rising investor confidence reflected in the stock market performance indicates growing trust in Pakistan’s economic direction.
Reaffirming the prime minister’s vision, he stated that the government is implementing investor-friendly reforms to improve ease of doing business and ensure regulatory predictability.
The minister informed investors that special economic zones offer a ten-year income tax exemption, while around 6,000 acres of land are available near Port Qasim for investment purposes. He further highlighted that the Business Facilitation Centre is providing one-window solutions to domestic and foreign investors.
He concluded by reiterating that the Board of Investment remains committed to providing all possible facilitation to foreign investors and positioning Pakistan as a competitive, reliable, and future-ready investment destination.

The outlook for a consensus on the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) award currently appears murky within set timelines, both in cases of vertical and horizontal resource distribution as well as sharing of expenditures among the stakeholders.
So far, the working groups, according to a media report, have made limited progress, which, as per the report, makes it difficult for the consolidation of their recommendations within the time frame. The commission was due to meet in January.
Despite the tough challenges they face, it is incumbent on all stakeholders to join hands to achieve a consensus on the new NFC award, upholding the rights of the federating units.
No doubt, the eight working groups set up by the federal government include issues with no easy solutions. They will recommend the percentage of resources to be distributed between the centre and the four provinces, the vertical transfers, national debt composition and its utilisation, and the inclusion or exclusion of certain taxes in the divisible pool.
Provincial representatives insist on greater autonomy, citing increased tax revenue collection over the past year, even as the NFC award continues to be delayed
The centre, says a The Express Tribune analyst, wants to exclude customs duties from the purview of the divisible pool that is divided among the five governments. According to the Revenue Division Year Book 2025, the provisional net total collection of customs duty by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was Rs1.28 trillion in FY25 or 10.9pc of the total tax revenue.
Similarly, in the NFC group meeting on the sharing of divisible pool resources for the federally administered tribal districts merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), the KP government has reportedly proposed the creation of a 10-year special grant from the federal divisible pool to address what it described as “historical development deficits” in the merged area. The grant, officials said, would bring the region on a par with the rest of KP and the country. However, the federal government says the province is getting its due share.
The International Monetary Fund projects Pakistan’s provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to rise from 0.9pc in FY25 to 1.6pc by FY28, with total collections expected to exceed Rs3.1tr by FY30. The federal tax revenue is expected to remain largely flat during this period. The Fund says the future revenue growth will be driven mainly by provinces.
However, the Fund notes that this provincial revenue increase is contingent on the successful rollout of agricultural income tax (AIT) reforms and an expanded sales tax on services.Significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, including fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities.
Former FBR chairman Syed Shabbar Zaidi says the exemption from the levy of Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act 2011 should be removed, and all retailers and wholesalers should be subjected to taxation under the Act. The jurisdiction of the Federal Sales Tax Act 1990 should end, and registration of such retailers and wholesalers should be transferred to the provinces.
The Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) has posted a robust half-yearly growth of 21pc for FY26 by collecting Rs161.4bn compared to Rs133.3bn in FY25. In December, SRB recorded a surge in revenues by 25pc.
And on Dec 9, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had urged the government to transfer the collection of sales tax on goods to the provinces, saying the provinces have proven their capacity to take the lead in collecting the sales tax on services after the 18th Amendment.
According to the Revenue Division Year Book, the total net sales tax collection was provisionally estimated at Rs3.9tr for FY25 or 33.2pc of the federal tax revenue.
A working group chaired by KP’s Finance Minister will now “deliberate and suggest measures for improving the overall tax-to-GDP ratio”. Notable here is that the KP Revenue Authority recorded a 30pc increase in collection of sales tax on services amounting to Rs23.3bn during the first six months of this fiscal year compared to Rs17.9bn in the same period last year.
The Centre has been levying presumptive taxes on services under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, sales tax on gas, electricity and telephone services and federal excise duty on several services, according to analysts Huzaima Bokhari, Dr Ikramul Haq and Abdul Rauf Shakoori. In a joint Business Recorder article, they wrote that the present situation on the financial front could have been avoided had the centre allowed the provinces to generate their own resources through sales tax on goods.
Despite the constitutional requirement to allocate 57.5pc of the NFC divisible pool to provinces, Dr Hafiz Pasha said they received only 45.8pc in the last fiscal year. Speaking at a Social Policy and Development Committee seminar on NFC recently, he explained that a nearly 12pc share was withheld either by charging petroleum levy on products that are not part of the divisible pool or by getting back transferred money in the shape of cash surpluses. The federal government collected over Rs1.2tr in petroleum levy, and the provinces also saved Rs921bn as cash surplus.
As highlighted in a 2023 World Bank report, the federal government retains ministries linked to devolved subjects and spent Rs328bn on them. A working group will make recommendations on sharing financial expenses incurred by the federation in areas under provincial jurisdiction.

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs6.159 trillion during July-December FY26 against the target of Rs6.490tr, a shortfall of Rs331bn. However, it is 10pc higher compared to the year-ago figure of Rs5.618tr.
The borrowing in 1HFY26 means the government spent much higher than the last year.
This is also interesting to note that the State Bank reported a net profit of Rs2.5tr for FY25, which was transferred to the federal government. Despite this additional liquidity, the government is borrowing heavily from banks.
Banks are comfortable to invest in the government papers as they get risk-free high yields which made the financial sector most stable financial sector.
Last week the banks bids for the treasury bills auctions were Rs2.5tr reflecting the eagerness of banks to park their liquidity in the safest place.
“Investments in government securities remained the main driver of banking sector balance sheet,” said the State Bank in its annual report for 2024-25.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968330,FBR flags tax evasion in Sindh solar imports - Dawn,"• Report highlights trade-based money laundering in solar kit imports• Senate panel fumes over absence of economic minister, provincial secretaries
ISLAMABAD: Another episode of massive under-invoicing for tax evasion and trade-based money laundering through the import of solar kits came to light before a parliamentary committee, which expressed serious displeasure over the continued absence of the minister for economic affairs and provincial secretaries.
The Senate Secretariat released selected operational parts of a report presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), detailing grave irregularities in the import of solar home system kits under the Sindh Solar Energy Project (SSEP).
The report revealed that solar kits were declared at $16-$23.4 per unit for tax purposes by contractors, while payments of up to $112.44 per unit, or about 700 per cent higher, were made by the World Bank for the SSEP, reflecting a difference of $89-96 per unit. Investigations are underway into trade-based money laundering, tax evasion, fund layering and violations of foreign exchange rules.
According to the report, M/s Beyond Green, Karachi, imported 10 consignments comprising 200,968 solar home system units between December 2024 and July 2025 through clearing agent M/s Vista Impex. The goods were declared under HS Codes 8501.7210 and 8501.711, attracting zero customs duty, 18pc sales tax, 3pc additional sales tax and zero income tax. Declared unit values ranged from $16.1 to $23.4, and four consignments were cleared through the Green Channel.
Subsequent verification revealed that the goods declarations (GDs) submitted to the Sindh government were either fake or tampered with, a fact officially conveyed on Oct 9, 2025. Further investigation showed that the same kits were supplied to the Sindh government at manifold higher prices.
Official contracts under the SSEP with M/s Shenzhen LEMI Technology Development Co Ltd, China, revealed a contractual price of approximately $112.44 per kit, excluding duties and taxes. The World Bank reportedly paid this amount directly to the supplier, the FBR report said.
For tax purposes, the transactional value was worked out at $103.08 per unit, leading to the forwarding of 10 contraventions to customs adjudication authorities. Show-cause notices have been issued and the matter is pending adjudication.
The Senate committee was inf­or­med that fake invoices amounting to $12.5 million were also generat­­ed. In addition, evidence suggested third-party remittances routed through UAE-based entities, raising alarms of trade-based money laundering, foreign exchange violations and fund layering. The case has been referred for proceedings under the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010, while a comprehensive sales tax audit has been recommended.
The committee was told that the SSEP implementation period ended on July 31, 2025, but around 30,000 solar kits out of 200,000 could not be distributed within the planned period and would now be handled under a separate arrangement.
Following the identification of discrepancies, the Sindh cabinet had on Dec 1, 2025 referred the matter to the Enquiries and Anti-Corruption Establishment (EACE). A forensic audit has also been approved and is underway, while the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has taken cognisance of the case and is actively investigating.
On these revelations, committee chairman Saifullah Abro asked whether any suspensions of suspected officials had taken place and was informed that no suspensions had occurred so far. He directed that a letter be written to the chief minister to ensure that all individuals involved were held accountable.
Minister’s absence
Earlier, the Senate panel expressed sharp criticism over the continued absence of Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema and senior bureaucrats, as well as the participation of junior officers from provincial governments, terming it a serious disregard for parliamentary oversight.
An additional secretary from the Economic Affairs Division informed the committee that the minister was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos. The explanation failed to satisfy the senators, with PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi remarking that he did not recall the minister ever attending a committee meeting and demanding that the minister’s chair be removed.
Chairman Saifullah Abro reminded the meeting that parliamentary rules were explicit, stating that the membership of a committee member or the minister could be cancelled in case of absence on three occasions without prior notice.
“If the minister wants to increase corruption, then he should definitely not be in the committee, but if he wants to stop corruption, then he should come to the committee,” he said, directing that a message be conveyed to the minister that he had not been attending the panel for two years.
“We are not removing the minister’s chair, but tell him that this behaviour is not good,” Senator Abro said.
During the meeting, agenda items related to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa projects were postponed and provincial officers were asked to leave after it emerged that officials below grade-20 had been deputed to represent the province.
The committee decided that a formal letter be written to the KP chief secretary to ensure that provincial secretaries attend the next meeting, failing which the matter would be referred to the Privileges Committee.

ISLAMABAD: A lawmaker from the ruling PML-N claimed on Tuesday that there had to be some officials connivance at play, as he highlighted the theft of Pakistanis’ personal data, saying that it was available on the dark web.
Senator Afnanullah Khan made the remarks during a meeting of the Senate Standing Com­mittee on Interior.
“It is the latest data… and it is such good data that we might not have such well-processed data. For example, they have consolidated data from the National Database and Registration Autho­rity (Nadra), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and banks in a dataset,” he said.
“And you can get anyone’s data for Rs500, and if you want that of the entire country, you will get it for Rs70-80 billion. Data worth Rs70-80bn is [available] on the dark web,” the senator said.
The dark web refers to websites that are not indexed by search engi­nes, and are usually encry­pted, only accessible through specialised browsers. This heightened anonymity makes it a hotbed for illegal activities, such as drug and/or arms sales, fraud and data theft etc.
Senator Afnanullah pointed out that when the data of any individual was stolen, it could be used for any purpose, including obtaining passports and identity cards for others.
“Why is Pakistanis’ data stolen time and again?” he asked.
Addressing Mustafa Jamal Kazi of the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports, he added: “Let me tell you one thing; without the [involvement of] people inside the organisation, data theft at such a large scale is not possible. It is impossible. The data of 240 million people cannot be stolen just like that.”
Later, speaking to Dawn, the PML-N senator asserted that this data could not have been leaked without the involvement of officials in the Nadra and Immig­ration and Passports Directorate General.
In the meeting, Committee Cha­i­r­person and PTI Senator Faisal Saleem Rahman had asked Mr Kazi whether any investigation had been carried out in this regard.
Mr Kazi responded that a probe had been conducted and officials had also been removed.
Senator Rahman also stressed the need for ensuring the protection of law enforcement bodies’data. “Who will be responsible if their data is leaked?” he said.
Proposal to ban social media platforms
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry also attended the meeting, and raised the issue of the use of social media by terrorists.
“Previously, terrorists used guns. Now, they are using social media,” he said, adding that social media companies would not even share the internet protocol addresses of users operating accounts being used for terrorism.
Speaking on the matter, Senator Rahman suggested that the government should enter into a contract with social media platforms. He further advised that platforms that did not cooperate with the government should be banned.
PPP Senator Palwasha Khan endorsed these views, saying: “A ban should definitely be imposed.”
Senator Rahman further pointed out that China had its own social media platforms and said, “There is no need to employ the services of those [companies] that are not cooperating.”
Chaudhry responded to the suggestion, saying: “This is a big decision, you can take it. If we take it, it will be called an attack on the freedom of expression.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968540,Used phone rates to fall as govt revisits valuation - Dawn,"• Ruling covers 62 models across Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, OnePlus• iPhones see steepest cuts • Values apply regardless of condition; accessories not included• Phones must be activated six months before import
ISLAMABAD: As mobile phone prices remain elevated for new buyers due to higher assessed values, the Customs Valuation Department has reduced assessment rates for duties and taxes on the commercial import of used and old mobile phone sets to ease pressure on consumers in the used smartphone market.
At the same time, fresh assessment values have been set for high-end used iPhone models, ranging from the iPhone 14 and its variants to the iPhone 15 series. For Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus, the assessed rates have largely been left unchanged or fixed for the first time.
The revised rates were notified through Valuation Ruling No. 2035 of 2026, which will come into effect from Jan 16, 2026.
Customs officials said the revision reflects a decline in international prices of older smartphones, particularly iPhones, as these devices approach the end of their commercial life cycle.
The downward adjustment, they added, is intended to align valuations with market rates and ensure the benefit is passed on to end consumers through lower duties and, potentially, lower retail prices.
Officials said the new ruling covers 62 mobile phone models across four leading brands, either through revised values or first-time valuation. They said the methodology relied on market inquiries, benchmarked against trade-in prices published on the official websites of manufacturers, including Samsung, Google and OnePlus.
The government levies multiple charges on mobile phones, including a flat Rs250 per set, 18 per cent sales tax, withholding tax, a handset levy and regulatory duties. These are calculated on the notified assessed value of each handset.
A comparison of values notified for 2026 with those issued in 2024 shows a sharp reduction in assessed values for used phones. Used iPhones recorded the steepest cuts, with declines ranging from 32pc to 81pc.
Among the biggest revisions, the assessed value of the iPhone 12 Pro fell to $155 from $280, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max was reduced to $215 from $340.
The iPhone 13 was cut to $170 from $280, the iPhone 11 Pro Max to $145 from $245, and the iPhone XS Max to $95 from $150. The iPhone X was lowered to $57 from $75.
Even newer flagship models were revised downwards, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max reduced to $295 from $430, and the iPhone 13 Pro to $225 from $360.
The department also fixed assessment values for seven newer used iPhone models. Under the new rates, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been valued at $460, the iPhone 15 Pro at $390, the iPhone 15 Plus at $320, and the iPhone 15 at $310.
For the iPhone 14 lineup, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has been assessed at $360, the iPhone 14 Pro at $290, and the iPhone 14 at $210.
Samsung, Google, OnePlus
By contrast, valuations for other major brands were largely unchanged. Only a marginal adjustment was recorded for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which was assessed at $255, reflecting a modest decline.
Other Samsung models were valued at lower but steady levels, with the Galaxy S23 Plus assessed at $160, the Galaxy S23 at $140, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G at $160. Older models included the Galaxy S21 Plus 5G at $69, the Galaxy S21 5G at $50, the Galaxy S20 Plus at $46, and the Galaxy S20 at $41.
For Google Pixel devices, the ruling fixed values across newer and older models, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL at $260, the Pixel 9 Pro at $195, and the Pixel 9 at $150. The Pixel 8 Pro was valued at $188 and the Pixel 8 at $98.
A similar pattern was reported for OnePlus phones, with the OnePlus 12 assessed at $184 and the OnePlus 12R at $105, while older models were valued at $92 for the OnePlus 11, $65 for the OnePlus 10 Pro, and $60 for the OnePlus 10T.
According to the ruling, the notified values will apply to used mobile phones imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, and will form the basis for the assessment of duties and taxes at the time of import. The values will apply regardless of the specific grade or condition of the phones.
It further stipulates that devices must have been activated at least six months prior to export to Pakistan. Importers will be required to declare the activation period, which will be verified by assessing officers during clearance.
Customs officials said the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held consultations with stakeholders on Aug 12, Sept 26 and Dec 15 last year. Import data covering a 90-day period was collected and analysed, while market inquiries were carried out to determine revised values.
For brands and models imported commercially but not listed in the ruling, importers have been advised to determine assessable values under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967697,Pakistan’s exchange rate illusion - Dawn,"The exchange rate is a critical economic variable for Pakistan. A competitive and credible currency regime should form the core of the nation’s economic strategy, particularly given the country’s dependence on foreign exchange for growth.
Unfortunately, Pakistan has repeatedly used the exchange rate as a short-term stabilisation tool, often holding it at levels that favour political convenience rather than economic fundamentals. Once reserves are depleted, this approach has led to abrupt and disruptive corrections consistently undermining rather than enhancing export potential.
That said, it is incredibly important to have a competitive exchange rate as it improves export margins, encourages investment in tradable goods, and signals the viability of producing for global markets.
History shows that prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports
However, rate alone is insufficient; credibility is equally essential. Exporters are willing to invest and scale up operations only if they trust that relative prices will remain broadly aligned with fundamentals over time. In Pakistan’s case, this trust has been repeatedly eroded.
The Musharraf era
During the Musharraf administration, the rupee was kept stable at around Rs60 to the dollar throughout much of the 2000s. While this stability created an illusion of macroeconomic soundness, it concealed growing external imbalances.
When the pressures finally surfaced, the adjustment was late and severe: from 2007 to 2009, the rupee dropped from roughly Rs60 to over Rs80 per dollar as reserves collapsed and an International Monetary Fund intervention became necessary. Exporters, who had operated under an overvalued currency, did not suddenly become competitive. Instead, they faced higher input costs, disrupted financing, and weakened financial positions.
Stability over fundamentals
The above pattern recurred between 2013 and 2017, with the rupee held between Rs100–105 per dollar despite widening current-account deficits and falling reserves. Exporters consistently warned about the currency’s overvaluation, but policy makers focused on maintaining price stability and political optics. When the inevitable adjustment occurred, it was abrupt and disorderly: the rupee’s value dropped sharply in mid-2017, followed by a larger correction after 2018, reaching around Rs160 per dollar by mid-2019. This sudden realignment destabilised firms and inflation expectations instead of supporting a smooth transition.
Market distortions and eroding confidence
The last three years have proven even more damaging. Administrative controls, delayed adjustments, and the emergence of multiple exchange rates pushed pressure into informal markets.
In early 2023, the rupee experienced one of its steepest single-day falls, losing nearly 10 per cent within hours. Over the year, it depreciated by close to 30pc percent, at one point briefly approaching Rs300 per dollar before settling near Rs285 when administrative controls were introduced.
These shifts coincided with harsh stabilisation measures such as import compression, punitive interest rates, higher energy prices, and increased taxes. Any potential export gains from depreciation were negated by rising costs and collapsing confidence.
Repeatedly underminig exports
These episodes highlight a clear lesson: prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax onexportsand a subsidy to imports. This encourages consumption and rent-seeking while discouraging investment in tradable sectors. When adjustment is finally forced, it comes as a crisis — too sudden and volatile to generate the intended export response. Exporters cannot recover lost markets overnight, nor can they invest amidst uncertainty and tightening financial conditions.
Gradual adjustment and integrated policy
Successful export economies do not rely on dramatic devaluations. Instead, they allow gradual, market-aligned adjustments, avoid prolonged misalignments, and resist using the exchange rate as a political tool. Effective currency policy is complemented by competitive energy pricing, predictable taxation, efficient logistics, and skills development, enabling exporters to respond to price signals.
For example, Vietnam has pursued gradual adjustments that avoid prolonged overvaluation and limit volatility, giving exporters the confidence to invest and integrate into global value chains. Bangladesh has similarly adopted a steady crawl rather than crisis-driven devaluations, preserving export competitiveness and market share — a model Pakistan has repeatedly failed to emulate.
Conclusion: toward a credible exchange rate policy
Pakistan’s core issue is not deciding between a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ rupee. Rather, it is the persistent belief that administrative controls can substitute for competitiveness. Until the exchange-rate policy reflects fundamentals on a sustained basis and is part of a broader, credible export strategy, depreciation will remain disruptive, and exports will continue to be vulnerable to future crises.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968379/soes-an-eclectic-approach,SOEs: an eclectic approach - Dawn,"A CONTROVERSY is raging on both mainstream and social media over PIA’s recentprivatisation. Unless this debate is addressed rationally, future privatisation transactions may also be at risk. Past experience offers a cautionary lesson: the Supreme Court’s decision to annul the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills did not revive the enterprise; instead, it led to itsclosurein 2015 and significantly slowed the overall privatisation process.
The popular binary often advanced — either retain enterprises under government ownership or privatise them — is flawed. Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations rather than ideological preferences. Pakistan has 85 commercial SOEs for diverse purposes across power, oil and gas; transport and communications; manufacturing, mining and engineering; finance; industrial estate development and management; and wholesale and retail trade. Of these, 51 are currently profitable. The argument that profitable SOEs should never be divested is as untenable as the view that all 34 lossmaking entities must be privatised. Neither ownership per se nor current financial performance should solely determine policy.
The basic principle for deciding whether an economic activity should be undertaken by the government — through its departments or through an SOE — rests on two questions: a) does the activity fall within the government’s public policy framework? b) Can it be adequately performed by the private sector?
Relevance to public policy framework:The PPF reflects the government’s development priorities, as articulated in documents such as the Principles of Policy (Article 3 of the Constitution) and sectoral policies relating to agriculture, industry, trade, etc. In assessing alignment with the PPF, it is necessary to consider whether an SOE is connected to one or more core state functions — i) ensuring national food security; ii) developing and managing large-scale infrastructure; iii) national defence and security-related activities; iv) entities established through government-to-government or intergovernmental arrangements; and v) provision of goods and services of critical national economic interest. If an SOE falls into any of these categories, there is a prima facie case for retaining it under government control. The decision then is whether it should be retained in its existing form or restructured to improve performance.
Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations.
Market failure considerations:The second question concerns market failure: can the private sector adequately deliver the relevant activity? Each SOE must be evaluated in terms of its operations, functions and market structure, with attention to the following: a) is the SOE a natural monopoly; if so, does an effective regulatory framework exist to ensure socially optimal and cost-effective service delivery under private ownership? b) Does the SOE perform a function that generates significant positive externalities and is, therefore, insufficiently profitable for the private sector to undertake? c) Are there alternative delivery mechanisms to achieve the same objectives?
Where market failure prevents the private sector from maximising social welfare, the government has a strong case for retaining control. Even then, competition can be introduced by dismantling monopolies where feasible and establishing strong, independent regulatory agencies.
Financial viability:While several SOEs report accounting profits, financial viability requires more rigorous assessment. The key question is whether the organisation can generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, meet debt obligations, and, where relevant, finance investment for growth while maintaining acceptable service standards. The financial viability test should be based on the following: a) Negative shareholders’ equity: Any entity with negative equity for the past three years is financially stressed, as its balance sheet is not bankable and it remains dependent on government guarantees or direct budgetary support. b) Continuous losses: Entities incurring losses over the last three years are similarly stressed, as losses either necessitate government support or gradually erode equity. c) Return on assets: While return on equity is a standard metric, ROA is more appropriate when equity is negative. ROA measures how effectively management uses assets to generate earnings. SOEs with an ROA below five per cent for three consecutive years should be considered financially stressed.
In such cases, financial restructuring is the first step. If restructuring fails under government ownership due to extraneous constraints, alternative options — such as outsourcing, leasing, concession agreements, or transfer of managerial control — should be considered. SOEs that don’t meet public policy criteria, don’t address market failure concerns, or cannot be made viable even after restructuring are prime candidates for privatisation, liquidation, or winding up.
Lessons from successful privatisation:Pakistan’s main privatisation success stories are the banking and telecom sectors. In banking, the share of assets held by nationalised commercial banks declined from around 80pc to about 20pc following privatisation. Prior to 2003, the government injected Rs46 billion to recapitalise lossmaking banks; non-performing loans stood at 25pc, and financial soundness indicators were weak. Since privatisation, four major banks (HBL, UBL, MCB, and ABL) have contributed Rs245bn in corporate taxes in 2024 with cumulative contributions exceeding Rs1.6 trillion since 2004. NPLs have fallen below 7pc, provisioning exceeds 100pc, and overall financial soundness has improved.
The main weakness in recent years is the growing role of banks as public sector financiers, reflected in a declining advance-to-deposit ratio. Importantly, public sector banks such as the NBP and the Bank of Punjab have also improved under a competitive market structure and rank among the top 15 Asia-Pacific banks. The ideological argument that these institutions must also be privatised ignores the empirical evidence that ownership itself is not the decisive factor.
PIA’s case:Applying this framework (spelt out in the SOE Triage Report 2021) to PIA leads to a clear conclusion: there were no compelling public policy or market failure reasons for retaining it under government control. The aviation industry is competitive, and private operators have proved their capacity to perform effectively. Despite repeated restructuring efforts, PIA accumulated losses of Rs850bn. The privatisation objective was not short-term maximisation of sale proceeds but elimination of recurring losses and revival of the airline as an efficient enterprise. Over the longer term, improved performance under private management is expected to generate a steady stream of tax revenues rather than drain the exchequer. In sum, Pakistan needs an eclectic, evidence-based approach to SOEs, which transcends ideological divides and focuses squarely on public policy relevance, market structure, and financial viability.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968546,Nestle plans $60m business expansion - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Nestle, the multinational food and beverage company, on Thursday announced an additional $60 million investment in Pakistan during a roundtable discussion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the business round-table, bringing together CEOs and senior leaders of leading global corporations to discuss Pakistan’s reform trajectory, investment climate, and long-term growth potential.
The announcement of additional investment was made by Nestle’s Executive Vice-President and Chief Executive Officer for Asia, Oceania and Africa, Remy Ejel, said a press release issued by the finance ministry.
He said that Nestle would undertake a robust expansion of its operations, reaffirming its long-term commitment to Pakistan.
The roundtable was part of the government’s ongoing engagement with multinational investors to promote policy predictability, economic formalisation, and sustainable, export-oriented growth, the press release added.
Mr Ejel further annou­nced that Nestle intends to use Pakistan as a regional manufacturing hub to export products to 26 countries. Expressing stro­ng confidence in the economic outlook, he foresaw robust business growth in the coming years.
The announcement builds on Nestle’s recent engagement with the finance minister in Islamabad, where the company had outlined its strategy centred on localisation, advanced manufacturing, sustainability, and agricultural transformation.
Nestle has made significant progress in technology-driven manufacturing, with highly automated facilities, expanded use of renewable energy, improved packaging solutions, and digitalised supply chains, strengthening efficiency while reducing environmental impact.
Mr Ejel highlighted Nestle’s global scale as one of the world’s leading food, beverage, nutrition, and health companies, with operations in over 180 countries, a workforce exceeding 277,000 employees, and global revenues of approximately $114.25 billion in 2025.
He noted that Pakistan’s demographic profile, growing nutrition needs, and underpenetrated value-added food segments closely mirror successful growth trajectories seen in Southeast Asia.
Welcoming Nestle’s investment announcement, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb described it as a strong vote of confidence in Pakistan’s economic reforms and formalisation drive.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening the tax ecosystem, ensuring policy consistency, and facilitating responsible long-term investment through continued engagement with the private sector, including via the Tax Policy Office established within the Finance Division.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968559,Democracy & capitalism’s shadow - Dawn,"“THE top 10% own three-quarters of global wealth, while the bottom half holds only 2%.” So states the World Inequality Report 2026. Can democracy survive when capitalism concentrates wealth so drastically?
The belief that democracy and capitalism are natural allies is as widespread as it is inaccurate. To see this, one has only to observe capitalist accumulation under authoritarian political arrangements. The UAE is just one such example. Why then does this belief persist?
Democracy and capitalism often journey together — until they don’t. To a point, they do support each other. This is why it is not easy to find democracies without capitalism. Think of a society, poor and authoritarian, that then undergoes a revolutionary change that makes it both democratic and capitalist. For a while, the two wo­­uld go together. Democracy would bring freedom and political equality; capitalism would bring resources.
Even Marx acknowledged that capitalism creates ‘colossal productive forces’. The growing middle class would demand greater freedoms and consumption, thereby strengthening both democracy and capitalism. For some time, prosperity and empowerment would rise together.
But this harmonious co-existence would soon wear off. Democracy is about political equality. Capitalism, by design, needs economic inequality. The two would eventually collide. In time, the wealth generated by capitalism starts to pool in fewer and fewer pockets. Growth continues, distribution falters. Tensions begin to appear.
Democracy is about political equality. Capitalism, by design, needs economic inequality.
This concentration is not just financial. Being rich doesn’t just mean plush houses or private jets. It means connections and information, as the wealthy form exclusive social ties, venture together, share insights and tastes, thus increasing their collective purse. French sociologist Bourdieu has called this social capital, “aggregate of actual or potential resources” that bring tangible benefits. High-profile events such as the Ambani wedding illustrate how this transformation happens. But the process does not stop here.
Social capital soon becomes political capital, with the wealthy getting access to the political class, who make laws. The role of the corporate lobby and campaign funding is well documented. These are some of the ways in which wealth buys political influence. Elon Musk’s access to and authority in the White House was an example of the political power wealth can bring. Consequently, economic values of capitalism start to prevail over the political ideals of democracy, human rights and political equality, as the market dictates the state.
We have drifted far away from the attractive capitalist rhetoric of riches through hard work and entrepreneurship. Now, wealth generates wealth, creating inequalities not justifiable through merit. That inequality is endemic to capitalism and not just an irritating bug, is well shown by Thomas Piketty, who demonstrated that the return on capital (rent) grows faster than the return on labour (income). Proponents of capitalism may insist that inequality brings growth but such justifications ring hollow when wealth buys disproportionate political influence.
One would expect that, in a democracy, as people realise the asymmetry of wealth distribution they feel relatively poorer, and experience alienation in economic and political spheres, they would vote against such a system, demand reforms, regulatory constraints and a redirection. In theory, democracy should prevent capitalism from reaching its logical outcome of concentrating wealth among a small elite. Yet that concentration of wealth is exactly what has been happening. Why?
When people suffer, they seek an explanation. Here, the narratives people have to make sense of their condition become important. There is a leftist narrative, including democratic socialism, which explains the alienation through a critique of capitalism, giving an economic explanation. But there is very little space for such narratives in school curricula or on the mainstream media. Instead, two other narratives prevail as they are pushed through by the mostly corporate-owned media. It is not an accident that some of the most powerful media outlets today — both conventional and social — are owned by billionaires or corporations.
The liberal media supports capitalism, insisting on its necessity for democracy. It projects billionaires as self-made, implying anyone can succeed. In the process, the role of inheritance, connections, tax evasion, low wages and corporate welfare is pushed under the carpet. The poor are blamed for their condition, as if it has nothing to do with systemic biases, inequitable access to education and capital or with historical injustices. This narrative claims capitalism as a bastion of innovation but sidelines the fact that only those advancements that bring profit are allowed, not those that genuinely improve human life. This glamorised but distorted storyline leaves people stuck between conviction (that they can make it) and anxiety (that they cannot).
The right-wing — and increasingly even sections of liberal — media weaponise panic and resentment against migrants, selected racial and religious groups, and unconventional identities by whispering that these ‘unwashed’ have stolen the wealth of the suffering workers. In time, these narratives cleverly divert the anger and distress resulting from capitalistic alienation towards oneself, fuelling an epidemic of mental illness, or towards creating scapegoats — while sparing capitalism and its contradictions. Unsurprisingly, a recent survey in the US showed that only 52pc of the least financially secure thought democracy was the best form of government; those who need it the most trust it the least. This misdirected rage is visible in many countries today, particularly in the US, UK and India.
To conclude, democracy and capitalism may begin as partners but soon the relationship turns antagonistic. Capital, with its material resources, seeks to break any restraints on it. Those who want both democracy and capitalism must build bulwarks — a social contract that curbs wealth concentration and ensures public ownership of sectors, education and health in particular — crucial for equality of opportunities. A critical political education of citizens, young and old, is also needed so that they do not fall for destructive narratives and are not diverted from the real causes of malaise. If democracy is to endure, it must tame capitalism, not merely coexist with it.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963309,FBR cracks down on healthcare tax evasion - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has intensified its enforcement drive across the country against tax evasion in the private healthcare sector by placing Inland Revenue Service (IRS) officers directly at the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, senior tax officials toldDawnon Thursday.
The move marks a shift toward on-site monitoring as authorities seek to curb underreporting of taxable income in one of the country’s most lucrative professional sectors. The initiative gained mom­entum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.
Official figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan’s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns for TY2025.
Of the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns for TY2025, only 43.20pc of those exist on tax rolls with the tax authorities, placing the profession among the least compliant sectors in the tax system.
Moreover, even among those who filed tax returns, income declarations point to widespread underreporting, raising questions about enforcement, transparency, and the credibility of declared earnings within one of the country’s most established and high earning professions.
Officers deputed at private hospitals to monitor revenue and ensure tax compliance
A senior tax official toldDawnthat the FBR has begun deploying IRS officers directly at the premises of commercial entities, including private hospitals and clinics, to strengthen monitoring and enforcement. According to the official, these officers are tasked with observing the provision of medical services and the collection of receipts in real time.
In the first phase, officers have been posted at 50 commercial hospitals under Section175-C of the Income Tax Ordinance. The objective is to identify underreporting of revenues, particularly from high inpatient occupancy charges that, in some cases, exceed the rates charged by five star hotels.
“We will identify non-compliant doctors through this exercise,” the official said, adding that private notices are being issued to encourage voluntary compliance. The official noted that voluntary compliance from doctors has already begun following the issuance of these notices.
The data place the number of registered doctors on the tax rolls at 130,243, of whom 56,287 filed income tax returns in TY2025, about 43pc of those registered. Among the filers, 48,704 doctors declared income, representing roughly 87pc of those who submitted returns.
Official figures showed that only around two in five registered doctors filed income tax returns in TY2025, with an even smaller share reporting taxable income.
However, 7,583 doctors reported zero income in their tax returns for TY2025.
Further analysis of the returns showed that 30,000 doctors of the 48,704 doctors have declared less than Rs2 million annual income, which accounted for 61.59pc of all doctors who declared taxable income in their returns. This percentage goes to 65 percent of total return filers, who declared less than Rs2 million annual income.
Moreover, most doctors fall in the lower reported income brackets.
Within the below Rs2m income bracket, the breakdown of tax returns declarations further highlights the scale of low declared earnings.
As many as 341 doctors reported annual income between Re1 and Rs100,000 in their returns, 17,647 doctors declared income ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1m, while 12,959 reported annual earnings between Rs1m and Rs2m for TY2025.
According to data, a sharp decline in the number of doctors as income levels rise. The data show 6,655 doctors fall within the Rs2m to Rs3m annual income bracket, 6,959 doctors are in the Rs3m to Rs5m range, and 3,093 doctors declared annual income between Rs5m and Rs10m.
At the highest end of the scale, only 1,050 doctors declared annual income exceeding Rs10m in TY2025.According to the FBR, statistics highlight two gaps, first between registered doctors and those filing their tax returns, and second between filers and the income levels declared with the largest concentration of declarations below Rs2m per year in TY2025.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968418,Customs issues new valuation ruling for old and used mobile phones - Dawn,"The Directorate General of Customs Valuation has revised the determination of customs values for old and used mobile phones, particularly those imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, as per a ruling dated January 16.
The ruling,Valuation Ruling No. 2035/2026, specifies customs values for 62 models of old and used mobile phones without packaging and accessories in commercial quantities. Brands of these phones include Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, and OnePlus devices. These new values will be used to assess the duty and tax when the models are imported in commercial quantities.
The customs values will apply irrespective of any specific grade of the used mobile phones, according to the ruling. It also requires that the phones must have been activated at least six months before being exported to Pakistan. Importers are required to declare this activation period, which will then be verified by assessing officers.
This ruling has been issued under Section 25A of the Customs Act, 1969, and supersedes the Valuation Ruling No. 1893/2024 from June 27, 2024. This ruling will remain applicable unless rescinded or revised in terms of Section 25A(4) of the same Act.
According to the issued ruling, the existing valuation was more than a year old and was no longer reflective of international market conditions.
In determining the new customs values, the methods provided under Section 25 of the Customs Act were applied in sequential order. The transaction value method under Section 25(1) was found inapplicable as the declared values did not correspond to market prices. The identical goods method under Section 25(5) and the similar goods method under Section 25(6) were also tried, but it was ascertained that they were not reliable metrics due to incomplete information and consistent variations in declared values.
Therefore, the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held meetings with relevant stakeholders on August 12, September 26, and December 15 of the last calendar year to come to this re-determination. During the process, 90 days of import data were retrieved and scrutinised, and marked inquiries were conducted in accordance with Office Order No. 17/2014 under Section 25(7) of the Customs Act, 1969, after adjusting product amounts to arrive at C&F values.
For brands and models of mobile phones imported in commercial quantities, but not listed under the ruling, those concerned have been advised to assess the goods under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.
The ruling notes that where declared values or invoiced values are higher than the customs values, the ruling will be made on the higher value in terms of Section 25(1) of the Act. In the case of consignments imported by air, the difference between air and sea freight will be added for the valuation.
Customs authorities have been directed to ensure the implementation of the valuation ruling and to report any anomalies to the Directorate General.","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:11:23 GMT",,customs duty Pakistan,"The new values will be used to assess the duty and tax when the models are imported in.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1966865,FCC endorses cooperative federalism in ruling on excise duty tweaks - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu­tio­nal Court (FCC) on Tuesday ruled that a federal law imposing excise duty and a provincial law aimed at advancing labour welfare, though overlapping in scope, do not conflict with each other and instead operate within their respective spheres of legislative competence, rendering both constitutionally valid.
“Both enactments stand on firm constitutional footing, not in conflict but in constitutional harmony, each valid in its own aspect,” observed Justice Aamer Farooq, who headed a two-judge FCC bench that dismissed a challenge filed by Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd against amendments introduced by the Balochistan government to a federal excise law.
In its 15-page verdict, the court explained that while the imposition of excise duty squarely falls within federal legislative competence, the advancement of labour welfare, when viewed from the perspective of public interest, lies well within the provincial domain.
The controversy at hand revolved around a petition instituted by Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd, an entity engaged in the production and sale of cement, with its manufacturing facility located at Hub, Lasbela, Balochistan. The petition challenged a Nov 27, 2023 order of the Balochistan High Court.
Attock Cement’s challenge to BHC verdict dismissed
The petition was initially filed before the Supreme Court but was later transferred to the newly established FCC following the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
On Jan 15, 2021, the factory was served with a notice by the Mines Labour Welfare Department, Balochistan, requiring payment of excise duty on minerals to the Labour Welfare Commissioner, Balochistan, at rates revised pursuant to the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020.
In response, the factory submitted three separate representations to the department, seeking revision of the applicable rates. However, all three representations were declined.
During the hearing before the FCC, counsel for the factory, Khurram M. Hashmi and Noman A. Farooqi, argued that the provincial assembly, by amending Section 3 of the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour Welfare) Act, 1967 through Section 7 of the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020, had acted without legislative competence. They contended that the imposition of excise duty fell within the exclusive federal legislative domain and that the Balochistan Assembly therefore lacked the authority to amend the 1967 Act, particularly where such amendment effectively altered the rate or nature of excise duty.
However, in the judgement, Justice Farooq observed that the objective of the Labour Welfare Act, 1967 was unmistakably oriented towards the advancement of labour welfare, a domain constitutionally entrusted to the provinces.
The mechanism through which this objective is pursued — the imposition of a duty of excise — is not an end in itself but a means carefully designed to finance a broader public interest. The statute, the judgment noted, does not merely levy a tax; rather, it establishes an administrative framework for the collection, allocation and utilisation of the proceeds, all of which are inextricably linked to the welfare of labour employed in the industry.
Thus, while the recovery of excise duty constitutes the operative mechanism of the Act, its spirit, essential character and constitutional essence lie in the realisation of labour welfare. The excise duty, the court held, is instrumental in achieving this predominant provincial objective, rendering the Act, in its true nature, an expression of social welfare legislation rather than mere taxation.
Even if, by a strict reading of the preamble and operative provisions of the 1967 Act, its dominant character were to be construed as the collection and imposition of excise duty, its underlying purpose could not be ignored. Such a conclusion, the court said, merely reveals an overlap between two constitutional competences: the federal authority to levy excise duty and the provincial responsibility to advance labour welfare.
This incidental overlap, the judgment added, does not justify invalidating the statute. Justice Farooq emphasised that the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) of 2010 consciously embraced the ethos of cooperative federalism, wherein legislative fields are not rigid silos but, at times, interacting spheres.
In this constitutional landscape, incidental overlap does not render a statute ultra vires. The court further observed that following the 18th Amendment, the Concur­rent Legislative List was abolished, significantly expanding provincial legislative authority, with matters not explicitly listed in the Federal Legislative List falling within the exclusive domain of the provinces.
The FCC also acknowledged the traditional use of the “pith and substance” doctrine in determining legislative competence, noting that courts have increasingly relied on the “double aspect” doctrine, which permits a single subject to be legislated upon by both federal and provincial governments from different perspectives.
In the end, the FCC denied leave to appeal and dismissed the petition filed by the cement manufacturer.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967966,China’s birth rate falls to lowest on record - Dawn,"BEIJING: China’s birth rate plunged last year to its lowest level on record, official data showed on Monday, as its population shrank for a fourth straight year despite efforts to curb the decline.
It is now threatened with a demographic crisis after its birth rate halved over the past decade, despite the end of the restrictive  “one-child” policy. There were just 7.92 million births recorded last year, Chinese officials said on Monday, a rate of 5.63 births per thousand people.
It was the lowest birth rate since National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) records began in 1949 — the year Communist leader Mao Zedong declared the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
The United Nations has predicted that China’s population could fall from around 1.4 billion today to 800 million by 2100, even though it has taken measures to boost fertility rates. Births fell by 1.62 million in 2025, a drop of 17 percent year-on-year, NBS data showed.
UN predicts population could fall from around 1.4bn to 800m by 2100
China’s population also fell by 3.39 million people last year compared to 2024, extending the annual decline that began in 2022.
The government has scrambled to boost marriage and fertility rates, offering childcare subsidies and taxing condoms as it grapples with a rapidly ageing population.
China also recorded 11.31 million deaths in 2025, a mortality rate of 8.04 per thousand — leading to a population decline of 2.41 per thousand, NBS data showed.
High costs
Marriage rates are also at record low, with many young Chinese couples put off from having babies by high child-rearing costs and career concerns. Many couples born during China’s family planning period — each only children — are now grappling with the responsibility of raising children while caring for two sets of ageing parents.
Authorities have attempted to address the flagging birth rate with a raft of measures intended to promote having children.
A nationwide childcare subsidy policy, which took effect on January 1, offers parents the equivalent of around $500 annually per child under the age of three. Authorities also waived fees for public kindergartens beginning last fall.
And consumers must now pay a 13pc value-added tax for contraception, including condoms, after Beijing removed exemptions from January 1.
Despite government efforts to reverse the trend, China ranked among the top 10 countries with the lowest birth rates in 2023, according to World Bank data, just after Japan. Young Chinese have largely shrugged off these measures, saying they are not enough to address the problem.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968551,Improving exports - Dawn,"PRIME Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s reiteration that Pakistan’s economic future is in “export-led growth” risks remaining political rhetoric in the absence of credible reforms to improve productivity. Speaking in Davos, he noted that our exports are facing a myriad of challenges. But, he added, the way forward is clear: Pakistan has to have export-led growth. The diagnosis is undoubtedly correct. Pakistan’s repeated balance-of-payment crises are rooted in its chronic inability to expand exports and its overdependence on foreign borrowing and remittances. Nonetheless, the statement is a reminder of the complete disconnect between political rhetoric on exports and the absence of a credible plan to achieve this repeatedly stated goal. Successive governments, including the incumbent one, have consistently talked up export-led growth and failed to follow it up with reforms needed to diversify the country’s narrow, low-value exports and improve the competitiveness of the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
The stagnation in exports and sluggish growth in recent years indicate that the economic policy reforms the PM spoke about have fallen well short of addressing the structural weaknesses, or what is required to raise productivity, attract long-term investment and diversify the export base. Indeed, the government has managed to restore a semblance of macroeconomic stability. But this has come at a steep cost to economic growth and export competitiveness. So far, little has been done to fix the inefficient energy sector or to restructure the inequitable tax system. Both continue to impose excessive costs on manufacturers and exporters, erode industrial competitiveness and deter investment in productive sectors. In sum, short-term stabilisation cannot substitute long-term competitiveness if the stated goal is to boost exports for sustained growth. No matter how often the PM and his finance team repeat their favourite refrain about their intentions of redirecting the economy towards export-led growth, it will remain more an empty slogan to placate an economically distressed population than a strategy unless accompanied by a credible productivity reform roadmap.

TEHRAN: Internet access in Iran will “gradually” return to normal this week, a senior official said on Monday, as the government faces internationalfalloutfrom an 11-day communications blackout imposed during deadly anti-government protests.
The announcement came the same day organisers of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, confirmed the Iranian foreign minister would not attend the summit because it would not be “right” following the recent crackdown.
Simultaneously, the United Nations issued a report condemning Tehran for using executions as a “tool of state intimidation”.
“The internet will gradually return to normal operations this week,” Hossein Afshin, Iran’s vice president for science, technology and the knowledge economy, said on Monday on state television.
The government imposed a nationwide communicationsblackoutearlier this month amid huge demonstrations triggered by anger over economic hardship.
Limited internet access briefly returned on Sunday for some foreign websites such as Google, but opening links from search results remained impossible as of Monday.
The shutdown began on Jan 8. Norway-based Iran Human Rights said it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic Republic’s health and medical system, witnesses and independent sources.
The NGO warned the true toll is likely far higher. The media cannot independently confirm the figure, and Iranian officials have not provided an exact death toll.
‘Not right’
Iran’s foreign minister will not be attending the Davos su­­mmit in Switzerland this we­­ek, the organisers said, stressing it would not be “right” after the recent deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran.
Abbas Araghchi had been scheduled to speak on Tuesday during the annual gathering of the global elite at the upscale Swiss ski resort town.
But activists have been calling on the World Economic Forum organisers to disinvite him amid what rights groups have called a “massacre” in his country.
“The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos,” the World Economic Forum said on X.
“Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” it added.
‘Intimidation tool’
Iran appears to be using executions “as a tool of state intimidation”, the United Nations said on Monday, as it denounced a jump in capital punishment globally in 2025.
The Islamic republic reportedly executed 1,500 people last year, UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
“The scale and pace of executions suggest a systematic use of capital punishment as a tool of state intimidation, with disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities and migrants,” he warned.
The spike in executions in Iran — which according to rights groups is the world’s most prolific executioner after China — had contributed to “an alarming increase” in the use of capital punishment worldwide last year, Turk said.
While the overall global trend continues to move towards universal abolition of the death penalty, Iran and a handful of other states such as Saudi Arabia and the United States saw executions surge.
“Many of those executions were “for offences not meeting the ‘most serious crimes’ threshold required under international law,” Turk said, also criticising “the continued execution of people convicted of crimes committed as children, as well as persistent secrecy around executions”.
