This charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship ‘State of the Industry Report 2025’, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.
It said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.
It said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, “overall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development”.
Nepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt
It pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, many go­­vernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com­me­rcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie­ncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con­tribute to the circular debt problem.
It said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. “Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector’s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth”, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector’s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.
The regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.
It appreciated the government’s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. “Consequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs’ tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms”.
On top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal.
Reduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.
A notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.
The regulator put on record that “KE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators”.
Operational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.
It said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.
As if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement drive had “been diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions”. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement efforts.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967628/failed-power-reform,Failed power reform - Dawn,"NEPRA’S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.
In fact, the power sector’s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector’s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector’s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator’s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967414,RLNG price cut by up to 5pc - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Friday notified up to five per cent reduction in the price of regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) at the distribution stage for the current month, mainly due to lower international oil prices.
This is the second consecutive monthly reduction, following around a 6pc decline in December, cumulatively bringing down RLNG prices by more than 11pc over two months. Before this drop, prices had increased by 4.4pc during October and November.
Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, reported distribution-stage system losses of 12.55pc, up from 10.6pc a couple of months earlier. Meanwhile, Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), supplying gas to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported system losses of nearly 9pc at the distribution stage, compared to 7.47pc in October.
According to the notification, the RLNG sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage declined by 4.62pc to $10.41 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for January 2026, from $10.92 per mmBtu in December 2025 and $11.24 in September.
As a result, the sale price at the distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 4.68pc to $11.27 per mmBtu for January, compared to $11.83 in December and $12.24 in November.
On the other hand, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL at the transmission stage decreased by 5.25pc to $8.98 per mmBtu for January, from $9.47 in December, $10.065 in November and $9.86 in September.
The distribution-stage sale price for SSGCL was also reduced by 5.26pc to $10.21 per mmBtu for the current month, compared to $10.77 in December, $11.45 in November and $11.01 in September.
Ogra said the reduction in RLNG prices was due to a decrease in the delivered ex-ship (DES) price. Unaccounted-for gas (UFG) for both companies at the distribution stage had increased two months ago.
Ironically, the RLNG distribution prices of $10.21 per mmBtu for SSGCL and $11.27 for SNGPL are almost $3.3 and $4.25 per mmBtu higher than the average DES price, respectively.
This is mainly because both LNG importers, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL), along with port authorities, charge profit margins on account of retainage at the rate of 3.77pc of the DES price, on top of losses of 8.97pc for SNGPL and 12.55pc for SSGCL.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967807/govt-cites-weather-among-reasons-for-power-outages,Govt cites weather among reasons for power outages - Dawn,"• Leghari says electricity cuts due to fuel mismanagement, transmission constraints, among other causes• Minister contests ‘outdated’ Nepra report, says document should have been shared for ‘fact-checking’• Claims tariff dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 in December 2025
ISLAMABAD: The government on Sun­day conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8–10 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.
Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and ‘mistakes’ in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.
This resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.
The minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.
He said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.
Mr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps — both low recoveries and high losses — were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers’ money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.
The minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.
He said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.
He agreed with the Nepra’s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under ‘take or pay’ or ‘must run’ agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.
‘Without due diligence’
Responding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.
“We have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan’s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,” he said.
The minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.
He also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. “In the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,” he said.
He also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was ‘a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos’. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.
He said the Discos’ recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.
Circular debt
Contesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator’s “understanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising”.
He said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.
Most importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. “K-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric’s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.
The receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,” the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.
Responding to Nepra’s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967028,Power users to continue paying debt surcharge - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday announced that the Rs3.23 per unit debt surcharge on electricity consumers would continue for up to six years as it notified a revised uniform national base tariff for the current year without any change.
In a statement issued on the sidelines of the revised tariff notification for all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, the Power Division said the debt surcharge, currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit, would be withdrawn in five to six years once the circular debt is cleared.
“Once the circular debt is cleared, the debt surcharge currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit will be withdrawn, providing further tariff relief to consumers,” it said, adding that the government had introduced a surplus power package under which industrial and agricultural consumers can avail additional electricity at a concessional rate of Rs22.98 per unit for three years, helping reduce average industrial tariffs.
In addition, a circular debt settlement plan has been launched to eliminate outstanding debt within five to six years.
The Power Division also conceded that the growth of off-grid solar consumption had distorted subsidy requirements, with the number of protected consumers doubling from 11 million in 2021 to 22m recently due to hybrid consumption patterns.
“This has not only strained fiscal resources but has also increased the cross-subsidy burden on industrial and commercial users, undermining their competitiveness,” it said, adding that commercial, bulk supply and high-consuming domestic consumers were currently bearing a significantly higher cross-subsidy burden than the industrial sector.
Responding to criticism over higher energy costs — alsohighlightedby Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as one of the key reasons for the exit of foreign firms from Pakistan and export challenges — the Power Division said it would explore additional options to further reduce the cross-subsidy burden on industrial consumers, including subsidy reforms and debt refinancing, in addition to the tariff reduction measures already in place.
It added that data showed the industrial cross-subsidy burden had been reduced from Rs225 billion (Rs8.9 per unit) in March 2024, when the current government assumed office, to Rs102bn (Rs4.02 per unit) at present, reflecting a reduction of Rs123bn.
“Industrial electricity tariffs (including taxes) have declined from Rs62.99 per unit in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per unit in December 2025, while the national average tariff has fallen from Rs53.04 to Rs42.27 per unit,” it said.
Moreover, to reduce electricity tariffs, the government has terminated inefficient power plants and successfully renegotiated contracts with independent power producers (IPPs). These measures have resulted in tariff reductions, and further negotiations with the remaining IPPs are underway, the Power Division said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1966540,Pakistan’s struggle to scale its exports - Dawn,"For nearly two decades, Pakistan’s exports have remained stuck between $25–30 billion, despite repeated declarations that export-led growth is central to economic revival. Over the same period, Bangladesh has crossed $50bn, while Vietnam now exceeds $350bn. This widening gap is not the result of global shocks or bad luck. It reflects domestic policy choices that have made exporting costly, uncertain, and unrewarding — while protecting inefficiency at home.
Macroeconomic instability as a built-in disadvantage
Successful exporters require stable costs and predictable policy. Pakistan offers neither. Recurrent balance-of-payments crises trigger abrupt stabilisation programmes, policy reversals, and stop-start incentives.
Exchange-rate management has been particularly damaging. Periodic overvaluation to contain inflation acts as a hidden tax on exports, eroding competitiveness. When corrections eventually occur, they are sharp and disruptive, driving up input costs and debt servicing. Exporters are forced to operate in an environment where profitability can disappear overnight.
Exporters taxed as revenue sources
Pakistan’s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed. This effectively turns exporters into involuntary lenders to the state, tying up working capital and raising borrowing costs. Smaller and mid-sized exporters — essential for diversification — are hit hardest.
In competing economies, exports are genuinely zero-rated, with automated refunds and minimal compliance burdens. In Pakistan, exporters are taxed first and refunded later — if at all — despite already having to self-provide basic infrastructure, security, and logistics. This fiscal approach treats exports as a short-term revenue stream rather than a long-term growth strategy.
Energy costs that destroy competitiveness
High and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation. Penalising captive power to force grid usage has reduced industrial flexibility while merely shifting circular debt from electricity to gas. Given Pakistan’s concentration in low value-added exports, where energy is a large cost component, this disadvantage is decisive.
Low value-added exports
Pakistan’s export base remains narrow and low value. Textiles dominate, but largely at the yarn, fabric, and basic garment level — segments with thin margins and intense competition. Some firms have exited higher value-added apparel altogether, whilst others are contemplating relocating production abroad. By contrast, Bangladesh invested in scale, compliance, and female labour participation to move up the garment value chain, while Vietnam diversified into electronics, engineering, and services.
Global demand is also shifting away fromcottontoward man-made fibres, weakening Pakistan’s traditional advantage. Without deliberate upgrading, innovation, and branding, export diversification will remain elusive — even as Pakistan’s land, water, and human capital offer opportunities in horticulture, livestock, dairy, seafood, minerals, information technology, and professional services.
Weak standards
Food and agricultural exports face persistent quality and hygiene challenges. Inadequate domestic testing facilities force exporters to rely on foreign laboratories, raising costs and delays. Training and certification infrastructure remain underdeveloped. While exporters are allowed to open overseas marketing offices, funding limits are too low to support brand development or to secure shelf space. As a result, Pakistani brands have minimal global presence outside diaspora markets.
Protectionism that rewards inefficiency
High tariffs and ad-hoc import restrictions raise input costs and disrupt supply chains. Recent changes under the Export FacilitationScheme— denying refunds on certain imported inputs — further penalise exporters.
Protection has encouraged firms to prioritise secure domestic margins over global competitiveness. Medium-sized exporters, lacking inventory buffers, suffer most. Domestic consumers pay higher prices for lower-quality goods, while protected firms rarely evolve into serious exporters.
Productivity and skills gaps
No incentive can compensate for low productivity. Pakistani firms face unreliable energy, inefficient logistics, and shortages of technical, managerial, and digital skills. While Vietnam benefits from a disciplined workforce and Bangladesh from broad labour participation, Pakistan continues to underinvest in human capital limiting its ability to upgrade exports.
Policy inconsistency and weak credibility
Perhaps the most damaging constraint is policy credibility. Export policies are announced without consultation, applied unevenly, and reversed under fiscal pressure. Temporary incentives and shifting rules discourage long-term investment. Export growth requires confidence that policies will endure beyond the next crisis.
Both the government and businesses must change
While policy failures dominate, the private sector also bears responsibility. Too many firms focus on lobbying for protection rather than investing in competitiveness, innovation, and new markets. Despite duty-free access to the European Union and UK, Pakistan’s textile market share has stagnated, while China and Vietnam, despite tariffs, have expanded through superior cost, quality, and reliability.
Pakistan will not scale exports through episodic devaluations, temporary incentives, or punitive taxation disguised as reform. What is needed is macroeconomic stability, a predictable and competitive exchange rate, affordable energy, rationalised tariffs, a truly zero-rated export regime with automatic refunds, and sustained investment in skills. Until exports are treated as central to economic survival rather than a revenue afterthought, ambitious targets — such as $63bn — will remain out of reach.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1965589,Government mulls fuel levy hike to aid gas sector - Dawn,"• Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months• Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector
ISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
While testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr­o­leum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.
The minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.
Interestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared topetrol and dieselwhich are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.
In the last week of November 2025, Ogra haddeterminedup to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra’s determination within 40 days.
The minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan hadconcludedsuccessful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac­h­ed to manage excess supplies.
MNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector’s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.
The minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been “quelled”, which was a critical reform measure.
Sui gas companies’ managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.
Committee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.
Officials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.
No domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.
The committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.
The minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.
The committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967505,Search operation begins to locate over 50 missing people at Karachi’s Gul Plaza as fire doused after 24 hours - Dawn,"KARACHI: A search operation at Karachi’s Gul Plaza began after 10pm on Sunday evening as fire crews were finally able to douse the fire after 24 hours, with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah saying that six deaths have been confirmed, but over 50 people were reportedly missing.
According to Rescue 1122 officials, their teams had finally managed to enter the charred building to launch a search for survivors and bodies as the cooling process was still underway.
The fire, which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road, had been brought under control by about 70 per cent by late Sunday afternoon, officials said.
Speaking to the media at around 7pm, CM Murad said, “I say with utmost grief that so far, it is confirmed that six people have lost their lives, including KMC firefighter Furqan Shaukat.”
He added that 22 others were hurt and had now been discharged from hospitals as they had faced minor injuries.
“But what is very concerning […] is that around 58 people — some people even say more than 60 — are missing. May God give them more life.”
According to a list shared withDawnaround the same time, the South district office had received reports of 53 missing people from their families so far.
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
A separate statement by the South Zone police also listed the following helpline contact numbers: 021-99205670, 021-99201196 and 021-99205691.
Hundreds of people had gathered around the building today, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.
During his media talk, CM Murad noted that the mall was a three-storey building with a basement and housed more than 1,000 shops.
While the chief minister noted that the cause of the fire could not be ascertained for sure at this stage, he said a short circuit was being blamed for igniting the blaze in a shop with flammable material.
Terming it a “very upsetting” incident, he stressed that authorities were making efforts to find missing people.
The Sindh CM detailed that around 26 fire tenders, 10 bowsers and multiple snorkels took part in the fire extinguishing operations.
CM Murad, citing what he had been informed, said an alert about the fire was received at 10:16pm, and the first fire tender had reached the site at 10:27pm.
“All municipal authorities acted immediately, according to what I have been informed, and all these things will be verified.”
President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday spoke CM Murad over the telephone to inquire about the latest situation of the fire, stressing the need to use all available resources to ensure the success of rescue and firefighting operations, a statement from the President’s House said.
“The president also paid tribute to firefighter Farqan Shaukat, who lost his life in the blaze, and asked the Sindh government to nominate him for a civil award.”
He directed authorities to ensure proper medical care for the injured and take immediate steps for the rehabilitation of affected families, while emphasising strict enforcement of fire safety laws and the modernisation of safety inspection mechanisms in commercial and residential buildings to prevent similar incidents in the future.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said PM Shehbaz Sharif also inquired about the incident over the phone, offering all kinds of assistance to the provincial government from the Centre.
Pointing out that the mall was constructed in the 1980s, he said, “I admit that we could not control the deterioration that, without any study, multi-level buildings were allowed. And now if we stop them, the builders make a fuss that they are being bothered.”
He highlighted that many buildings do not have materials to extinguish fire available inside the buildings, and stressed the need for fire exits to be properly marked.
At around 4pm, South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso toldDawnthat the fire had been brought under control by up to 70pc.
Speaking toGeo News, DC Khoso said authorities were gathering information about the number of people trapped inside the building.
“We have cordoned off the area and are trying to extinguish the blazes phase-wise,” he said.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Abid Jalal toldGeo Newsin the afternoon that “firefighting is underway from all three sides”.
He also said that the fire had been brought under control by about 70-75pc. However, he stressed that the building was very dilapidated.
“The backside has collapsed, and the front area is also about to collapse.”
Terming flammable material inside the mall as the “biggest challenge” in fully dousing the blaze, COO Jalal pointed out that accessing the building was very difficult.
“Sending firefighters inside right now is not without danger,” the rescue officer said. Therefore, he added, the team’s strategy was to control the fire first and then begin the search once they were able to enter the mall.
COO Jalal detailed that over 125 people, including firefighters, were engaged in the ongoing operations and about 20-22 vehicles of the fire brigade were involved.
ADawnNewsTVcorrespondent present at the site reported that all sides of the mall had been impacted, with one having “completely collapsed”.
He added that several people had come to look for their relatives, including shopkeepers working at the mall.
Delhi Colony residents Mansoor and Jameel toldDawnNewsTVthat they were unable to contact six of their family members who had come to Gul Plaza last night for shopping.
They said their last contact was at around 10:10pm last night, after which their mobile numbers were not reachable. The missing members comprised three women, two men and a 14-year-old girl.
Speaking to the media at the site in the afternoon, Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad said the search for missing people will begin after the fire has been put out and the cooling process has been completed.
“There were goods such as crockery, clothes, electrical appliances, cosmetics and perfumes in various shops, due to which the fire intensified,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan explained.
The spokesperson added that on Sunday morning, 20 fire tenders from different departments and institutions were being employed to extinguish the blaze.
“But the building appears very old, and there is a danger that its structure may fall at any time because of the impact of the fire. Thus, the rescue operation is being carried out with extreme caution,” he said.
“When we arrived, the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames,” Khan toldReuters.
A Rescue 1122 spokesperson toldBBC Urduearly on Sunday that the fire “spread over 8,000 square yards is very intense and the process to extinguish it [fully] could take one to two days”.
Earlier in the day, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed also confirmed that six bodies and 11 injured had been brought to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) so far. State-runAPPreported that an emergency has been declared at the hospital.
In a statement run byAPP, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said “more than 17 people” had been taken to hospitals due to suffocation, several of whom were discharged after receiving medical treatment.
Noting that Gul Plaza was an old building, he said the final cause of the fire will only be known after the completion of investigations. He added that 40 snorkels were taking part in the operation.
A firefighter identified as Furqan Shoukat also lost his life during the fire-extinguishing efforts, according to a statement by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
“In this time of grief, we stand with the family of martyred Furqan and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation will provide full support to its martyred employees,” the mayor was quoted as saying byAPP.
He said teams and machinery are fully engaged in extinguishing the fire.
In a separate statement, Wahab said all municipal departments have been directed to provide full support to the victims.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate statement reported by state-runRadio Pakistan, also expressed sorrow over the firefighter’s death.
He highlighted that Furqan sacrificed his life while saving the public, and prayed for his elevated ranks.
“It appears to have been caused by a circuit breaker,” Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho told reporters at the site, noting that Gul Plaza housed around 1,200 shops and also had a basement.
“The layout and construction of this market was such, and secondly, the nature of the items in it — such as carpets, blankets and other objects made of resins — so the fire is still simmering because of these.”
Garden Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Mohsin Raza also said in a statement on Saturday night that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit at one of the shops, before spreading to the entire mall.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed officials to divert traffic in the area to alternative routes for the safe passage of citizens.
In a statement, he said that the cause of the fire should be ascertained through a thorough investigation. He said that the building should be secured so that the fire does not spread.
The minister said the routes should be cleared so that fire brigade vehicles could access the scene.
A Sindh Rangers spokesperson said in a statement that personnel had been deployed to the scene of the incident.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in rescue activities and rescue operations along with the fire brigade staff,” the statement, which was issued shortly after the fire erupted, said. “Officers and personnel will remain at the scene until the rescue operation is completed.”
The statement further read that in addition to aiding in rescue operations, a contingent of Rangers had been deployed to cordon off the building for the safety of civilians and to ensure traffic flow.
“Alongside fire tenders, Rangers personnel are evacuating trapped people and ensuring the safety of valuables,” the statement read, adding that protecting lives and preventing the fire from further spreading was a top priority.
Traders feared huge losses as their goods were reduced to ashes by the blaze.
While the estimates vary, the All City Traders Ittehad Association (ACTIA) estimated losses worth around Rs2-2.5 billion, including “repair and reconstruction costs”.
In a statement, ACTIA patron-in-chief Sharjeel Goplani said chairman Zahid Amin and other members of the association had conducted an assessment of the affected mall.
Addressing the Sindh government and the prime minister, Goplani said, “Currently, 1,200 traders have suffered losses. This should be compensated immediately.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz expressed their deep grief over the fire at Gul Plaza and the resulting loss of lives.
In a statement reported byAPP, the premier instructed that all possible assistance should be provided to the affected traders and other individuals, and that all necessary facilities should be provided to the injured.
He stressed that all relevant departments should work together in the rescue operation.
In his statement, President Zardari directed that the Sindh government — which is of his PPP — and the relevant authorities “provide immediate and every possible assistance to the affected people and the traders”.
“No stone should be left unturned in providing the best medical facilities to the injured,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Memon, in a statement reported byAPP, said the Sindh government will decide the future course of action after a complete assessment of the losses.
The minister said that whether it is the trader community or other affected individuals, the government will make every effort to provide maximum possible assistance within the framework of law and regulations.
Taking notice of the incident, CM Murad issued orders to Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi for an immediate inquiry into the matter and to prepare a report on the cause of the fire.
CM Murad was briefed about the incident earlier in the day at the CM House by Commissioner Naqvi and DC Khoso, who informed him that the fire broke out between 9:45pm and 10:15pm.
“The fire safety arrangements in the building should be inspected,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement.
He ordered the strict implementation of fire safety rules and action against those whose negligence or carelessness would be proven.
“A fire safety audit should immediately be conducted of Karachi’s commercial buildings,” CM Murad said.
According to the briefing, more than 1,200 shops were gutted in the incident. A massive emergency response was launched, involving 22 fire brigade vehicles, 10 water bowzers, four snorkel vehicles, and 33 Rescue 1122 ambulances.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed CM Murad and Wahab to deploy all resources to control the fire.
Expressing grief over the loss of lives and property, he demanded an immediate probe into the blaze and ordered that steps be taken to prevent such future tragedies.
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah visited the site of the incident earlier in the day to assess the rescue operations.
The South deputy commissioner and Rescue 1122 officials briefed him on the steps taken to control the fire.
The chief secretary issued orders for the deployment of all available fire tenders and additional rescue workers.
Soon after the fire began, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had also visited Gul Plaza, where he was briefed on the rescue and relief operations.
Standing alongside the traders whose shops were ablaze, the governor issued directives for the rehabilitation of the affected.
Prior to his visit, in a statement from his office, Tessori expressed concern over the incident and ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations.
He also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.
Gul Plaza has witnessed fire incidents in the past as well.
InAugust 2016, more than 25 shops were burnt in a huge fire that broke out in the multi-storey market. It was believed that a short circuit caused the fire.
A fire at a warehouse in Gul Plaza inAugust 2008, also caused by an electric short-circuit, destroyed some goods. However, no casualty was reported.
Fires frequentlyeruptin buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
At a conference in October 2025 followingmultiplefireincidents, city planners, fire experts and disaster management authorities raisedserious concernsover the deteriorating state of fire preparedness in Karachi.
They urged authorities to take immediate action to align the metropolis’s fire safety systems with international standards, warning that the current state leaves the city dangerously exposed to large-scale emergencies.
In December, the Sindh Assemblyvoted unanimouslyin favour of an opposition-sponsored resolution that called for the comprehensive modernisation of Karachi’s inadequate and substandard firefighting system.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967111,"Explainer: Iran’s economy faces rocky road amid rising prices, falling currency - Dawn","Iran’s economy is going through one of its most difficult periods in years, fueled by sanctions, high inflation, and a significant drop in the value of the national currency, the rial.
These pressures have had a direct impact on living standards and have also fueled recent protests.
The protests began on Dec. 28 in commercial hubs in the capital Tehran, when shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners staged strikes and demonstrations to protest soaring inflation, the collapsing rial, and deteriorating economic conditions, and have since grown into nationwide anti-government expressions of discontent involving workers, students, and others across multiple cities.
The Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran’s economic problems amid the protests. Masoud Pezeshkian said the government admits to “shortcomings and problems” and is working hard to alleviate the people’s concerns, especially on the economy.
The Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. It started last year at around 817,000 rials per $1, then sank to 1.42-1.47 million rials on the parallel market by late 2025.
Due to the rial’s sharp decline, most Iranians have struggled to keep up with steadily rising prices.
The currency has been suffering for years in the face of sanctions and inflationary pressures, going from about 34,000 rials to the US dollar in 2016 to around 270,000 in 2021 and some 430,000 in 2022.
By 2023-2024, the rial had crossed the 750,000 mark on the open market, and its depreciation accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the rial has lost nearly 800 per cent of its value, and as of this week, it trades at around 1.5 million rials to the dollar, severely eroding household purchasing power.
As the rial weakened, import costs shot up, feeding inflation and forcing businesses to raise prices. For ordinary Iranians, the falling currency has wiped out savings, reduced purchasing power, and created fear that prices will continue rising.
Traders and shopkeepers have been among the first to protest, as they struggle to afford goods amid daily currency swings.
Inflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Middle- and lower-income families are increasingly forced to cut back on basic goods.
Consumer price inflation remains exceptionally high, with inflation estimated at 30.6pc in 2020 before rising sharply to 43.4pc in 2021 and staying elevated at around 44pc–46pc in both 2022 and 2023.
Although inflation eased to about 32.5pc in 2024, it is projected to accelerate again, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting inflation of 42.4pc in 2025 and remaining above 40pc in 2026, underscoring the persistence of price pressures driven by currency weakness and structural constraints.
Food costs and staples have grown much faster, with sectoral inflation (such as bread and fruit) substantially outpacing the national rate.
The Statistical Centre of Iran reported that food inflation last September reached 58pc, more than double the rate in the same month the previous year. According to the survey, fruit costs have soared 75pc while bread and grains, which are staples in Iranian households, have almost doubled in price.
Although the government provides cash handouts and subsidies, including monthly payments, and food staple, electricity, and foreign exchange subsidies, these measures have not offset the impact of rising prices, especially as the value of payments declines alongside the rial.
Iran’s economy is still severely hampered by international sanctions. US sanctions limit access to the international financial system, banking transactions, and oil exports. Even when Iran is successful in exporting oil, access to hard currency is often restricted, delayed, or held overseas.
According to aReuterssurvey, Iran’s oil output fell by 100,000 barrels per day in late 2025 due to the sanctions, which directly cut into government revenue.
Total exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, while imports are expected to fall by roughly 10pc to $98bn, according to the IMF, reflecting tighter foreign exchange and sanctions pressure.
In 2025, the IMF projected a 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) decline in both output and exports as of last May. A greater decline of up to half a million bpd has been projected by independent energy analytics companies, including Kpler, Vortexa, and TankerTrackers.
As a result, foreign exchange inflows have fallen, and the Central Bank’s capacity to maintain currency stability has been eroded. Additionally, sanctions have hindered trade and discouraged foreign investment, pushing Iran to rely on unofficial routes that raise prices and decrease transparency.
Iran’s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. In the fiscal year that ended last March, Iran’s Central Bank estimated oil revenues of $67bn. The bank reported oil revenues of $56bn for fiscal 2024, $55bn for 2023, $38bn for 2022, and $23bn for 2021.
However, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the export figures vary. In the calendar year 2018, when the first Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran, oil revenues reached $51bn, according to the EIA. In 2020, they sank to $5bn, before rebounding to $43bn in 2024.
Iran’s fiscal position remains under strain, with the government running persistent budget deficits amid constrained revenues and rising spending pressures.
According to IMF-based estimates, the budget deficit stood at around 4.1pc of GDP in 2024 and is expected to widen to about 6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, before remaining elevated at roughly 6.2pc of GDP in 2026. The deterioration reflects limited oil revenue recovery under sanctions, weak non-oil tax collection, and higher outlays on subsidies, wages, and social support, adding to inflationary and currency pressures.
In its most recent budget, the government estimated daily oil shipments of 1.85 million barrels per day at $67 per barrel. However, the IMF projected that actual exports would only average 1.1 million barrels per day, showing a significant deficit.
Over the last five years, Iran’s economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown.
After a period of lost growth in the late 2010s, GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022, largely driven by a recovery in oil exports and domestic services following the pandemic. This momentum peaked in 2023 with a 5.3pc expansion, but the trajectory has since cooled considerably.
By 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 from the IMF and the World Bank suggest a near-stagnant rate of just 0.3pc to 0.6pc. This recent deceleration is attributed to intensified sanctions, chronic inflation (averaging near 40pc), and severe energy shortages that have hampered industrial productivity.
While the oil sector remains a primary driver of the nominal economy — which fluctuated between $350bn and $475bn — non-oil sectors continue to struggle under structural constraints and a weakening currency.
In addition, the labour market over the last five years has been characterised by a jobless recovery followed by a tightening market amid recent economic stagnation. Official figures showed the total unemployment rate declining from 9.3pc in 2021 to a record low of approximately 7.2pc to 8.2pc by late 2024.
Youth unemployment remains a critical challenge, consistently hovering between 20pc and 23pc, nearly triple the national average.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967040/scientists-recover-genome-from-woolly-rhino-eaten-by-ice-age-wolf,Scientists recover genome from woolly rhino eaten by Ice Age wolf - Dawn,"ABOUT 14,400 years ago, a weeks-old wolf puppy ate its last meal — meat from a woolly rhinoceros — shortly before dying on the harsh Ice Age landscape of northeastern Siberia.
In a first, researchers have extracted DNA and recovered the rhino’s genome from a chunk of undigested meat from the stomach contents found in the puppy’s remains, discovered in permafrost near the village of Tumat. These genome findings provided insight into the fate of this impressive cold-adapted horned herbivore species once common in northern Europe and Asia.
The researchers compared this rhino’s genome to those of two other individuals from the same species that lived thousands of years earlier — about 18,000 and 49,000 years ago — to examine genetic changes over time. In doing so, they learned that the woolly rhinoceros as a species remained genetically healthy until the end of the Ice Age before apparently suffering a rapid population collapse, probably because the warming climate erased their preferred steppe-tundra environment.
For instance, the newly recovered genome showed no evidence of inbreeding suggestive of population decline. Other research has indicated that the woolly rhinoceros disappeared about 14,000 years ago, just a few hundred years after this individual lived.
“With this research we demonstrate that it is possible to recover a high-quality genome from poorly preserved material dating to a crucial time in the life history of a species,” said evolutionary geneticist Solveig Gudjonsdottir, lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution.
“It is a very cool achievement,” said evolutionary geneticist and study co-senior author Love Daln of the Centre for Palaeogenetics, a collaboration between Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The woolly rhinoceros, whose species name is Coelodonta antiquitatis, first appears in the fossil record about 600,000 years ago.
It became one of the many large mammals to go extinct around the end of the last Ice Age, along with such species as woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, mastodons and giant ground sloths, all of which faced ominous environmental changes as the climate warmed, as well as pressure from human hunting.
“The woolly rhinoceros was a large animal, reaching up to around 2 meters (7 feet) tall, and was covered in thick, long fur,” said Gudjonsdottir, who worked on the study while a master’s student at Stockholm University. “It had two horns, a large hump on its back, a stocky build and relatively short legs. The species was primarily a grazer, feeding on grass and low vegetation adapted to cold, dry environments,” Gudjonsdottir added.

According to CTD officials, the suspect, identified as Mujtaba, was arrested during an intelligence-based operation in the provincial capital. A large quantity of explosives, along with maps of important buildings, was recovered from his possession. The department said the recovery indicated planning to target sensitive installations in multiple cities.
In a statement, the CTD spokesperson said the department carried out 425 intelligence-based operations across Punjab to pre-empt potential terrorist activity. During these operations, 427 suspects were questioned and 49 individuals were arrested for alleged involvement in terrorism-related activities. Weapons, explosives and other prohibited material were also seized, the spokesperson said.
The arrested suspects include Shaukat, Naveed, Abdul Rehman, Amjad, Shahid, Abrar, Danish Khan, Khalil Ahmed, Jamil-ur-Rehman, Ehsanullah, Nader, Waqas, Hasnain, Farooq, Jamshed and Awlad Khan, among others. CTD said the suspects were linked to Fitna-ul-Khawarij and other banned organisations.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967278,Difficult times - Dawn,"IQBAL works as a driver with a rent-a-car company. He is usually working six to seven days a week. The company pays him around Rs30,000 as salary. He does make some more as overtime, and though that amount varies by the month, on average he gets another Rs20,000 or so. Adding tips to the total, he makes around Rs65,000 per month. He has a wife and two children who are still in school.
Up to a couple of years ago, Iqbal was able to save a bit every month from his income. But the inflation over the last few years has made his budget a lot more constrained. He is barely able to meet all his routine expenses now. Electricity and gas bills have increased a lot. And the food bill has also almost doubled. He is actively on the lookout for extra driving jobs now so that he can get more overtime payment. He has started skipping lunch unless a client is generous enough to give him lunch or money for lunch.
This is not an isolated case. In their article (‘People are eating less’) in this paper last week, Zafar Mirza and Miftah Ismail, giving numbers from the Household Integrated Expenditure Survey 2024-25, have shown that people are indeed eating less and they have had to tighten their belts further to make ends meet. And this is true for not just lower-income groups but middle-income groups as well.
What has made life a lot harder for Iqbal and his family has been a health shock. His wife has blood pressure and diabetes and has recently been diagnosed with some liver ailment. Doctor’s fee, expenses for diagnostic testing and regular costs of medicines have pushed Iqbal into debt. He has been forced to borrow from his relatives, friends and any clients he felt would be kind enough to help him or lend him money.
We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generation opportunities.
Each month is a struggle now. Medical expenses are a constant addition to his monthly expenses, but his income has not gone up and there does not seem to be any prospect of income growth either. He has essentially fallen into a debt trap. He has accumulated a significant amount of debt, which there is little possibility of paying, and has no ability to raise further debt. But monthly expenses continue to be higher than his income.
What is a person like Iqbal supposed to do?
This is not the story of just one household in Pakistan. It is the story of a significant proportion of the population of the country. If people have no savings, shocks can be devastating and can push households into debt and poverty. The most common shock seems to be health shocks. For a household of five to six people — the norm in Pakistan — with one or two earners, and with grandparents and children, health shocks are not a surprise at all.
Diabetes, blood pressure, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and many other ailments — a lot of them requiring medium- to long-term and continued care — are quite common in Pakistan. With 40 per cent or so of children afflicted with malnutrition, youngsters falling ill is not unexpected either.
The state does not provide good healthcare facilities. Public sector provision is not only patchy and of poor quality in general, it is also not available everywhere. And private healthcare is expensive. Whenever Iqbal has taken his wife to the public hospital, he has been told to get diagnostic tests done from private laboratories and he has also had to pay for all the medicines. Only the doctor’s fee is subsidised by the state. But diagnostic tests are quite expensive. Medicines, too, are expensive and have become even more costly over the last few years.
Do bear in mind that we do not provide any income support through our social protection institutions and programmes to those who are above very low-income levels. The Benazir Income Support Programme is for the very poor and does not extend beyond. There are no programmes for the working or low-income poor.
What could be the way out for Iqbal? Can he increase his income? He could try to work more hours. That is not easy though. He could pull out one or more of his children from school and push them into the workforce. But given the unemployment rates in the country, this is not much of an option, especially if the children are still in the early to middle stages of their education. And the loss in terms of a child not completing his or her education is seen in the medium- to long-term damage to the country.
It is at the level of the state that we can actually change things. In fact, it is the responsibility of the state to do so. A large proportion of Pakistanis have fallen on hard times, even a larger proportion has become more vulnerable to shocks than before. It is the responsibility of the state to do something about this. It is here, even in terms of intentions, that we do not find anything. We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generating opportunities for people. And we need to think about extending support to those who are falling on hard times. Probably the best way to do this — and this is being done and has been done in many countries — is to extend health and education facilities of decent quality to all citizens, especially those who are struggling. This could help a lot of people in major ways. But, of course, in an elitist and elite-captured state, this will not happen easily. It will require a major overhaul of the governance system and governance ethos in the country. This, at least for now, does not seem to be on the horizon.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967046/32-killed-after-crane-falls-on-train-in-thailand,32 killed after crane falls on train in Thailand - Dawn,"
SIKHIO: A train derailed in northeastern Thailand on Wednesday after a construction crane fell on two of its carriages, killing at least 32 people and injuring 66, the regional governor said.
The accident occurred in the Sikhio district of Nakhon Ratchasima province, 230km northeast of Bangkok, on a train from the capital bound for Ubon Ratchathani province.
Transport Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said in a statement there were 195 people aboard the train, adding that he had ordered a thorough investigation. The crane was working on a high-speed rail project when it collapsed and hit the passing train, causing it to derail and briefly catch fire.
Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told the State Railway of Thailand to provide good compensation for families of the dead, adding in comments to reporters after being briefed at the scene: “We need to investigate... and take legal action.” The Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited , which was contracted to build the rail segment, expressed regret for the accident and said it would provide compensation and relief to families of the casualties.
In March last year, a 30-storey building under construction in Bangkok by a joint venture including ITD collapsed, killing 89 people, after an 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck neighbouring Myanmar.
ITD President Premchai Karnasuta was indicted in August along with 22 others on allegations of negligence and breaching construction regulations. The executive and 14 others denied wrongdoing when they were first arrested in May.
Smoke billows from wreckage
Images shared by the ministry showed train carriages overturned next to shrubland and firefighters extinguishing a blaze as smoke billowed out. Earlier footage of the crash site showed rescue workers trying to extract casualties from one of the mangled carriages, with some badly injured passengers already being loaded into ambulances.
The elevated high-speed rail project, one of several under construction in Thailand, was being built above the existing rail line. Part of the collapsed crane is still propped up by the concrete stanchions built to support the new rail link, with debris dangling over the tracks below.
The construction is part of the Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima segment of the transnational high-speed rail project linking the Thai capital with the southwest Chinese city of Kunming.
Recovery operations at the accident scene continued into Wednesday evening with Anutin saying the track needed to be cleared by the end of the week. He noted that this was a major rail route and delays would hurt the regional economy.
High-speed link
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the Beijing government attached great importance to the safety of projects and personnel in Thailand and was looking into the situation.
“At present, it seems that the relevant section was under construction by a Thai enterprise. The cause of the accident is still under investigation.” The cross-country high-speed rail project will connect to China through Laos. The government said last year that more than a third of construction had been completed in the segment connecting Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima, with the whole line to Nong Khai at the border with Laos ready by 2030.

Thefire, which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road, was finally doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday. A search operation was initiated amid fears of further casualties. Officials initially suspected an electrical short circuit, but said the cause has yet to be confirmed.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said they had managed to control the flames by upto 95 per cent, and the cooling phase has been initiated.
“The cause of the fire is still unknown,” he noted. Officials have said it was believed that a short-circuit sparked the blaze.
South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khosa had also said the cooling process was ongoing.
Earlier in the day, Fire Officer Zafar Khan stated that 90pc of the blaze had been brought under control, although “flames are still present in the inner market”.
“The building’s front and back façades have collapsed, and there are many cracks on the inside as well. So it is extremely dangerous,” Zafar said, adding that rescue teams were conducting “short-term operations” at some spots where they suspected bodies were present.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Dr Abid Jalal said that firefighting efforts restarted from the Rimpa Plaza side, as flames continue to emerge from the smouldering debris.
According to South DIG Syed Asad Raza, 15 bodies have been recovered so far by rescue personnel from the now-gutted shopping plaza.
“Samples of eight family members [have been] collected for DNA matching,” he said.
“Fire safety operation has been completed. Cooling process has now started with the removal of debris from the site by KMC, TMC and Pakistan Navy personnel,” said the DIG.
According to DIG Raza, the shopping plaza had a total of 16 gates — 13 on the ground floor and three in the basement — out of which only two gates were open on the ground, while one exit was open in the basement.
Separately, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed toldDawnthat five bodies were brought to the Civil Hospital Karachi.
Separately, in a meeting with representatives of the traders’ community, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah vowed to immediately rehabilitate the affected businesses.
“We will reconstruct the building of Gul Plaza,” he announced, according to a statement from his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.
The chief minister also formed a committee that would make recommendations regarding the businesses’ rehabilitation and affectees’ compensation.
“The Sindh government will have a forensic report conducted so the cause of the fire could be known.
Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi informed the meeting that the death toll could surge to over 50. CM Murad, after being told that the cooling process was underway, ordered that the work to clear the rubble be initiated right away.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab briefed the chief minister that 16 fire tenders and bowsers were involved in the dousing operations, in which “50 to 60” firefighters participated.
He further said that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) had provided tankers and 431,000 gallons of water for the fire-extinguishing operations.
CM’s aide Giyan Chand Essarani informed the meeting that the blaze erupted at 10:36pm on January 17, adding that Rescue 1122 ambulances reached the site within six minutes.
He further said that a total of 24 fire rescue vehicles took part in the operations, including those of KMC and the Pakistan Navy.
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
Gul Plaza Traders Association President Tanveer Pasta said over 40 shopkeepers and salespersons were among those missing in the wake of the incident.
Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, told the media that “more than 70 people” remained missing. DIG Raza stated the same figure.
“The reports of more than 70 missing persons are extremely alarming and constitute a major tragedy,” said the governor, adding that the incident has now “turned into a national tragedy”.
“Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said.
He further stated that while determining the cause of the fire is necessary, the priority for now is to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders.
Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated.
“My cousin was inside,” said Raheel Ibrahim about Naveed Juma, who he said used to work at a shop on Gul Plaza’s first floor.
“His phone was ringing till 12am [on Saturday] but he did not receive calls,” he said, adding that his cousin’s phone was unreachable afterwards.
“Till now there is no news of him,” Ibrahim said, adding that his 43-year-old cousin had three young daughters.
Another elderly man from the Metroville area said his daughter, daughter-in-law and sister had come to the mall for shopping on Saturday.
“We have had no contact with them after 8pm that night,” he added.
The distraught man lamented, “Wherever we go, they push us away like a football that ‘ask so and so, we do not know anything’.”
Noting that some bodies were unidentifiable and needed DNA samples for cross-matching, the man said he was being told that details about that process would take two to three days.
In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza.
The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower.
Commuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or Mazar-i-Quaid from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal Market, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road.
United Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriot said she was “heartbroken” by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza.
“May strength be with the community at this time,” she said.
The German Consulate in Karachi, in a post on X, said the incident at Gul Plaza was deeply saddening. “Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, and those injured.”
The French embassy in Pakistan expressed “profound sorrow over the loss of many lives in the devastating fire”.
“We offer our sincere condolences to the bereaved families and stand with the people of Pakistan in this moment of grief,” the embassy said on X.
The terrifyingfirethat erupted at Gul Plaza on Saturday night could have been contained sooner, but thedelayed responseand limited resources from the authorities allowed the blaze to rage unchecked for hours.
Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.
Shopkeepers at the site toldDawnthat if the firefighting team had arrived with full force and resources, the scene would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.
A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.

A two-judge constitutional bench, headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed, also put a federal law officer on notice for Jan 20 and directed the respondents to file comments by the next hearing.
Citing the power ministry, Nepra and KE as respondents, petitioner Usama Ahmed Usmani submitted that he, along with his family, lived at Data Nagar in Orangi Town and had regularly been paying his electricity bills.
He said the KE categorised him as a “star customer”. However, he said the utility had on Jan 13 illegally disconnected the power supply of the entire area from a pole-mounted transformer (PMT) by declaring the area as “high loss zone”.
He maintained that like him many other consumers were also paying their power bills on a regular basis, but the entire locality was punished by the tility.
KE policy to punish entire locality due to default of a few individuals is violation of Nepra Act, articles 4 and 25 of Constitution, SHC told
The petitioner, who is also a SHC staffer, argued that the Consumer Service Manual 2021 approved by Nepra had only authorised the KE to disconnect the power supply of a defaulting customer or the one using illegal connection.
He contended that the KE policy to collectively punish the entire neighbourhood due to default of a few individuals was not only the violation of the Nepra Act and relevant rules but also sheer infringement of Articles 4 and 25 of the Constitution.
He maintained the right of electricity has been recognised as a fundamental right by the superior and higher judiciary while Section 21 of the Nepra Act 1997 bound the power utility to provide power to all the customers on a non-discriminatory basis and to follow performance standards laid down by the regulatory authority.
The petitioner pleaded to declare the impugned action of KE as illegal, unconstitutional and without jurisdiction and sought directives for respondents to immediately restore the electricity of the area.

https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1967315,"FPCCI warns against widespread textile factory closures, unemployment amid high energy tariffs, taxes - Dawn","The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) on Friday warned that Pakistan’s industrial sector was facing asevere crisisdue to high energy tariffs and heavy taxation, leading to widespread factory closures and job losses.
In December, it wasreportedthat over 100 spinning mills and over 400 ginning factories had become non-operational, triggered by unprecedented taxes, high power tariffs, and a surge in under-invoiced cotton yarn and fabric imports from China and other countries.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, President FPCCI Atif Ikram Sheikh said, “Costly electricity has crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector.”
“Around 150 large textile units had shut down over the past two years,” he stated.
Sheikh urged the government to immediately abolish cross-subsidies imposed on the industrial sector and reduce the policy rate to single digits.
He proposed thatinterest ratesbe cut first to nine per cent and subsequently to seven per cent to revive industrial growth and investment.
Trader and business leader SM Tanvir said that the situation had also been highlighted in the World Economic Forum’s 2026 report, which increased Pakistan’s risk rating.
“According to the report,” he said, “The business activity and employment opportunities in the country are declining, while the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector has been reduced to a junkyard.”
Tanvir criticised tax policies, saying “non-filers face no scrutiny when depositing money in banks, but are heavily taxed”. “It appears the Federal Board of Revenue is working to please banks,” he alleged.
FPCCI officials warned that if the government failed to urgently address the issue of expensive electricity, the industrial sector could come to a “standstill”.
The officials criticised the government and the Power Division for not passing the relief of reduction in electricity tariff to the industrial consumers.
Recently, after NEPRA determined areductionin the base tariff of electricity, the power division maintained that the number of domestic consumersavailingsubsidised rates was very high.
They emphasised that there was additional electricity available in the country, but the capacity charges for unused power units were paid by the citizens of the country.
Furthermore, they highlighted that the industrial tariff was around 12.5 cents per unit in Pakistan, whereas it was around 7.5 cents in India.
They appealed to the prime minister to “remove the industry from the ventilator” and reduce taxes on the export sector to prevent further economic decline.
According to ananalysis, Pakistan’s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed.
It further said that high and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation.","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:35:37 GMT",,"The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) warned that Pakistan’s industrial sector was facing asevere crisis.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967697/pakistans-exchange-rate-illusion,Pakistan’s exchange rate illusion - Dawn,"The exchange rate is a critical economic variable for Pakistan. A competitive and credible currency regime should form the core of the nation’s economic strategy, particularly given the country’s dependence on foreign exchange for growth.
Unfortunately, Pakistan has repeatedly used the exchange rate as a short-term stabilisation tool, often holding it at levels that favour political convenience rather than economic fundamentals. Once reserves are depleted, this approach has led to abrupt and disruptive corrections consistently undermining rather than enhancing export potential.
That said, it is incredibly important to have a competitive exchange rate as it improves export margins, encourages investment in tradable goods, and signals the viability of producing for global markets.
History shows that prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports
However, rate alone is insufficient; credibility is equally essential. Exporters are willing to invest and scale up operations only if they trust that relative prices will remain broadly aligned with fundamentals over time. In Pakistan’s case, this trust has been repeatedly eroded.
The Musharraf era
During the Musharraf administration, the rupee was kept stable at around Rs60 to the dollar throughout much of the 2000s. While this stability created an illusion of macroeconomic soundness, it concealed growing external imbalances.
When the pressures finally surfaced, the adjustment was late and severe: from 2007 to 2009, the rupee dropped from roughly Rs60 to over Rs80 per dollar as reserves collapsed and an International Monetary Fund intervention became necessary. Exporters, who had operated under an overvalued currency, did not suddenly become competitive. Instead, they faced higher input costs, disrupted financing, and weakened financial positions.
Stability over fundamentals
The above pattern recurred between 2013 and 2017, with the rupee held between Rs100–105 per dollar despite widening current-account deficits and falling reserves. Exporters consistently warned about the currency’s overvaluation, but policy makers focused on maintaining price stability and political optics. When the inevitable adjustment occurred, it was abrupt and disorderly: the rupee’s value dropped sharply in mid-2017, followed by a larger correction after 2018, reaching around Rs160 per dollar by mid-2019. This sudden realignment destabilised firms and inflation expectations instead of supporting a smooth transition.
Market distortions and eroding confidence
The last three years have proven even more damaging. Administrative controls, delayed adjustments, and the emergence of multiple exchange rates pushed pressure into informal markets.
In early 2023, the rupee experienced one of its steepest single-day falls, losing nearly 10 per cent within hours. Over the year, it depreciated by close to 30pc percent, at one point briefly approaching Rs300 per dollar before settling near Rs285 when administrative controls were introduced.
These shifts coincided with harsh stabilisation measures such as import compression, punitive interest rates, higher energy prices, and increased taxes. Any potential export gains from depreciation were negated by rising costs and collapsing confidence.
Repeatedly underminig exports
These episodes highlight a clear lesson: prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax onexportsand a subsidy to imports. This encourages consumption and rent-seeking while discouraging investment in tradable sectors. When adjustment is finally forced, it comes as a crisis — too sudden and volatile to generate the intended export response. Exporters cannot recover lost markets overnight, nor can they invest amidst uncertainty and tightening financial conditions.
Gradual adjustment and integrated policy
Successful export economies do not rely on dramatic devaluations. Instead, they allow gradual, market-aligned adjustments, avoid prolonged misalignments, and resist using the exchange rate as a political tool. Effective currency policy is complemented by competitive energy pricing, predictable taxation, efficient logistics, and skills development, enabling exporters to respond to price signals.
For example, Vietnam has pursued gradual adjustments that avoid prolonged overvaluation and limit volatility, giving exporters the confidence to invest and integrate into global value chains. Bangladesh has similarly adopted a steady crawl rather than crisis-driven devaluations, preserving export competitiveness and market share — a model Pakistan has repeatedly failed to emulate.
Conclusion: toward a credible exchange rate policy
Pakistan’s core issue is not deciding between a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ rupee. Rather, it is the persistent belief that administrative controls can substitute for competitiveness. Until the exchange-rate policy reflects fundamentals on a sustained basis and is part of a broader, credible export strategy, depreciation will remain disruptive, and exports will continue to be vulnerable to future crises.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967272,Punjab’s EV transition - Dawn,"THE Punjab government’s decision to restrict future official vehicle purchases to electric and hybrid models represents a significant policy shift in a province choking on toxic smog. Given the limited size of the official fleet and the gradual pace of its replacement, the move is unlikely to deliver immediate improvement in air quality. Nevertheless, by committing itself to electric and hybrid vehicles as part of its smog mitigation strategy, Punjab is sending a strong market signal to both automakers and car owners to make the shift away from petrol and diesel-powered transport towards cleaner alternatives. By linking future permissions for petrol pumps with the installation of EV charging stations, the government will fast-track the expansion of charging infrastructure and tackle the main impediment to faster EV adoption: range anxiety.
The importance of transition to EVs cannot be overstated. While crop burning is often blamed for toxic air quality in the province — especially in cities like Lahore — several reports conclude that the transport sector is perhaps the more permanent and leading contributor to smog conditions. Transport emissions can account for 39pc to 43pc of air pollution depending on the city, according to some assessments. These emissions are driven by a combination of low-quality fuels and aging vehicle fleets. The problem is complicated by traffic congestion, the reports argue, increasing exhaust emissions in urban areas. While the steps taken by Punjab, such as gradual electrification of mass transport systems in major cities and the distribution of thousands of e-bikes among girls are commendable, the lax enforcement of its plans to crack down on smoke-emitting vehicles is concerning. The transition towards electric mobility will take a long time, official intentions and interventions notwithstanding. Hence, the push for electric transition in the province must be accompanied by sustained, tough actions against polluting petrol and diesel vehicles if the authorities want to deliver breathable air to citizens.

LONDON: Global markets face a fresh bout of volatility after President Donald Trump vowed to slaptariffson eight European nations until the US is allowed to buy Greenland.
Trump said he would impose an additional 10pc import tariffs from Feb 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25pc on June 1 if no deal is reached.
“Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now — and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmied-ing said, expecting the euro could come under pressure when Asian trade begins.
“The US-EU trade war is back,” said Tina Fordham, strategist and Fordham Global Foresight founder.
On Sunday, European leaders slammed the tariff threat over their opposition to his designs on Greenland, warning transatlantic ties were at risk. “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement.
An extraordinary meeting of its ambassadors was called in Brussels on Sunday by the EU, which clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15pc US levy.
France’s President Emmanuel Macron will ask the EU to activate a never-before-used “anti-coercion instrument” against the US if Trump makes good on his tariff threat, Macron’s aides said.
Even Trump’s European allies baulked at the threat.
Italy’s far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, called the threatened tariffs a ‘mistake’. “I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake,” she said during her Seoul trip.
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel called Trump’s threat an “inexplicable” form of “blackmail”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was planning to discuss the situation with Trump “at the earliest opportunity”, UK culture minister Lisa Nandy told theBBC, calling the president’s tariff threat “wrong”.
“We believe it’s deeply unhelpful, and we believe it’s counterproductive, and the prime minister has not shied away from making that clear,” she said.
Trade war fear
France’s Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington, too.
“In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists,” she told broadcastersEurope 1andCNews.
Norway, targeted by the tariff threat but, like Britain, not an EU member, said it was not currently looking at retaliation against US goods.
“I think one needs to stop and think so that a trade war can be averted that would lead to a downward spiral. Nobody would win,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store toldNRKtelevision.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1966925,"PPP continues to question Islamabad deforestation, expresses dissatisfaction with answers given in NA - Dawn","The PPP on Wednesday continued questioning the government on the recent deforestation in Islamabad, expressing dissatisfaction with the answers given by the government in a session of the National Assembly (NA) a day earlier.
In the past few days, there has been widespreadcriticismover the cutting of thousands of mature trees in various locations of the federal capital, including the levelling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian.
On Tuesday, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had informed lawmakers that29,115 treeshad been removed from the Islamabad Capital Territory region (ICT), but that more than this number would be planted in the coming months.
PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri, addressing a press conference, said that the issue had been raised in the NA as “all parliamentarians were concerned”, hoping that they would receive answers to the “questions that have been flying about”.
However, she said, the response by the state minister for interior during Tuesday’s NA session had only raised more questions.
“Sometimes it is said that it is because of pollen allergies … yesterday another impression was given, that there are some brown districts and some green districts — so you have to keep some brown and some green,” Marri said.
“At what cost? At the cost of your environment? At the cost of urban planning? At the cost of biodiversity in your urban areas? At what cost?”
She pointed out that not only were political parties asking these questions, but also civil society, adding that the World Wide Fund of Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) had also shown serious concern about the way the trees were being cut down.
“It is not just cutting,” she said. “It is an action that is challenging your environmental governance; it raises questions on transparency.”
Marri particularly took exception to the lack of transparency shown by the government in its response to the outcry.
“You tell us: for however many trees you have cut, how many have you planted? We are not being shown this. We are only shown trees being cut, not planted.“
“We don’t know how many trees are being planted — we are only told that these many thousands have been planted. But what proof is there of this?” she added.
The lawmaker further said, “To give them some benefit of the doubt: if you cut the trees and there was some good reason for it, then why are you running from giving answers?”
Marri added that Chaudhry “should have given a patient answer” in the NA session yesterday.
“He felt that maybe the CDA [Capital Development Authority] was being attacked; it was not like that.”
She further said, “If you’re going to cut trees by the thousands in Pakistan’s capital — that is the face of your country — and so boldly, then the question will be raised… and will not just be asked to you by political parties, by the PPP, but the public will ask, civil society will ask, journalists will ask. They ask you and you get upset — that is not appropriate.”
“If there is indeed purity in this action of yours, then share it. Tell us,” she added.
Marri regretted that the government had not given a press conference on the matter of the trees, saying, “There’s a press conference on everything. But why did the government not take the public into confidence on the cutting of trees, through a press conference or a media briefing? This should have happened, and I regret to say it did not.”
The CDA has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed, as they had beencausing pollen allergies. However, social media users hadallegedthat, besides paper mulberry, indigenous trees were also chopped down, making Shakarparian look like barren land.
Climate Change Minister Musadiq Malik hasdefended the move, stating that paper mulberry was an invasive and “life-threatening” species.
At the same press conference, Marri slammed the state of load shedding in Pakistan, particularly focusing on Sindh.
She said that if one called their sub-divisional officer, they would be told that the load shedding was because a household had not paid their electricity bill: “If one house didn’t pay the electricity bill, then you’ll cut electricity for the whole neighbourhood? … If not paying the bill is illegal, then cutting the electricity of those who do pay the bill is also illegal.”
Marri lamented that this was the state of affairs in winter, wondering what would happen in summer.
She also condemned gas load shedding and the lack of gas provided to Sindh, including Karachi, although it was a natural resource found in Sindh.
She added that according to Article 158 of the Constitution, the first right to gas went to the people of the wellhead region.
However, she said, people were being deprived of gas and when gas was available, they were being sold imported gas at high prices.","Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:18:00 GMT",,"The PPP says it is concerned about the number of trees being cut down in Islamabad.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967803,"Situationer: Kinnow trapped by border closure, Iran sanctions - Dawn","
THE gate of a kinnow polishing and grading factory on the outskirts of Bhalwal, Sargodha district opens gingerly, and a middle-aged orchard owner steps in. His voice trembles as he makes an unusual request: “buy my kinnow at whatever rate you can”. The wedding date of his daughter is fixed, he says, and the fruit on his trees is the only asset he has left to turn into cash.
Factory managers hear such pleas daily this season. What was once routine commercial transaction has turned into human drama, reflecting a crisis engulfing Pakistan’s citrus economy — one shaped by closed borders, rising costs, policy neglect, and the shadow of international sanctions linked to Iran.
Pakistan’s kinnow exporters face a perfect storm as the traditional overland route to Russia and adjoining markets through Afghanistan remains effectively closed. For years, this corridor allowed kinnow to reach Russia, Ukraine and Central Asian Republics within six to nine days, keeping the fruit fresh and competitive.
With that route blocked due to tensions with Kabul on security affairs, exporters are diverting shipments through Iran — a route that takes around 25 days, significantly increasing transit time, costs and spoilage risk. What was once a backup option has become the primary route, and even that has become geopolitically risky.
The fruit, which could reach Russia within six to nine days through Afghanistan, now has to be routed through Iran. This journey takes 25 days, too long for perishable fruit. But Trump’s threat of 25pc tariff on countries trading with Iran has made even this backup route geopolitically risky
Adding to exporters’ anxiety are renewed threats by US President Donald Trump to impose a 25 per cent tariff on countries trading with Iran, raising fears that reliance on Iranian transit and markets could invite penalties or complicate access to Western destinations.
Govt claims vs reality
Last week, the federal government announced that Punjab’s farmers would be allowed to export kinnow and potatoes through “alternative routes”. Growers and exporters say the announcement offers little practical relief.
“Iran was never a newly opened route,” says Hanif Hanjra, a small orchard owner. “It has always been there, mainly used after Iran finishes its own mandarin crop. Calling it an alternative to Afghanistan is misleading.”
According to growers, Iran cannot replace the Afghan corridor in terms of speed or cost. “Through Afghanistan, kinnow would reach its destination fresh and competitive. Through Iran, the journey is simply too long for a perishable fruit. Resultantly, the shipment costs multiply manifold,” Hanjra says.
Growers recall that Pakis­tan’s presence in Russ­ian, Ukrainian and Central Asian markets was built largely through exporters’ own initiatives, particularly after Asean countries restricted kinnow import as Pakistani authorities failed to meet required documentation due to alleged demands for bribes and bureaucratic inertia.
Sajid Wining, a grower-cum-exporter who remained Pakistan’s top fruit exporter for nearly 14 years, said he eventually exited the kinnow business due to chronic policy neglect. “At their peak, kinnow exports earned around $450 million annually,” he said. “Yet fruit and vegetable exports were never trea­ted as a strategic priority.”
He also criticised the fai­l­ure to develop seedless kinnow varieties, while com­petitors such as China and Egypt moved ahead with seedless mandarins, capturing premium markets.
Price crash amid bumper crop
The crisis has hit orch­ard owners brutally. A former MPA and ex-tehsil nazim of Sahiwal, Ghulam Ali Asghar Lahri, said juice factories are offering as little as Rs300 per maund.
He revealed that a contractor who had purchased his orchard for Rs27.5 million — paying Rs1.5 million as advance — walked away from the deal, forfeiting the amount because expe­cted losses were far greater. “Some of my relatives are uprooting kinnow plants altogether,” Mr Lahri said. “They don’t see this crisis ending anytime soon.”
Mohammad Mohsin Warraich, patron of Anjuman Kashtkaran, Sargodha, said the irony is that this year’s kinnow crop is bumper and globally appreciated for its taste and appearance. Yet growers are being forced to sell at Rs1,200 per maund or even less, compared to Rs2,500–3,200 last season.
“Factory owners exploit growers by citing Afghan border closures,” he said. “But only C-grade kinnow goes to Afghanistan, and its production is very low this year. A-grade fruit is exported by sea, and that route is open.”
Mr Warraich added that Iran has, unlike previous years, reduced duties on kinnow imports and transit to Russia and CARs from the start of the season. “So why are prices collapsing?” he asked.
Former MPA and citrus grower Iftikhar Gondal said kinnow production costs have multiplied since the sharp devaluation of the rupee in 2022. Fertilisers, pesticides and labour have become prohibitively expensive, while returns have collapsed.
“One acre of kinnow orchard fetched around Rs100,000 last year; this season it is barely Rs30,000,” he said. “Many growers cannot even find buyers for their orchards.” This uncertainty has also led to a drastic drop in land contract rates — from Rs200,000 per acre annually to Rs70,000, he said.
Mr Gondal alleged that factory owners have formed cartels to fix rates, exploiting farmers while continuing exports. He estimated that nearly 30pc of kinnow orchards have already been uprooted, with farmers shifting to maize, sugarcane and other crops.
Zahoor Haral, a mid-level kinnow grower, warned that repeated crop shocks are pushing farmers toward selling land and migrating to cities or abroad. “The rural economy is collapsing,” he said, noting that contractors, labourers, transporters and shopkeepers all suffer when farmers lose purchasing power.
He dismissed the argument that low prices are driven by border closures alone. “Exporters buying kinnow at throwaway prices are not dumping it locally; they are shipping it abroad. So the excuse doesn’t hold.”
Shadow of sanctions
Hovering over the entire crisis is the geopolitical risk tied to Iran. Trump’s threat of a 25pc tariff on countries trading with Tehran has unnerved exporters, who fear that dependence on Iranian routes could expose them to penalties or market restrictions.
Growers are now calling for structural reforms: the creation of Kissan Markets to allow direct sales to consumers, promotion of value addition through juice, pulp and powder processing units, and the establishment of a Citrus Control Board —similar to the Sugarcane Control Board — to regulate pricing and transactions between growers and factories.
Until such measures are taken, orchard owners say scenes like the one at the factory gate — fathers pleading to sell fruit at any price to meet family obligations — will only multiply. And Pakistan risks losing not just export markets, but an entire citrus economy once considered a flagship of its agricultural exports, now squeezed between closed borders, rising costs and global politics far beyond farmers’ control.

The calendar has turned, but the memories of 2025 remain vivid. The year 2025 was not merely a sequence of days; it was a collection of moments lived with friends, colleagues, and companions of circumstance. The people we worked with, laughed with, struggled alongside, and sometimes even disagreed with have left lasting impressions.
For many, the new year also brings change — new workplaces, new roles, or new paths altogether. And with those changes comes a quiet sense of loss. Offices once familiar, desks once occupied, routines once repeated have now become memories.
The simple conversations, shared tea breaks, and collective efforts will be missed. Time moves forward without mercy. The days that have gone will never return, and this realisation often leaves the human heart in confusion. What remains when everything else changes? What truly endures is character. In the end, people remember not positions or titles, but how they were treated — who cared, who stood by them, who acted with kindness when it mattered most.
The early days of the new year on the world stage are not quite what one might have hoped for. Hope is fragile, but hope is all that we must cling on to. Let us hope that 2026 will be a fantastic year by the time it, too, comes to an end.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967628,Failed power reform - Dawn,"NEPRA’S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.
In fact, the power sector’s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector’s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector’s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator’s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.

The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) warned that the industrial sector was facing a severe crisis due to high energy tariffs and heavy taxes, leading to factory closures and job losses.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, FPCCI leaders criticised the government and the Power Division for not passing on to industrial consumers the benefit of a recent reduction in the base electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
They said the Power Division had maintained the industrial base tariff, citing a high number of domestic consumers receiving subsidised rates.
FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh said costly electricity had crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector. He said around 150 large textile units had shut down during the past two years.
FPCCI says high electricity rates, taxes lead to closure of 150 textile units in two years
Mr Sheikh urged the government to abolish cross-subsidies imposed on industry and reduce the policy rate to single digits. He proposed cutting interest rates initially to 9 per cent and then to 7pc to revive industrial growth and investment.
The FPCCI appealed to the prime minister to take urgent decisions to save the remaining industry and warned that units that had closed or relocated were unlikely to restart operations in Pakistan.
FPCCI leaders also pointed to surplus electricity in the system, saying capacity charges for unused power were being passed on to consumers.
S.M. Tanvir, patron-in-chief of the United Business Group — which holds a majority in the FPCCI — rejected the electricity incentive package and said the situation had also been highlighted in the World Economic Forum’s 2026 report, which he said had increased Pakistan’s risk rating.
He said the report showed business activity and employment opportunities were declining, while the small and medium enterprises sector had been reduced to what he described as a “junkyard”.
He criticised tax policies, saying non-filers face no scrutiny when depositing money in banks, but are heavily taxed and questioned when investing in real estate. “It appears the Federal Board of Revenue is working to please banks,” he alleged.
FPCCI officials warned that if the government failed to urgently address the issue of expensive electricity, the industrial sector could come to a standstill.
They appealed to the prime minister to “remove the industry from the ventilator” and reduce taxes on the export sector to prevent further economic decline.
It was highlighted that the industrial tariff was around 12.5 US cents per unit in Pakistan, whereas it was around 7.5 cents in India.
United Business Group Secre­tary General Zafar Bakh­tawari, in a light remark at the end of the press conference, said it appeared economic stability could also contribute to political stability, as people engaged in jobs and businesses were less likely to be distracted by politics and crime.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1966676,Subsidised consumers eat up power tariff cut - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Challenges in the power sector continue to grow as the number of poor and subsidised consumers more than doubled to 21 million in three years, offsetting a 62-paisa per unit reduction in the national average electricity rates due from Jan 1.
In a record and historic speed, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Mondayissuedits determination for annual tariff rebasing just a couple of hours after conducting a public hearing on the government’s request. The decision drew criticism from multiple businesses, including representatives of the textile industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
In its ruling, the regulator said: “Although the average tariff has been reduced by Rs0.62/kWh, the reduction has been eaten up by changes in the sales mix, as the number of subsidised consumers has increased exponentially from 9.5m in FY22 to 20.71m as of June 2025.”
All these consumers fall within the consumption bracket of less than 200 units per month, with per-unit rates ranging from Rs7.74 to Rs13 against a marginal rate of about Rs25 per unit. Beyond this consumption, the per-unit rate gradually rises to Rs47 per unit, excluding taxes. “With this shift, consumption by subsidised consumers has also increased from 8.527 billion units in FY21 to 19.7bn units as of June 2025,” Nepra added.
The regulator said the total revenue requirement of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) for 2026 decreased by Rs142bn compared to FY26, resulting in the 62-paisa per unit reduction, mainly due to a decrease in the power purchase price (PPP) for CY2026. Going forward, tariff rebasing will take place on a calendar-year basis (starting January 1) instead of the fiscal year, reducing the impact of tariff increases coinciding with high-consumption months starting July 1.
Despite this change in the sales mix, the government decided to maintain the existing applicable tariffs for each consumer category. Out of the total determined revenue requirement of Rs3.379 trillion for Discos, Rs248bn will be covered as a subsidy from the budget.
Various industrialists protested the decision not to pass the 62-paisa per unit reduction to industrial consumers, calling it selective, unjustified, and discriminatory.
Industrial cross-subsidy tariffs continue to carry an estimated Rs5-7 per unit, a policy-driven burden that has rendered Pakistani industry regionally uncompetitive, according to Rehan Javed from Karachi. He added that removing this cross-subsidy would immediately reduce tariffs to 9-10 US cents per unit, restoring competitiveness and supporting exports.
Industrialists argued that uniform tariffs were being used to conceal inefficiencies rather than correct them, with costs being socialised upward through industrial tariffs instead of addressing Disco inefficiencies.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1966586/apple-chooses-googles-gemini-ai-to-power-siri-assistant,Apple chooses Google’s Gemini AI to power Siri assistant - Dawn,"Tech giants Apple and Google on Monday announced a multi-year partnership that will see Apple’s next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) features, including its Siri assistant, be powered by Google’s Gemini technology.
The collaboration marks a significant shift for Apple, which has traditionally developed its core technologies in-house.
A joint statement said Apple selected Google’s AI technology after a “careful evaluation” determined it provided “the most capable foundation” for the iPhone-maker’s AI ambitions.
The announcement represents a rare alliance between two companies that have long competed in the smartphone market, where Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems dominate globally.
However, the two rivals have maintained a lucrative partnership for years, with Google paying Apple billions of dollars annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices.
That arrangement has faced scrutiny from regulators, with the US Justice Department arguing in an antitrust case that the deal helps Google maintain its search monopoly, though a judge said the arrangement could continue.
Financial details of the AI arrangement were not provided.
Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the partnership was “a major validation moment for Google” and “a stepping stone” for Apple to get its AI strategy on track into 2026 and beyond.
Apple reportedly also considered partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity.
The company co-founded by Steve Jobs is largely perceived to have stumbled in efforts to roll out AI capabilities across its products and last month announced the head of its artificial intelligence team was stepping down.
Apple last year delayed the release of an improved Siri digital assistant and is now promising it for later in the year.
Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and other tech rivals have been releasing ever-improved AI models and features in a fierce race to lead the sector.
Despite the collaboration, Apple emphasised that its in-house AI system, Apple Intelligence, will be used to power its iPhones and iPads at the device-only level, maintaining what it described as “industry-leading privacy standards“.","Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:34:27 GMT",,"Apple's next-generation AI features will be powered by Google's Gemini technology.
