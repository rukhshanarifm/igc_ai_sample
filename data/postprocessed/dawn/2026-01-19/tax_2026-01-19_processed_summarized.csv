https://www.dawn.com/news/1967234,Bilawal touts Sindh govt performance to dispel ‘negative impression’ - Dawn,"• PPP chairman says service delivery improved, institutions strengthened during party’s rule• Says health sector allocations increased to nearly 10pc from 2.9pc in 2008; wind farms producing 1,845MW• Recalls how province rebuilt 2.1 million flood-hit homes on climate-resilient lines
ISLAMABAD: A day after claiming that ‘some powers’ wanted to deprive Sindh of its rights, PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday said the province had been consistently strengthening its institutions and improving service delivery, as he went on to list the achievements of the PPP government.
The PPP leader made these comments at an event at the President’s House in the federal capital, where he gave a detailed presentation, while negating the impression that Sindh lagged behind other provinces in terms of progress.
Sindh is often portrayed as a “glass half empty” province, he said, adding that the PPP-led government had steadily strengthened institutions and expanded service delivery. In his speech, the PPP chief highlighted the Sindh government’s performance since 2008 in the fields of healthcare, education, poverty alleviation, infrastructure, industry, agriculture and revenue generation.
Focusing on healthcare, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said Sindh had increased health sector allocations from 2.9 per cent of the provincial budget in 2008 to nearly 10pc. He also highlighted the expansion of major public hospitals, including the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where bed capacity had doubled from 1,100 to 2,200 by 2025, with a target of 3,100 beds by 2028.
He said that the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) operated 11 specialised hospitals and 30 chest pain units across the province. Referring to the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), he said more than 35 million patients had benefited from its services since 2008, while its bed capacity had increased from 760 to 1,926.
About the education sector, the PPP chairman said that the number of public universities in Sindh had increased from 10 in 2008 to 30, along with 18 additional university campuses across the province.
On poverty alleviation, he said that the Sindh Rural Support Organisation (SRSO) helped lift 1.4 million women out of poverty through soft loans, with a recovery rate of 98 per cent.
Recalling the devastatingfloodsof 2022, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said around 2.1 million houses were destroyed across the province. In response, the Sindh government launched a massive housing initiative to build 2.1 million climate-resilient homes. Of these, 750,000 had been completed, while around 1.5 million were under construction. He said the project had created nearly one million jobs.
In the agriculture sector, he said the provincial government distributed wheat seed worth over Rs2.1 billion to 215,000 farmers following the floods, leading to a harvest of 4.5 million tonnes the following season.
He claimed that public transport was virtually absent in the province before 2008, but PPP-led initiatives now facilitated daily travel for over 200,000 passengers, including through the introduction of electric buses.
Energy sector
On energy, he said Sindh had the potential to generate 50,000 megawatts of wind energy, alongside vastsolarcapacity. Currently, 1,845MW is being produced from wind projects. He said 200,000 solar home systems had already been provided to households, with another 275,000 homes set to be solarised.
The PPP chairman also highlighted environmental gains, saying mangrove forest cover in Sindh had expanded from 270,000 acres to a record 675,000 acres.
Addressing revenue generation, he said the Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) had collected Rs28 billion in 2011, compared to Rs10 billion collected by the Federal Board of Revenue in 2010, a 68 per cent increase over federal collections at the time. He said the SRB’s average annual growth rate of 19 per cent far exceeded the Federal Board of Revenue’s 10 per cent.
Calling for fiscal reforms, Mr Bhutto-Zardari proposed devolving the collection of sales tax on goods to provinces, arguing that provincial revenue authorities had consistently outperformed the FBR.
Meanwhile, political circles criticised him for using the platform of the Presidency to outline the performance of the Sindh government. The event took place when Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s father, President Asif Ali Zardari, was on an official visit to Bahrain. PM Adviser Rana Sanaullah said in a private TV show: “Bilawal should not have advocated the case of Sindh in the Presidency.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1964382,Collection falls short by Rs331bn in July-December - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue missed its revenue collection target by nearly Rs331 billion in the first half of 2025-26, driven by a fall in domestic sales tax and income tax collection.
The FBR collected Rs6.159 trillion during July-December period against the target of Rs6.490tr. However, the collection is 10pc higher compared to the year-ago figure of Rs5.618tr.
The revenue shortfall is primarily attributed to a slowdown in domestic sales tax collection, driven by several factors. The decline was also recorded in the income tax collection during 1HFY26.
As a result of these factors, the revenue collection fell short of target by Rs21bn in December FY26 to Rs1.425tr against the projected target of Rs1.446tr. However, it recorded a growth of 7.38pc when compared with the last year collection of Rs1.327tr in December FY25.
FBR raises Rs6.159tr against projection of Rs6.490tr
The IMF, in its last review, has already revised down the FBR’s annual tax collection target by Rs150bn. However, this shortfall could widen further if economic activity fails to rebound in the coming months.
In the FY25, the FBR missed its revenue collection target by nearly Rs163bn after two-times downward revision and collected Rs11.737tr against the revised target of Rs11.900tr. However, the collection reflects a year-on-year growth of 26.19pc from Rs9.301tr in FY24.
In line with its commitments under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, the government has introduced additional revenue measures totalling Rs1.05tr in the last budget. These include Rs655bn in new tax initiatives and Rs400bn through intensified enforcement. The revenue collection target for fiscal year 2025-26 is Rs14.131tr.
The FBR issued Rs293bn in refunds and rebates to taxpayers during July-December FY26, up from Rs277bn a year earlier, an increase of 5.77pc.
During July-December FY26, income tax collection reached Rs3.26tr, falling short of target by Rs161bn against the target of Rs3.187tr. This reflects a 9pc increase from Rs2.778tr collected last year.
Sales tax collection stood at Rs2.086tr, showing a shortfall of Rs172bn against the projection of Rs2.258tr. However, grew 10pc over last year’s Rs1.897tr. Customs duty collection stood at Rs642bn against the target of Rs654bn, though it grew by 8pc compared to Rs596bn last year.
The Federal Excise Duty collection reached Rs400bn against the projected target of Rs391bn and a growth of 16pc from last year’s Rs347bn.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1962570,"Tax-to-GDP ratio to stall over five years, IMF expects - Dawn","ISLAMABAD: With a 1.4 percentage-point increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio last year, mostly through additional revenue measures worth Rs2.5 trillion, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) now expects the federal tax contribution to remain stagnant over the next five years and a slight improvement coming from provinces.
The latest IMF estimates suggest Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) receipts rose from 8.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023-24 to 10.3pc in 2024-25, but still missed the Fund’s programme target of 10.7pc.
For the current fiscal year, the IMF projects FBR revenue at 11.1pc of GDP, which would then remain flat at that level until FY30.
In absolute terms, FBR revenue increased from Rs9.3tr in FY24 to Rs11.74tr in FY25, with a massive shortfall. For the current year, collections are projected at Rs13.98tr, implying a shortfall of Rs328 billion under existing assumptions.
The IMF noted that tax revenue collection in FY25 fell short by Rs1.224tr relative to budget projections and by Rs524bn relative to the lender’s first review target. About Rs850bn of the shortfall relative to the budget reflected faster-than-expected inflation deceleration and lower-than-expected GDP growth in FY25.
Forecasts provincial taxes to offset stagnant federal collections
The inflation deceleration at the end of FY25 led to a revenue shortfall of Rs157bn relative to the first IMF review target. The remaining portion of about Rs380bn was broadly linked to administrative and enforcement challenges that remained unaddressed throughout FY25, chiefly because of prolonged settlement of tax court cases that delayed the recovery of significant revenue amounts.
Overall revenues, including non-tax receipts, rose sharply to 15.9pc of GDP by the end of FY25 from 12.6pc in FY24. The Fund attributed the increase mainly to stronger receipts from the petroleum levy and State Bank profits.
The IMF expects the petroleum levy to remain a key source of revenue, rising from Rs1.02tr in FY24 to more than Rs2.2tr by FY30. It projected the levy’s contribution at about 1.1pc of GDP over the medium term, rising to around 1.2pc in the current and next fiscal years before easing back.
The Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30, while the sales tax ratio is expected to hover around its existing level of 3.5-3.6pc of GDP.
It said major contributions are projected to come from provincial taxes on the expectations of successful implementation of the agriculture income tax and sales taxes on services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to increase from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27, rise further to 1.6pc of GDP in FY28 and then stay flat until FY30.
In absolute numbers, the four provinces that collected Rs929bn in FY25 are expected to deliver Rs1.22tr during the current fiscal and further improve their collection to Rs1.77tr in FY27. They would build upon this base to collect Rs2.5tr in FY28, Rs2.8tr in FY29 and cross Rs3.1tr in FY30.
The Fund said projected FBR collections would depend on advancing reforms to raise revenues through tax policy simplification and base broadening, supporting fiscal sustainability and creating space for climate resilience, social protection, human capital development and public investment.
It noted that FBR revenues rose 26pc year-on-year in FY25 to 10.3pc of GDP, a historically high level, but overall tax revenue still fell short of the target by 0.3pc of GDP, largely due to delays in resolving court cases over disputed taxes (0.4pc of GDP) and lower-than-expected inflation. Lower-than-budgeted federal subsidies and grants, estimated at 0.2pc of GDP, helped offset the impact of the revenue shortfall.
The IMF said provinces had begun implementing new agricultural income tax (AIT) regimes, including measures to strengthen compliance and address underreporting.
“However, significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, notably fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities,” the Fund observed, adding that the provinces have also ensured that all services, except for a limited list of exemptions, are subject to GST.
It said the cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc, as has been the case for Pakistan over a long time.
In this way, the Fund projected the consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.4pc of GDP in FY25, easing to 4pc this year, before declining to 3.2pc in FY27 and FY28, and then to 2.8pc in FY30.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1966318,Pakistan Medical Association seeks PM’s intervention on FBR raids at clinics - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) has taken exception to the raids by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) at private healthcare centres, asking the prime minister to take notice of “aggressive”, “commando-style” searches by tax officials.
In a statement, the representative body of healthcare professionals said the “unannounced and aggressive entry of FBR teams into private healthcare facilities — particularly across Punjab — has reached an intolerable level of harassment”.
Such measures threaten the very fabric of healthcare delivery in the country, said PMA Secretary General Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro in a statement. “The PMA highlights that recent raids, which forced the immediate suspension of Outpatient Department (OPD) services, are not merely administrative issues; they constitute a direct interference in patient management and a violation of the sanctity of life-saving institutions,” according to the statement.
It said the presence of enforcement officials in clinics “creates an atmosphere of fear, causes psychological distress to patients, and disrupts surgical teams”.
Association claims such measures threaten fabric of healthcare delivery
“Tax collection must never come at the cost of human life. Doctors are not ‘traders,’ and hospitals are not ‘retail outlets’. The private sector serves over 70pc of Pakistan’s population. Treating healthcare providers as commercial vendors is a gross misinterpretation of a noble profession,” he stated.
“While we respect the rule of law, audits should be conducted through documented, professional channels not through ‘commando-style’ raids that victimise healers. This targeted victimisation discourages professional excellence and pushes our brightest medical minds to seek opportunities abroad,” it claimed.
The PMA said the doctors were ready to comply with taxation, provided there was accountability for how that money would be spent. “We demand that the tax collected from the sweat and toil of healers not be squandered on the luxurious lifestyles of the ruling elite,” he stated.
It called upon the PM and the finance minister to take immediate notice. “We demand an immediate cessation of these aggressive tactics,” Dr Shoro stated.
He warned that if the FBR does not immediately halt the ‘harassment’, the PMA will be forced to take the final, definitive step of a nationwide suspension of services. “The responsibility for any resulting healthcare crisis will rest solely on the shoulders of the FBR and the relevant authorities,” he added.
In December 2025, the FBRdeployedInland Revenue Service (IRS) officers to the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, marking a shift toward on-site monitoring. The initiative gained momentum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.
Official figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan’s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns.
Of the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1964795,Aurangzeb lauds FBR for record tax collection - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has described higher revenue collection in December as a strong validation of the government’s fiscal reform agenda and sustained focus on compliance, enfo­r­cement, and digitisation.
The remarks came from the minister while addressing the field formation via a video link conference on Friday. The minister described the December revenue collection the highest-ever recorded in December.
The FBR collected Rs1.427 trillion in December 2025 against the target of Rs1.446tr projected, indicating a shortfall of Rs19 billion. However, it recorded a growth of 7.5pc compared to Rs1.327tr collected same month last year.
“The progress made over the last 18 months is remarkable, and the December 2025 collection is extremely encouraging,” the minister said, adding the government’s strategy of digitising the economy, promoting cashless transactions, and strengthening enforcement while maintaining business momentum has begun to deliver tangible and sustainable results.
An official announcement said the minister said that this performance represents the highest revenue collection for December in any year, underscoring improved tax compliance and effective enforcement across the system.
Under the continuous supervision of the FBR Board and in line with the Finance Ministry’s reform roadmap, these results reflect a decisive shift toward stronger compliance, improved enforcement, and institutional accountability, reinforcing confidence in the government’s commitment to sustainable revenue gro­wth.
The minister urged FBR field formations to further intensify their efforts and double down on initiatives aimed at deepening and widening the tax net. He emphasised that better tax compliance and enforcement measures was the only sustainable way to ease the tax burden on the formal sector, added the announcement.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963889,2025 OUTLOOK : Tax relief held fast by IMF restraints - Dawn,"Meaningful relief for compliant income tax payers, salaried individuals and the corporate sector — who together contribute roughly half of Pakistan’s revenues — appears unlikely. Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead.
To avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy.
Those who trust the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure.
In 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government’s economic team’s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF.
A recent media report indicates that the IMF, which is closely monitoring Pakistan’s economic trajectory, also expects tax collection to remain broadly stagnant in CY26.
There appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best
From 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratioroseto 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27.
FBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal.
Musadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. “Both the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.”
Dr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. “At best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,” he said.
A source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. “I support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF’s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.”
Dr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. “Substantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.”
He also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand.
Covering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential.
Former federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan’s economic discourse. “All we hear is ‘tax, tax, tax’, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,” he remarked.
Rehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. “There is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF’s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor.
“I expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.”
Chairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1966895,Not the NFC’s fault - Dawn,"WITH the constitution of the 11th National FinanceCommission, the debate around revenue sharing takes centre-stage. For years, the federal government has repeated that 57.5 per cent of federal revenues are allocated to provinces, building the narrative that it is cash-strapped. This argument, while politically convenient, is misleading. When one examines the full composition of federal revenues, it becomes evident that the federal government retains close to 60pc of total revenues. A growing share of this is collected outside the NFC’s divisible pool, particularly through the petroleumlevy.
While politically expedient, relying on the petroleum levy and other surcharges as non-shareable revenue is deeply problematic. It bypasses the constitutional principles of the NFC, weakens the mechanism designed to ensure fair federal-provincial fiscal relations, and concentrates fiscal discretion in the hands of the federal executive. By creating a parallel pool of revenues untied to the NFC formula, the centre undermines transparency, and erodes trust in federalism. The narrative that provinces are draining the centre’s resources is false and distracts from structural issues in federal finances.
Another persistent fallacy is the proposal that provincial transfers should be tied to performance, often implying that the centre should oversee provincial outcomes. At first glance, such arguments may seem reasonable: if resources are allocated, accountability appears justified. However, this line of reasoningmisunderstandsPakistan’s fiscal federalism. The NFC was designed solely as a mechanism for revenue sharing, not as a supervisory instrument. Provinces have constitutionally defined responsibilities, strengthened by the 18th Amendment, and conditioning transfers on federal assessment risks violating the spirit of federalism.
Moreover, if performance were to determine transfers, the principle must apply equally to the federal government, whose own failures in tax collection, exchange rate management, and debt administration directly shape the fiscal environment in which provinces operate. One-sided accountability, where provinces are scrutinised while the centre is shielded, reflects political expediency more than economic prudence.
A permanent technical NFC will ensure debates are grounded in evidence rather than slogans.
Equally misleading is the claim that the seventh NFC Award is responsible for the federal government’s growing debt. Pakistan’s debt problem arises primarily from structural weaknesses and policy failures at the federal level. Two critical areas bear particular responsibility. First, the government’s exchange rate management has been erratic and often counterproductive. Persistent overvaluation in some periods, followed by sharp devaluations, has generated uncertainty, inflated the local currency value of foreign-denominated debt, and contributed to high inflation.
Second, Pakistan’s tax policies have consistently failed to raise revenue to sustainable levels. The federal tax-to-GDP ratio remains among the lowest in the region, reflecting poor base coverage, excessive exemptions, and weak enforcement. Together, these two policy failures, poor exchange rate management and inadequate taxation, have driven deficits, forced borrowing, and worsened debt sustainability. Misattributing debt accumulation to provincial transfers allows the federal government to avoid the reforms required to stabilise public finances, including rationalising expenditure, improving state-owned enterprises’ efficiency, and reforming pensions.
Recognising these fallacies is the first step towards reform. What Pakistan urgently needs is a permanent, technically grounded NFC as a foundational layer of the NFC architecture. Currently, the NFC primarily functions as a political negotiation every five years, producing headline-grabbing percentages without rigorous analysis. A standing body of economists and fiscal experts could provide transparent, evidence-based recommendations, track revenue distribution across tiers, model alternative formulas for divisible and non-divisible pools, and ensure transfers reflect a changing development landscape.
Institutionalising technical expertise would transform NFC negotiations from episodic political contests into disciplined, data-driven policymaking, prevent politically motivated distortions, ensure transparency, and build trust between the centre and provinces.
Alongside a permanent NFC, Pakistan must also deepen tax devolution to provinces and cities, but both the federal and provincial governments share responsibility for current weaknesses. While the federal government has centralised tax collection, leaving provinces with limited authority, provincial governments have often blocked local government systems and resisted meaningful devolution. This mutual reluctance has created a cycle in which provinces remain dependent on federal transfers, cities are underfunded, and citizens see limited accountability.
Strengthening subnational fiscal capacity requires reform at both levels: granting provinces and cities meaningful tax powers, including property taxes, and unified sales taxes, while modernising revenue administrations through digitalisation and analytics. Linking local revenue mobilisation to service delivery would ensure that fiscal authority is matched with citizen expectations and that local governments can become viable instruments of governance.
Taken together, these reforms address both the misconceptions surrounding NFC distribution and the structural realities of Pakistan’s fiscal landscape. Clarifying the true share of revenues corrects the false narrative of provincial generosity undermining the centre. Instituting a permanent technical NFC ensures debates are grounded in evidence rather than slogans. Expanding tax authority to provinces and cities strengthens fiscal capacity, enhances accountability, and improves service delivery. Each of these steps contributes to a balanced federal system, where resources are aligned with responsibilities and all tiers of government are incentivised to perform efficiently.
Addressing Pakistan’s fiscal challenges requires more than debates over numbers or blame-shifting. Policymakers must commit to long-term reforms that strengthen institutional capacity, enforce fiscal discipline, and create incentives for all tiers of government to raise and manage resources effectively. By embedding technical rigour into revenue-sharing mechanisms and empowering lower tiers of governments to mobilise and utilise resources efficiently, Pakistan can build a more resilient fiscal architecture. Only through consistent, evidence-based policymaking and cooperative governance can the country ensure that public funds translate into tangible services, economic growth, and trust in federalism for the citizens it serves.

Pakistan urgently needs a permanent, technically grounded NFC. Pakistan must deepen tax devolution to provinces and cities.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1962949,Stalled tax effort - Dawn,"PAKISTAN’S tax effort appears to have plateaued. Or so the latest IMF projections stress. After a jump of 1.4 percentage points in the tax-to-GDP ratio to 10.3pc in FY25, largely through additional revenue-enhancing measures that mostly burdened captive taxpayers — the salaried class and compliant businesses — the FBR tax collection as a ratio of the country’s GDP is projected to stagnate for the next five years. The only modest gains, if any, will likely come from provinces, and that too if they decide to effectively tax agriculture income and services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to jump from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27 and further to 1.6pc in FY28 before flattening until FY30. Overall, the country’s tax revenues are projected to flatten at 11.1pc of GDP — much below the 13.3pc mark the government has committed to achieve during the current IMF programme period — all the way through FY30. What the lender is signalling is that the government has ‘exhausted’ its option to raise taxation without fixing the underlying structural problems and better enforcement, or further burdening compliant sectors of the economy, or both.
The government’s growing dependence on non-tax revenue to prop up its fiscal position should be particularly concerning. Though the total government revenues surged to nearly 16pc of GDP in FY25, this increase has not resulted from the expansion of the tax base but from heavy petroleum levy and the State Bank’s profits. The levy has quietly morphed into a permanent quasi-tax on consumption in recent years, disproportionately burdening low-middle-income households. Another worrying fact is that Pakistan’s inequitable tax policy, which is over- reliant on indirect taxes while under-taxing or not taxing certain powerful lobbies, is likely to persist at the expense of economic growth and investment. That Pakistan’s economic growth depends on its ability to boost tax-to-GDP ratio is confirmed by cross-country evidence cited by the Fund: countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc — precisely where Pakistan has been for a while and appears destined to remain. In sum, faster economic growth will remain a pipe dream until fiscal consolidation is achieved through structural reforms instead of what many call stealth taxation.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court finally settled into its newly renovatedbuildingon Constitution Avenue on Monday, where FCC Chief Justice Amin­uddin Khan presided over a bench to resume hearing challenges to the imposition of the super tax inside the refurbished Courtroom No. 1.
Before the hearing, Justice Aminuddin Khan inaugurated the new court building in a simple ceremony attended by Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamir Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi and K.K. Agha, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rashid, FCC Registrar Hafeez Khan, along with lawyers and staff of the new establishment.
The FCC has a total sanctioned strength of 13 judges. Soon after its establishment, the FCC was shifted to the Islamabad High Court on a temporary basis, though it was originally envisaged that the new apex court would be housed in the building designated for the Federal Shariat Court (FSC). The FCC had to move to the IHC after FSC judges resisted the plan and denied access to their premises.
Courtroom No. 1 has been completely revamped with new furniture and fixtures, replacing the older seating, along with the installation of a modern audio system to facilitate lawyers and litigants.
However, a senior lawyer expres­sed disappointment over the curre­ntly available facilities in the buil­ding. “Neither is there a bar room for lawyers nor any canteen for litigants inside the FCC,” Advocate Tallat Abbas Khan toldDawn, adding that lawyers had no choice but to cross the road and enter the Supreme Court building just to sit and rest after a day’s work.
He said that since the FCC had become the country’s top court, it would attract a large number of lawyers and litigants in the future, but the facilities currently available were in­­sufficient to cope with the expected volume.
Inside Courtroom No. 1, lawyer Rashid Anwar complained before a three-judge bench headed by the FCC chief justice, hearing the super tax case, that he could not determine how much time he had consumed during arguments as there was no wall clock in the courtroom.
At this, the chief justice obser­ved that the present set-up lacked several facilities, but assured that the issues would be addressed soon.
Referring to a request regarding video-link facilities to different cities, the chief justice said that while the facility was currently not available, it might be provided in the future.
The new FCC building houses seven courtrooms, though only three are currently functional, all located on the first floor. Recently, 22,910 cases were transferred from the Supreme Court to the FCC.
Litigant Facilitation Centre
In a separate development, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi inaugurated a newly constructed room for advocates-on-record and a Litigant Facilitation Centre at the Supreme Court building as part of ongoing reforms aimed at strengthening service delivery and improving access to justice.
SCBA President Haroonur Rashid, along with members of his cabinet, was also present on the occasion. The newly established centre will provide structured facilitation to advocates-on-record, enabling them to guide litigants on procedural requirements, case filing, documentation and related matters.
However, some lawyers said the facility did not adequately cater to their needs.

https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1967132,"RCCI calls for lower taxes, fair regime to spur business growth - Dawn","RAWALPINDI: Emphasising the urgent need for a conducive and business-friendly tax environment to effectively broaden the tax net, the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (RCCI) hosted a high-level meeting with a visiting delegation of the Regional Tax Office (RTO), led by Ms Farhat Qayyum, Chief Commissioner, RTO.
RCCI highlighted that Pakistan currently has one of the highest tax rates in the region, which poses serious challenges to business growth and competitiveness. Addressing the gathering, RCCI President Usman Shaukat stressed that sustainable economic growth is not possible without a fair, predictable, and growth-orientated tax regime.
He urged the tax authorities to reduce the excessive burden on existing taxpayers, recognise and acknowledge compliant and high tax-paying businesses, and shift the focus towards broadening the tax base instead of repeatedly taxing the same segment.
Highlighting the issue of high taxation, President RCCI noted that when super tax and other levies are combined, the corporate tax rate effectively goes beyond 55 per cent, levels more commonly associated with developed economies. He questioned how businesses could remain competitive locally when such high legitimate tax rates are imposed, while better services and facilitation are available abroad at comparatively lower costs.
He emphasised that businesses are willing to be tax compliant, provided the system is fair and facilitative.
He further suggested non-monetary recognition mechanisms for compliant taxpayers such as recognition cards, priority facilitation at airports, and public acknowledgment stating that such measures do not impose a financial burden on the state but significantly enhance the dignity and motivation of taxpayers.
The RCCI president also presented key recommendations, including tax incentives for exporters, reduction in the corporate tax rate, and strong action against corrupt practices and harassment by lower-level staff under the guise of registration, audits, and enforcement, which create uncertainty and discourage voluntary compliance.
In her remarks, Chief Commissioner Ms Farhat Qayyum appreciated RCCI’s constructive and pragmatic recommendations for broadening the tax net and sought the Chamber’s continued cooperation in improving tax compliance and revenue collection.
She informed the participants that digitization reforms are actively underway to curb malpractices, including digital invoicing and POS system installation, aimed at enhancing transparency and minimizing human intervention.
The meeting was attended by Senior Vice President Khalid Farooq Qazi, Vice President Fahad Barlas, former RCCI Presidents Najam Rehan and Asad Mashadi, members of the Executive Committee, representatives of markets and trade associations, various business sectors, and members of the Tax Bar Association.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967024,End of stability - Dawn,"AROUND the same time last year, I wrote the economy has reached what I called “peak stability”. This was a stage where all the measures taken to stabilise the economy had delivered their results, and had now reached the end of their line. A few indicators had begun to show a little stress, but around the middle of the year, in June 2025 specifically, a large inflow of almost $5.25 billion suddenlyshoredup the reserves and allowed the government to end the fiscal year with their State Bank reserves almost $500 million above the target set in the IMF programme.
2025 saw a moderate trade deficit and surging remittances, which helped the current account balance significantly. Between January and November, the months for which data is available, the trade deficit came in around $30.5bn while remittances (including other transfers) came in at $38.8bn. Seems like a nice balance there, until you realise that something ate up $8bn out of the balance-of-payments because the overall surplus was just about $263m.
That something was interest payments on external debts. In 11 months of 2025, Pakistan paid $7.1bn in interest payments on its external debt. For almost a decade, from 2013 to 2022, this figure oscillated between $1.5bn to $4.0bn. Then it began to climb. Some of the increase was due to rising interest rates as the returns on 10-year US Treasury paper spiked from a Covid-era low of 1.44 per cent to 4.35pc in 2025. This was a sharp hike without doubt, and it weighed heavily on the balance-of-payments of all countries.
But in Pakistan’s case there was something more. In June of every year for the past few years, Pakistan has been borrowing heavily from private commercial lenders in the closing month of the fiscal year to shore up its reserves. In June 2023 and 2024, for example, they borrowed almost a billion dollars from commercial creditors. Then came June 2025 and this figure leapt to $3.4bn, nearly 65pc of the inflows of that month.
A stagnant economy cannot afford high prices, high taxes and high debt burdens for long.
The story is quite simple. Pakistan has balanced its external account by throttling its external trade, choking its economy and heavy borrowing, including private borrowing. Since 2023, for example, total private commercial borrowing by the country has been $7.5bn. It is not known what the maturity of these loans was, and therefore not possible to say how much has been retired and how much is still on the stock of total external debt now. But the scale of borrowing from private commercial lenders has increased massively in the past few years, just as the current account deficit has also diminished massively, if not disappeared altogether for many months at a stretch.
The stability in the economy cannot last much longer however. It has been earned via high taxes, a high energy price burden due to misplaced investments in the energy sector coupled with massive misgovernance. It has also been sustained through expensive borrowing, reflected at least in part by the rising burden of interest payments the economy is carrying. A stagnant economy cannot afford high prices, high taxes and high debt burdens for long.
In truth, we had hit peak stability a year ago. That was the moment to start transitioning out from stabilisation towards growth, on the back of some sort of reform agenda. But no reforms came. Nothing happened. The government was content to simply proclaim success on the back of stabilisation alone, thinking its job was done. All of 2025 was a grind, as a result, slogging ahead in a high-cost, high-tax and high-debt environment, with no end in sight.
All governments in the past have done what they are going to do in the first year or two of their tenure. Whether it was the signature reform of the federation through the 18th Amendment and the associated NFC Award in 2009 of the PPP government, or the CPEC investments and associated growth spurt of the PML-N government from 2013 to 2018, the work was largely done in the first two years, and in the latter case, took the another two years before the ribbons started being cut on the highways and power plants. The Musharraf regime spent two years stabilising the economy, and unfurled its reforms in 2002 via the telecom sector, the power reforms, and the privatisations.
But the present government has spent its first two years doing nothing discernible. And now they announce the return of MrIshaq Daras the exports czar, as the man who will be tasked with bringing about an export surge from here forward. This ought to be easy for him. During his finance ministership, Pakistan’s exports plummeted. Maybe, if he does the opposite of whatever he did while in power we will have an export surge.
By now, announcements are coming with an increasing regularity, of a new committee or a new goal being set. But it is too little, too late. By now it has become clear that this government cannot punch its way out of this paper bag. They are stuck in a gruelling adjustment, weighing heavily on the citizenry and on owners of capital alike. They have juiced this lemon for all it is worth. From here on, some sort of a vision needs to kick in. Some way to unlock the growth potential of Pakistan that is tied down by layers and layers of mismanagement, bad pricing and bad legacy. But there is nothing.
The only way they can end this economic stalemate is with some sort of bilateral or other external injection of liquidity. It was the same way the Musharraf regime did it. Except they had 9/11 as the bonanza. We wait to see what these guys will get.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967625,Basmati boom propels Pakistan past Vietnam - Dawn,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s rice exports recorded a strong rebound in December 2025, registering a 14 per cent month-on-month (MoM) increase compared to November, primarily driven by a more than 50pc surge in Basmati shipments.
The impressive performance enabled Pakistan to overtake Vietnam and emerge as the world’s third-largest rice exporter, behind India and Thailand, during the month.
According to trade data, Pakistan exported 489,000 tonnes of rice in December 2025, excluding shipments to Iran, compared to Vietnam’s 387,000 tonnes. This marks Pakistan’s best monthly rice export performance, underscoring renewed momentum in the sector.
The UAE remained the top destination for Pakistani rice, importing 74,897 tonnes, including 16,850 tonnes of Basmati. China followed closely with 74,685 tonnes, while other major destinations included Tanzania (62,900 tonnes), Kenya (60,300 tonnes), Ivory Coast (41,700 tonnes), Guinea-Bissau (31,850 tonnes), Malaysia (23,930 tonnes), Madagascar (17,800 tonnes), Kazakhstan (17,050 tonnes), Saudi Arabia (16,032 tonnes, including 5,350 tonnes of Basmati), the EU and UK combined (21,100 tonnes, including 15,600 tonnes of Basmati), Oman (5,770 tonnes), the United States (2,230 tonnes), and Canada (1,321 tonnes).
December surge boosts rankings despite structural challenges
A notable development during December was Pakistan’s growing footprint in Central Asian markets. Exports to Kazakhstan exceeded 17,000 tonnes, including 10,300 tonnes of Basmati, while shipments to Uzbekistan stood at 10,382 tonnes. Industry experts say this reflects a structural shift, as Pakistan is now exporting directly to Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Previously, much of this trade moved indirectly through Afghanistan, but the closure of the Afghan border has prompted direct export routes, making Pakistan’s presence in the region more visible.
Despite the encouraging December figures, the rice export sector continues to face deep-rooted challenges. Structural, financial, marketing, and capacity-related weaknesses persist, with one of the most significant gaps being Pakistan’s negligible exports to Iraq — currently the world’s second-largest importer of Indian Basmati rice after Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Pakistan’s exports to Turkiye, a key transit hub for Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and parts of Eastern Europe, remain minimal.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has recently directed authorities to formulate a comprehensive strategy to boost rice exports and reduce the widening trade deficit.
Government officials have attributed the downturn to low-priced Indian rice and phytosanitary rejections at borders. However, exporters argue that Pakistan’s rice sector is suffering primarily due to policy missteps.
Hamid Malik, a rice sector analyst, says the causes include intense global competition, higher global production — especially in India — weakening international demand, rising ocean freight and logistics costs, inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, irrational regulatory frameworks, inflated domestic prices caused by hoarding and undocumented money, and security-related border closures.
Amid these challenges, Malik sees several positive developments as a silver lining. “There is strong demand for Pakistani rice in Bangladesh, although higher freight costs have eroded competitiveness.”
Central Asian states are also emerging as promising markets since the start of Pakistan’s harvesting season in October 2025. Additionally, a 50pc tariff imposed by the United States on Indian rice exports has begun to benefit Pakistan, with shipments to the US gradually picking up, says Abu Bakr, an exporter.
Another significant development is unfolding in Iran, where foreign exchange shortages have led the Iranian Central Bank to stop issuing subsidised foreign exchange for rice imports. Iranian traders are now importing rice using their own funds, a shift that has favoured Pakistan due to geographic proximity. Pakistani exporters report a surge in Iranian demand, while Indian exporters have been adversely affected.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967660/failure-to-reform,Failure to reform - Dawn,"By the end of the firs quarter of the 21st century, the world had become a far more uncertain and volatile place than it was at its outset. Yet, despite conflicts, shocks and growing complexity, many countries, especially emerging economies, managed to sustain growth and make a significant dent in extreme poverty.
Pakistan also recorded progress, most notably in digitisation and connectivity. However, it has consistently underperformed relative to global peers and regional neighbours. In fact, the gap in key economic and social indicators has widened, reflecting difficulties in striking the right policy balance and restoring credibility with an increasingly anxious public and reluctant investors.
Comparable, credible and comprehensive datasets on long-term global and regional averages for key indicators such as growth and poverty are not readily accessible. Nevertheless, available online estimates consistently show Pakistan lagging not just globally but also regionally.
Over the past 25 years, South Asia averaged growth of about 5.7 per cent compared with roughly 3.7pc in Pakistan. Average poverty is estimated at around 35pc in Pakistan, versus about 20pc regionally, while per capita income remained in the $1,000–1,300 range, well below the $1,800–2,500 recorded in South Asia.
Pakistan has ample human and intellectual resources, but ad hoc decisions and weak implementation prevent these strengths from translating into sustained outcomes
Pakistan also trails behind on most economic indicators, foreign exchange reserves, exports and industrial, agricultural, and service competitiveness, as well as social outcomes such as education, gender parity, health and employment, despite rapid gains in digitisation and connectivity.
Those who argue that Pakistan’s negative outlook is deliberately exaggerated have largely failed to substantiate their claims. While opinions among experts and business leaders vary, none disputed the broad direction of the indicators; they pointed to deeper structural causes. A senior member of the government’s economic team, speaking anonymously, blamed the political preoccupation and lack of sustained focus on growth for the poor outcomes.
A former minister went further, describing the government as part of the problem rather than the solution. “The establishment has kept the economy shackled. Each time a shift towards the market is discussed, more layers of regulations and regulators are added.
“Where there was once a ministry of power, we now have Nepra [National Electric Power Regulatory Authority], Ogra [Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority], and numerous other regulators crowding out the private sector. No serious investor will commit capital as long as the state continues to interfere in business the way it does,” he said.
Dr Nadeem ul Haq, former federal minister, attributed Pakistan’s failures to a constitutional framework that entrenches winner-takes-all politics and perpetuates dynastic rule, operating through an outdated colonial governance system.
Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council, identified Pakistan’s failure to organise its economy around export competitiveness as a single overriding reason for its relative underperformance. Rather than building capacity to produce tradable goods and services on a global scale, the country relied on consumption-led growth, protected domestic markets, and recurring external borrowing. This model repeatedly triggered balance-of-payments crises, macroeconomic instability, and stop–and–go growth, deterring investment. Weak exports also translated into low-quality job creation, persistent poverty, and limited fiscal space for human development.
While digitisation has improved connectivity and service delivery, in the absence of an export-oriented strategy, it has largely fuelled consumption rather than productivity. Mr Malik argued that, aligned with competitiveness, digitisation can reduce transaction costs, link firms to global markets, enable service exports, formalise businesses, and raise productivity across industry and agriculture. Embedded in an export-led framework, it can shift growth towards jobs, resilience, and foreign-exchange earnings.
Nasim Beg, a senior executive who sits on several corporate boards, views the widening income disparity as the root of Pakistan’s problems. “We have failed to address our deep-rooted class divide, relying on the hope of trickle-down effects instead of taking direct action,” he said.
Khurram Mukhtar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association, attributed Pakistan’s underperformance to the absence of policy continuity and institutional credibility. He said frequent reversals of economic, fiscal, and industrial policies across political cycles erode investor confidence and retards long-term planning.
As a result, reforms fail to mature, incentives are distorted, compliance is penalised rather than rewarded, and the economy remains trapped in short-term stabilisation. Digitisation improves connectivity, but without predictable rules and strong institutions, it cannot deliver productivity, jobs, or inclusive growth.
Moreover, Abdul Aleem, Secretary General of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also identified the persistent lack of policy continuity as the central problem. “Pakistan has ample human, intellectual and physical resources, along with well-developed reform blueprints, but ad hoc decisions, frequent reversals, and weak implementation prevent these strengths from translating into sustained outcomes, like a powerful engine running on few cylinders.
“This inconsistency erodes state capacity and investor confidence, as businesses depend on predictability in tax regimes, energy policies, trade frameworks and regulatory frameworks. Abrupt policy shifts raise costs, deter long-term investment, and limit job creation, leaving gains such as digitisation unable to deliver broad productivity gains or inclusive growth.”
Nusair Teli, CEO of Pepsi Pakistan and a representative of the new generation of business leaders, was blunt in his assessment. He attributed Pakistan’s stalled development to chronic political instability and egregious mismanagement, arguing that the pursuit of power has displaced responsibility. “Institutions have been overburdened with political appointments, while citizens are taxed to fund them,” he said.
While acknowledging the country’s misfortune with leadership, he concluded that societies ultimately get the leaders they produce, raising a deeper question about the collective lack of will to demand and sustain better governance.
