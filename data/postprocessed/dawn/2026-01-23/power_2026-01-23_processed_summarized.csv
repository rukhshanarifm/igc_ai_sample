https://www.dawn.com/news/1967418,Power sector interventions fail to spark growth - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Despite over 35 years of ‘reforms’ and policy interventions, Pakistan’s power sector remains incapable of instilling confidence in the country’s economic growth and in consumers’ trust, leading to gains secured from power producers through renegotiations evaporating amid unending inefficiencies.
This charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship ‘State of the Industry Report 2025’, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.
It said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.
It said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, “overall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development”.
Nepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt
It pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, many go­­vernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com­me­rcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie­ncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con­tribute to the circular debt problem.
It said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. “Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector’s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth”, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector’s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.
The regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.
It appreciated the government’s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. “Consequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs’ tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms”.
On top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal.
Reduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.
A notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.
The regulator put on record that “KE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators”.
Operational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.
It said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.
As if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement drive had “been diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions”. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement efforts.

In terms of money, the losses mean a total of Rs 40 crores annually and to save these losses, experts said it involves an expenditure of Rs 40 to 50 crores, which can be recovered within two years. To avoid these losses the WAPDA and KESC are required to import capacitors, introduce integrated load dispatching system and use better conducting on transmission and distribution lines... .
Maximum energy utilisation and conservation has become a necessity in the wake of energy crisis since 1973 and consequently the Prime Minister ... approved a proposal to undertake a nationwide energy conservation and austerity campaign. Its main purpose was to minimise the wasteful uses of various forms of energy, in various sectors, and to exhort the end-consumers to maximise efficiency of energy utilisation.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967628,Failed power reform - Dawn,"NEPRA’S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.
In fact, the power sector’s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector’s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector’s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator’s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967414,RLNG price cut by up to 5pc - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Friday notified up to five per cent reduction in the price of regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) at the distribution stage for the current month, mainly due to lower international oil prices.
This is the second consecutive monthly reduction, following around a 6pc decline in December, cumulatively bringing down RLNG prices by more than 11pc over two months. Before this drop, prices had increased by 4.4pc during October and November.
Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, reported distribution-stage system losses of 12.55pc, up from 10.6pc a couple of months earlier. Meanwhile, Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), supplying gas to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported system losses of nearly 9pc at the distribution stage, compared to 7.47pc in October.
According to the notification, the RLNG sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage declined by 4.62pc to $10.41 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for January 2026, from $10.92 per mmBtu in December 2025 and $11.24 in September.
As a result, the sale price at the distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 4.68pc to $11.27 per mmBtu for January, compared to $11.83 in December and $12.24 in November.
On the other hand, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL at the transmission stage decreased by 5.25pc to $8.98 per mmBtu for January, from $9.47 in December, $10.065 in November and $9.86 in September.
The distribution-stage sale price for SSGCL was also reduced by 5.26pc to $10.21 per mmBtu for the current month, compared to $10.77 in December, $11.45 in November and $11.01 in September.
Ogra said the reduction in RLNG prices was due to a decrease in the delivered ex-ship (DES) price. Unaccounted-for gas (UFG) for both companies at the distribution stage had increased two months ago.
Ironically, the RLNG distribution prices of $10.21 per mmBtu for SSGCL and $11.27 for SNGPL are almost $3.3 and $4.25 per mmBtu higher than the average DES price, respectively.
This is mainly because both LNG importers, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL), along with port authorities, charge profit margins on account of retainage at the rate of 3.77pc of the DES price, on top of losses of 8.97pc for SNGPL and 12.55pc for SSGCL.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967807/govt-cites-weather-among-reasons-for-power-outages,Govt cites weather among reasons for power outages - Dawn,"• Leghari says electricity cuts due to fuel mismanagement, transmission constraints, among other causes• Minister contests ‘outdated’ Nepra report, says document should have been shared for ‘fact-checking’• Claims tariff dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 in December 2025
ISLAMABAD: The government on Sun­day conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8–10 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.
Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and ‘mistakes’ in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.
This resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.
The minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.
He said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.
Mr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps — both low recoveries and high losses — were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers’ money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.
The minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.
He said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.
He agreed with the Nepra’s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under ‘take or pay’ or ‘must run’ agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.
‘Without due diligence’
Responding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.
“We have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan’s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,” he said.
The minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.
He also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. “In the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,” he said.
He also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was ‘a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos’. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.
He said the Discos’ recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.
Circular debt
Contesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator’s “understanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising”.
He said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.
Most importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. “K-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric’s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.
The receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,” the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.
Responding to Nepra’s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.

A 10-member high-level Reconnaissance Mission of subject matter experts from the ADB, led by Mr Suenghyun Kim, Senior Transport Specialist, visited the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) to review existing and future port–rail connectivity and assess related logistics infrastructure.
Following earlier engagements with the government, the reconnaissance mission represents ADB’s initial step toward revitalising rail connectivity to Pakistan’s ports, a KPT press release said.
The delegation was briefed on KPT’s cargo-handling capabilities, its role as Pakistan’s maritime gateway, and the port’s strategic connectivity requirements for efficient inland cargo movement. Discussions also covered KPT’s ongoing and planned development initiatives aimed at enhancing operational efficiency, including dredging, increasing draught depth, and strengthening multimodal integration with terminal operators.
KPT Chairman retired Rear Admiral Shahid Ahmed highlighted that, at present, cargo from Karachi Port is transported by road trailers, leading to severe urban congestion and increased road safety risks due to heavy traffic.
He said KPT’s cargo-handling operations run round the clock, but the movement of trailers out of the port is restricted until after 11pm, creating a critical bottleneck in cargo transshipment.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967028,Power users to continue paying debt surcharge - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday announced that the Rs3.23 per unit debt surcharge on electricity consumers would continue for up to six years as it notified a revised uniform national base tariff for the current year without any change.
In a statement issued on the sidelines of the revised tariff notification for all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, the Power Division said the debt surcharge, currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit, would be withdrawn in five to six years once the circular debt is cleared.
“Once the circular debt is cleared, the debt surcharge currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit will be withdrawn, providing further tariff relief to consumers,” it said, adding that the government had introduced a surplus power package under which industrial and agricultural consumers can avail additional electricity at a concessional rate of Rs22.98 per unit for three years, helping reduce average industrial tariffs.
In addition, a circular debt settlement plan has been launched to eliminate outstanding debt within five to six years.
The Power Division also conceded that the growth of off-grid solar consumption had distorted subsidy requirements, with the number of protected consumers doubling from 11 million in 2021 to 22m recently due to hybrid consumption patterns.
“This has not only strained fiscal resources but has also increased the cross-subsidy burden on industrial and commercial users, undermining their competitiveness,” it said, adding that commercial, bulk supply and high-consuming domestic consumers were currently bearing a significantly higher cross-subsidy burden than the industrial sector.
Responding to criticism over higher energy costs — alsohighlightedby Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as one of the key reasons for the exit of foreign firms from Pakistan and export challenges — the Power Division said it would explore additional options to further reduce the cross-subsidy burden on industrial consumers, including subsidy reforms and debt refinancing, in addition to the tariff reduction measures already in place.
It added that data showed the industrial cross-subsidy burden had been reduced from Rs225 billion (Rs8.9 per unit) in March 2024, when the current government assumed office, to Rs102bn (Rs4.02 per unit) at present, reflecting a reduction of Rs123bn.
“Industrial electricity tariffs (including taxes) have declined from Rs62.99 per unit in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per unit in December 2025, while the national average tariff has fallen from Rs53.04 to Rs42.27 per unit,” it said.
Moreover, to reduce electricity tariffs, the government has terminated inefficient power plants and successfully renegotiated contracts with independent power producers (IPPs). These measures have resulted in tariff reductions, and further negotiations with the remaining IPPs are underway, the Power Division said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1965589,Government mulls fuel levy hike to aid gas sector - Dawn,"• Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months• Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector
ISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
While testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr­o­leum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.
The minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.
Interestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared topetrol and dieselwhich are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.
In the last week of November 2025, Ogra haddeterminedup to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra’s determination within 40 days.
The minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan hadconcludedsuccessful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac­h­ed to manage excess supplies.
MNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector’s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.
The minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been “quelled”, which was a critical reform measure.
Sui gas companies’ managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.
Committee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.
Officials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.
No domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.
The committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.
The minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.
The committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968368/water-test,Water test - Dawn,"THE world has entered what the UN has termed an era of “water bankruptcy”. The phrase is not to be sidelined as over-the-top rhetoric. In many regions, societies have been drawing down water far faster than nature can replenish. Resultantly, rivers, aquifers, glaciers and wetlands have been exhausted in ways that are no longer reversible. The UN University’s latest report warns that water systems across continents are already in a post-crisis state, where one can no longer count on recovery after a drought or flood. This global condition carries particular urgency for Pakistan — a lower-riparian, semi-arid state whose economy, food security and social stability depend overwhelmingly on the Indus basin. Climate change has intensified floods and droughts alike, accelerated glacier melt in the upper reaches of the basin, and worsened groundwater depletion across the plains. Rapid population growth, inefficient irrigation and poor urban water management have pushed demand well beyond sustainable limits. In the language of the UN report, Pakistan has been spending not just its annual “water income” but also its long-term “savings”. Against this backdrop, India’s decision to place the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance is deeply troubling. For more than six decades, the treaty provided predictability, data-sharing and dispute-resolution mechanisms in one of the world’s most heavily used transboundary river systems. Pakistan’s warning at the UN that unilateral actions and information withholding amount to the weaponisation of water should be taken seriously. In an era of water bankruptcy, uncertainty only deepens the crisis, making it harder to plan for agriculture, electricity generation and flood control.
Yet it would be a mistake to see Pakistan’s water predicament through the lens of external threats alone. Even if the treaty remains intact, the country faces an internal reckoning. Bankruptcy management, as the UN report makes clear, is not about returning to a lost past but about adapting honestly to new hydrological realities. That means rethinking crop choices, pricing and subsidies, investing in groundwater regulation and recharge, protecting ecosystems, and modernising irrigation. The coming years will be decisive. With global water risks rising and regional cooperation under strain, Pakistan must prepare for scarcity as a fact of life. Preventing a full-blown water collapse will demand diplomacy abroad, discipline at home and the political courage to act while we can.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967505,Search operation begins to locate over 50 missing people at Karachi’s Gul Plaza as fire doused after 24 hours - Dawn,"KARACHI: A search operation at Karachi’s Gul Plaza began after 10pm on Sunday evening as fire crews were finally able to douse the fire after 24 hours, with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah saying that six deaths have been confirmed, but over 50 people were reportedly missing.
According to Rescue 1122 officials, their teams had finally managed to enter the charred building to launch a search for survivors and bodies as the cooling process was still underway.
The fire, which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road, had been brought under control by about 70 per cent by late Sunday afternoon, officials said.
Speaking to the media at around 7pm, CM Murad said, “I say with utmost grief that so far, it is confirmed that six people have lost their lives, including KMC firefighter Furqan Shaukat.”
He added that 22 others were hurt and had now been discharged from hospitals as they had faced minor injuries.
“But what is very concerning […] is that around 58 people — some people even say more than 60 — are missing. May God give them more life.”
According to a list shared withDawnaround the same time, the South district office had received reports of 53 missing people from their families so far.
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
A separate statement by the South Zone police also listed the following helpline contact numbers: 021-99205670, 021-99201196 and 021-99205691.
Hundreds of people had gathered around the building today, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.
During his media talk, CM Murad noted that the mall was a three-storey building with a basement and housed more than 1,000 shops.
While the chief minister noted that the cause of the fire could not be ascertained for sure at this stage, he said a short circuit was being blamed for igniting the blaze in a shop with flammable material.
Terming it a “very upsetting” incident, he stressed that authorities were making efforts to find missing people.
The Sindh CM detailed that around 26 fire tenders, 10 bowsers and multiple snorkels took part in the fire extinguishing operations.
CM Murad, citing what he had been informed, said an alert about the fire was received at 10:16pm, and the first fire tender had reached the site at 10:27pm.
“All municipal authorities acted immediately, according to what I have been informed, and all these things will be verified.”
President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday spoke CM Murad over the telephone to inquire about the latest situation of the fire, stressing the need to use all available resources to ensure the success of rescue and firefighting operations, a statement from the President’s House said.
“The president also paid tribute to firefighter Farqan Shaukat, who lost his life in the blaze, and asked the Sindh government to nominate him for a civil award.”
He directed authorities to ensure proper medical care for the injured and take immediate steps for the rehabilitation of affected families, while emphasising strict enforcement of fire safety laws and the modernisation of safety inspection mechanisms in commercial and residential buildings to prevent similar incidents in the future.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said PM Shehbaz Sharif also inquired about the incident over the phone, offering all kinds of assistance to the provincial government from the Centre.
Pointing out that the mall was constructed in the 1980s, he said, “I admit that we could not control the deterioration that, without any study, multi-level buildings were allowed. And now if we stop them, the builders make a fuss that they are being bothered.”
He highlighted that many buildings do not have materials to extinguish fire available inside the buildings, and stressed the need for fire exits to be properly marked.
At around 4pm, South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso toldDawnthat the fire had been brought under control by up to 70pc.
Speaking toGeo News, DC Khoso said authorities were gathering information about the number of people trapped inside the building.
“We have cordoned off the area and are trying to extinguish the blazes phase-wise,” he said.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Abid Jalal toldGeo Newsin the afternoon that “firefighting is underway from all three sides”.
He also said that the fire had been brought under control by about 70-75pc. However, he stressed that the building was very dilapidated.
“The backside has collapsed, and the front area is also about to collapse.”
Terming flammable material inside the mall as the “biggest challenge” in fully dousing the blaze, COO Jalal pointed out that accessing the building was very difficult.
“Sending firefighters inside right now is not without danger,” the rescue officer said. Therefore, he added, the team’s strategy was to control the fire first and then begin the search once they were able to enter the mall.
COO Jalal detailed that over 125 people, including firefighters, were engaged in the ongoing operations and about 20-22 vehicles of the fire brigade were involved.
ADawnNewsTVcorrespondent present at the site reported that all sides of the mall had been impacted, with one having “completely collapsed”.
He added that several people had come to look for their relatives, including shopkeepers working at the mall.
Delhi Colony residents Mansoor and Jameel toldDawnNewsTVthat they were unable to contact six of their family members who had come to Gul Plaza last night for shopping.
They said their last contact was at around 10:10pm last night, after which their mobile numbers were not reachable. The missing members comprised three women, two men and a 14-year-old girl.
Speaking to the media at the site in the afternoon, Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad said the search for missing people will begin after the fire has been put out and the cooling process has been completed.
“There were goods such as crockery, clothes, electrical appliances, cosmetics and perfumes in various shops, due to which the fire intensified,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan explained.
The spokesperson added that on Sunday morning, 20 fire tenders from different departments and institutions were being employed to extinguish the blaze.
“But the building appears very old, and there is a danger that its structure may fall at any time because of the impact of the fire. Thus, the rescue operation is being carried out with extreme caution,” he said.
“When we arrived, the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames,” Khan toldReuters.
A Rescue 1122 spokesperson toldBBC Urduearly on Sunday that the fire “spread over 8,000 square yards is very intense and the process to extinguish it [fully] could take one to two days”.
Earlier in the day, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed also confirmed that six bodies and 11 injured had been brought to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) so far. State-runAPPreported that an emergency has been declared at the hospital.
In a statement run byAPP, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said “more than 17 people” had been taken to hospitals due to suffocation, several of whom were discharged after receiving medical treatment.
Noting that Gul Plaza was an old building, he said the final cause of the fire will only be known after the completion of investigations. He added that 40 snorkels were taking part in the operation.
A firefighter identified as Furqan Shoukat also lost his life during the fire-extinguishing efforts, according to a statement by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
“In this time of grief, we stand with the family of martyred Furqan and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation will provide full support to its martyred employees,” the mayor was quoted as saying byAPP.
He said teams and machinery are fully engaged in extinguishing the fire.
In a separate statement, Wahab said all municipal departments have been directed to provide full support to the victims.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate statement reported by state-runRadio Pakistan, also expressed sorrow over the firefighter’s death.
He highlighted that Furqan sacrificed his life while saving the public, and prayed for his elevated ranks.
“It appears to have been caused by a circuit breaker,” Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho told reporters at the site, noting that Gul Plaza housed around 1,200 shops and also had a basement.
“The layout and construction of this market was such, and secondly, the nature of the items in it — such as carpets, blankets and other objects made of resins — so the fire is still simmering because of these.”
Garden Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Mohsin Raza also said in a statement on Saturday night that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit at one of the shops, before spreading to the entire mall.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed officials to divert traffic in the area to alternative routes for the safe passage of citizens.
In a statement, he said that the cause of the fire should be ascertained through a thorough investigation. He said that the building should be secured so that the fire does not spread.
The minister said the routes should be cleared so that fire brigade vehicles could access the scene.
A Sindh Rangers spokesperson said in a statement that personnel had been deployed to the scene of the incident.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in rescue activities and rescue operations along with the fire brigade staff,” the statement, which was issued shortly after the fire erupted, said. “Officers and personnel will remain at the scene until the rescue operation is completed.”
The statement further read that in addition to aiding in rescue operations, a contingent of Rangers had been deployed to cordon off the building for the safety of civilians and to ensure traffic flow.
“Alongside fire tenders, Rangers personnel are evacuating trapped people and ensuring the safety of valuables,” the statement read, adding that protecting lives and preventing the fire from further spreading was a top priority.
Traders feared huge losses as their goods were reduced to ashes by the blaze.
While the estimates vary, the All City Traders Ittehad Association (ACTIA) estimated losses worth around Rs2-2.5 billion, including “repair and reconstruction costs”.
In a statement, ACTIA patron-in-chief Sharjeel Goplani said chairman Zahid Amin and other members of the association had conducted an assessment of the affected mall.
Addressing the Sindh government and the prime minister, Goplani said, “Currently, 1,200 traders have suffered losses. This should be compensated immediately.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz expressed their deep grief over the fire at Gul Plaza and the resulting loss of lives.
In a statement reported byAPP, the premier instructed that all possible assistance should be provided to the affected traders and other individuals, and that all necessary facilities should be provided to the injured.
He stressed that all relevant departments should work together in the rescue operation.
In his statement, President Zardari directed that the Sindh government — which is of his PPP — and the relevant authorities “provide immediate and every possible assistance to the affected people and the traders”.
“No stone should be left unturned in providing the best medical facilities to the injured,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Memon, in a statement reported byAPP, said the Sindh government will decide the future course of action after a complete assessment of the losses.
The minister said that whether it is the trader community or other affected individuals, the government will make every effort to provide maximum possible assistance within the framework of law and regulations.
Taking notice of the incident, CM Murad issued orders to Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi for an immediate inquiry into the matter and to prepare a report on the cause of the fire.
CM Murad was briefed about the incident earlier in the day at the CM House by Commissioner Naqvi and DC Khoso, who informed him that the fire broke out between 9:45pm and 10:15pm.
“The fire safety arrangements in the building should be inspected,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement.
He ordered the strict implementation of fire safety rules and action against those whose negligence or carelessness would be proven.
“A fire safety audit should immediately be conducted of Karachi’s commercial buildings,” CM Murad said.
According to the briefing, more than 1,200 shops were gutted in the incident. A massive emergency response was launched, involving 22 fire brigade vehicles, 10 water bowzers, four snorkel vehicles, and 33 Rescue 1122 ambulances.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed CM Murad and Wahab to deploy all resources to control the fire.
Expressing grief over the loss of lives and property, he demanded an immediate probe into the blaze and ordered that steps be taken to prevent such future tragedies.
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah visited the site of the incident earlier in the day to assess the rescue operations.
The South deputy commissioner and Rescue 1122 officials briefed him on the steps taken to control the fire.
The chief secretary issued orders for the deployment of all available fire tenders and additional rescue workers.
Soon after the fire began, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had also visited Gul Plaza, where he was briefed on the rescue and relief operations.
Standing alongside the traders whose shops were ablaze, the governor issued directives for the rehabilitation of the affected.
Prior to his visit, in a statement from his office, Tessori expressed concern over the incident and ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations.
He also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.
Gul Plaza has witnessed fire incidents in the past as well.
InAugust 2016, more than 25 shops were burnt in a huge fire that broke out in the multi-storey market. It was believed that a short circuit caused the fire.
A fire at a warehouse in Gul Plaza inAugust 2008, also caused by an electric short-circuit, destroyed some goods. However, no casualty was reported.
Fires frequentlyeruptin buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
At a conference in October 2025 followingmultiplefireincidents, city planners, fire experts and disaster management authorities raisedserious concernsover the deteriorating state of fire preparedness in Karachi.
They urged authorities to take immediate action to align the metropolis’s fire safety systems with international standards, warning that the current state leaves the city dangerously exposed to large-scale emergencies.
In December, the Sindh Assemblyvoted unanimouslyin favour of an opposition-sponsored resolution that called for the comprehensive modernisation of Karachi’s inadequate and substandard firefighting system.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968550,Business costs 34pc higher than region - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The cost of doing business in Pakistan is about 34 per cent higher than in regional economies, creating a serious competitiveness crisis for local industry, a business group said on Thursday.
In a statement, the Pakis­tan Business Forum (PBF) said higher operating costs had “severely undermined” the ability of local industries to compete in international markets.
It said that due to irrational taxation, excessive energy costs and currency instability, Pakist­an’s exporters were unable to match regional competitors, resulting instagnantexports since 2022 despite global trade recovery in several sectors.
PBF Chairman Ahmad Jawad said that in the given scenario, Pakistani businesses were struggling to survive, let alone expand exports, as their cost structures remain misaligned with regional economies such as Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.
Mr Jawad emphasised that to address this alarming situation, Pakistan must immediately rationalise its taxation system, reduce the cost of electricity and gas for industry and adopt a clear policy aimed at strengthening and stabilising the rupee.
PBF warns of competitiveness crisis, calls for tax, energy reforms
He said the rupee should be stabilised at Rs240 per dollar, saying that a stronger and more predictable exchange rate would help curb inflation, lower imported raw material costs, and bring stability to export orders. He recalled that continuous devaluation had failed to boost exports and had instead fuelled inflation, increased production costs and eroded business confidence.
The PBF noted with disappointment that over the last six years, the rupee had devalued by nearly Rs160 against the dollar, a situation that reflected poor economic management rather than market fundamentals.
“For the time being, the rupee is holding its position, but when we look at the country’s foreign exchange reserves, the current dollar price against the rupee is still excessively high and not truly market-driven,” Mr Jawad said, adding that artificial devaluation had only benefited speculative elements while damaging productive sectors of the economy.
Highlighting the crisis in the cotton sector, PBF Chairman for South and Central Punjab Malik Talat Suhail expressed grave concern over theclosureof more than 400 cotton ginning factories, which had disrupted the entire cotton value chain and negatively impacted farmers, ginners and the textile industry.
Mr Sohail said cotton ginners were not being provided with a level playing field due to the unjustified imposition of 18pc GST on local cottonseed and oil cake, which had increased costs and reduced demand for local cotton, ultimately causing financial losses to farmers.
He said cotton was one of the most important components of Pakistan’s import bill, and removing the 18pc GST on cotton seed and oil cake would significantly encourage cotton cultivation in Punjab and Sindh, reduce dependency on imports and help revive the domestic cotton economy.
He urged the government to take immediate action and issue an SRO for the withdrawal of GST on cottonseed and oil cake by February, as early cotton harvesting begins by the end of next month.
He stressed that without timely policy intervention, Pakistan risks further decline in cotton production, continued closure of ginning factories and increased pressure on foreign exchange reserves.
The PBF warned that failure to implement urgent structural reforms will lead to long-term deindustrialisation, loss of export markets, rising unemployment and dee­per economic instability.
It also called upon the federal government to engage with stakeholders and adopt pro-business, pro-export, and pro-farmer policies to restore competitiveness, revive exports and place Pakistan’s economy back on a sustainable growth path.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967278,Difficult times - Dawn,"IQBAL works as a driver with a rent-a-car company. He is usually working six to seven days a week. The company pays him around Rs30,000 as salary. He does make some more as overtime, and though that amount varies by the month, on average he gets another Rs20,000 or so. Adding tips to the total, he makes around Rs65,000 per month. He has a wife and two children who are still in school.
Up to a couple of years ago, Iqbal was able to save a bit every month from his income. But the inflation over the last few years has made his budget a lot more constrained. He is barely able to meet all his routine expenses now. Electricity and gas bills have increased a lot. And the food bill has also almost doubled. He is actively on the lookout for extra driving jobs now so that he can get more overtime payment. He has started skipping lunch unless a client is generous enough to give him lunch or money for lunch.
This is not an isolated case. In their article (‘People are eating less’) in this paper last week, Zafar Mirza and Miftah Ismail, giving numbers from the Household Integrated Expenditure Survey 2024-25, have shown that people are indeed eating less and they have had to tighten their belts further to make ends meet. And this is true for not just lower-income groups but middle-income groups as well.
What has made life a lot harder for Iqbal and his family has been a health shock. His wife has blood pressure and diabetes and has recently been diagnosed with some liver ailment. Doctor’s fee, expenses for diagnostic testing and regular costs of medicines have pushed Iqbal into debt. He has been forced to borrow from his relatives, friends and any clients he felt would be kind enough to help him or lend him money.
We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generation opportunities.
Each month is a struggle now. Medical expenses are a constant addition to his monthly expenses, but his income has not gone up and there does not seem to be any prospect of income growth either. He has essentially fallen into a debt trap. He has accumulated a significant amount of debt, which there is little possibility of paying, and has no ability to raise further debt. But monthly expenses continue to be higher than his income.
What is a person like Iqbal supposed to do?
This is not the story of just one household in Pakistan. It is the story of a significant proportion of the population of the country. If people have no savings, shocks can be devastating and can push households into debt and poverty. The most common shock seems to be health shocks. For a household of five to six people — the norm in Pakistan — with one or two earners, and with grandparents and children, health shocks are not a surprise at all.
Diabetes, blood pressure, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and many other ailments — a lot of them requiring medium- to long-term and continued care — are quite common in Pakistan. With 40 per cent or so of children afflicted with malnutrition, youngsters falling ill is not unexpected either.
The state does not provide good healthcare facilities. Public sector provision is not only patchy and of poor quality in general, it is also not available everywhere. And private healthcare is expensive. Whenever Iqbal has taken his wife to the public hospital, he has been told to get diagnostic tests done from private laboratories and he has also had to pay for all the medicines. Only the doctor’s fee is subsidised by the state. But diagnostic tests are quite expensive. Medicines, too, are expensive and have become even more costly over the last few years.
Do bear in mind that we do not provide any income support through our social protection institutions and programmes to those who are above very low-income levels. The Benazir Income Support Programme is for the very poor and does not extend beyond. There are no programmes for the working or low-income poor.
What could be the way out for Iqbal? Can he increase his income? He could try to work more hours. That is not easy though. He could pull out one or more of his children from school and push them into the workforce. But given the unemployment rates in the country, this is not much of an option, especially if the children are still in the early to middle stages of their education. And the loss in terms of a child not completing his or her education is seen in the medium- to long-term damage to the country.
It is at the level of the state that we can actually change things. In fact, it is the responsibility of the state to do so. A large proportion of Pakistanis have fallen on hard times, even a larger proportion has become more vulnerable to shocks than before. It is the responsibility of the state to do something about this. It is here, even in terms of intentions, that we do not find anything. We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generating opportunities for people. And we need to think about extending support to those who are falling on hard times. Probably the best way to do this — and this is being done and has been done in many countries — is to extend health and education facilities of decent quality to all citizens, especially those who are struggling. This could help a lot of people in major ways. But, of course, in an elitist and elite-captured state, this will not happen easily. It will require a major overhaul of the governance system and governance ethos in the country. This, at least for now, does not seem to be on the horizon.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967568,"Mbappe, Asencio strike as Real calm storm with Levante win - Dawn","MADRID: Real Madrid ended a turbulent week with a much-needed 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Levante on Saturday, courtesy of second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio, after being met with boos from a restless Bernabeu crowd before the breakthrough arrived.
The win snapped Real’s two-match losing run and offered brief respite after a bruising week. They looked flat in the first half, still carrying the scars of Sunday’s 3-2 Spanish Super Cup final defeat to rivals Barcelona, followed by the departure of manager Xabi Alonso the next day and a shock 3-2 Copa del Rey exit to second-division Albacete on Wednesday.
Boos greeted the players at kick-off, with sections of the crowd also directing chants at club president Florentino Perez. Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week.
Real finally eased the tension when Adrian de la Fuente tripped Mbappe in the box, and the French forward, was spared the jeers, converted the penalty in the 58th minute to extend his league-leading tally to 19 goals.
Mbappe, who appeared in pain in the warm up after a collision with team-mate Dean Huijsen, had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.
Seven minutes later, Real doubled their advantage through centre-back Asencio, who rose to meet Arda Guler’s corner with a powerful header to make it 2-0 in the 65th minute, giving new coach Alvaro Arbeloa a crucial cushion and settling the mood inside the stadium.
“Today was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,” Asencio told Real Madrid TV. “What happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better. The team gave a good account of themselves, above all in the second half. He [Arbeloa] asks us to enjoy ourselves -- to be protagonists, to  dominate, to focus on ourselves and not on the opposition. Little by  little, we’ll get there.”
The win keeps Real second in La Liga on 48 points from 20 matches, one behind leaders Barcelona, who have a game in hand and visit Real Sociedad on Sunday. Levante are 19th with 14 points.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967836,"High-speed train collision in Spain kills 39, injures dozens - Dawn","A high-speed train derailed and was hit by another in southern Spain killing 39 people and injuring more than 120, authorities said Monday, saying the country’s worst train crash in over a decade was “extremely strange”.
It was the deadliest train accident since 2013, when 80 people died after a train veered off a curved section of track outside the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela.
The crash happened on Sunday evening when a train operated by rail company Iryo travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed near Adamuz, crossing onto the other track where it crashed into an oncoming train, which also derailed.
The interior ministry said at least 39 people died, raising the toll from 21 given by police late on Sunday.
Another 123 people were injured, including five very seriously and 24 seriously, a ministry spokesperson added.
Transport Minister Oscar Puente told reporters the disaster took place on a straight part of the track, which was completely renovated.
The first train to derail was “practically new”, making the accident “extremely strange”, he added.
The death toll is not final, Puente said Monday, indicating it could rise from the current figure.
“The death toll has already reached 39 and is not definitive. I want to express my deepest gratitude for the tremendous work of the rescue teams throughout the night, under very difficult circumstances,” he wrote on X.
Rail experts “are very surprised by this accident because it is very strange and very difficult to explain at this stage,” the minister said.
Rail operator Iryo said around 300 people were on board its Malaga-Madrid service.
Renfe, the operator of the second train, has not said how many passengers it was carrying.
Spain has Europe’s largest high-speed rail network, with more than 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles) of dedicated tracks connecting major cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia, and Malaga.
The hundreds of passengers left in the wreckage hampered the frantic work of emergency services.
“The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,” Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Cordoba, told public broadcasterRTVE.
“We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,” he added.
Some of the carriages had tumbled down an embankment of four metres (13 feet), Sanz said.
A passenger on the second train, bound for the city of Huelva, who gave only her first name Montse, told Spanish public television the train, “with a jolt, came to a complete stop, and everything went dark”.
She described being thrown around in the last carriage and seeing luggage tumble on other passengers.
“The attendant behind me hit her head and was bleeding. There were children crying,” she added. “Luckily, I was in the last car. I feel like I was given a second chance at life.”
Survivor Lucas Meriako, who was travelling on the first train that derailed, told La Sexta television that “this looks like a horror movie”.
“We felt a very strong hit from behind and the feeling that the whole train was about to collapse, break… there were many injured due to the glass,” he said.
High-speed services between Madrid and the Andalusian cities of Cordoba, Seville, Malaga and Huelva would be suspended on Monday, Adif announced.
“Today is a night of deep pain for our country owing to the tragic rail accident in Adamuz,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967821,Gul Plaza inferno death toll rises to 23; Karachi mayor says 65 people remain missing - Dawn,"KARACHI: The death toll from theGul Plaza blazerose to at least 23 on Monday, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab saying that 65 people remained missing.
The fire haderuptedon Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
While the fire at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
In the evening, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza toldDawnthat 23 bodies had been recovered from the debris. He added that the body parts of some of the victims had been recovered.
In a statement, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal said that while “more than 20 bodies have been recovered, the final number of dead cannot be stated at the moment”.
“Some bodies have been recovered in the form of body parts from various locations,” he said.
“Until it is determined through a technical and forensic verification whether these parts are of the same person or different people, confirming the correct number [of deaths] is difficult.”
Mohammed Shah, who was supervising Pakistan Navy’s fire brigade team at the spot, toldDawnon Monday evening that the fire had been controlled but smoke was still emanating from the site.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson, Hassaanul Haseeb Khan toldDawnthat flames were controlled to a large extent on Sunday night, which paved the way for the cooling process. He said a search operation was initiated at three different spots.
Karachi Additional IG Azad Khan told the media gathered at the scene that no evidence had emerged thus far suggesting arson.
Speaking onGeo News’ ‘Capital Talk’, Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah also said that the Sindh government was ready to form a judicial commission to probe the incident.
Speaking onGeo Newsprogramme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that the tally thus far showed that 65 people were missing.
“Others are saying there are 77 missing but I can confirm that it is 65,” Wahab said. “Of those 65, we have retrieved and identified 18 bodies. We have retrieved other bodies but they have not been identified; we are waiting on DNA,” he said.
He said that firefighting operations had concluded and cooling work was ongoing.
“We have been able to access three areas of the building: we can enter two areas where the structure is still standing, and one portion in the rear that collapsed,” Wahab said.
The mayor added that until last night, reports of movement were received but when those areas were accessed by rescuers, there were no signs of life.
He said that rescue workers had been told to be mindful of this and instructed to drill with caution.
Asked about which institutions were responsible, the mayor said that assigning responsibility was not the primary focus at the moment. He said that an inquiry committee had been formed to ascertain the facts.
He said that 1,200 shops were active in the plaza. “Over the years, naturally, problems emerged which need to be investigated for negligence,” he said.
Meanwhile, addressing a press conference with representatives of the business community earlier in the day, Sindh CM Murad announced Rs10 million in compensation for each deceased person’s family.
“There can be no price tag for a person’s life. Their grief cannot be compensated in any way, but we are announcing Rs10m from the government for each person who lost their life,” the Sindh CM said, adding that the process would begin tomorrow (Tuesday).
“Unfortunately, there has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident,” he said. While he refrained from giving a specific number, he said that it could possible be 80.
“We are all sorrowful. We all share their grief,” the chief minister said, referring to the bereaved families.
He also announced that an inquiry committee was being set up to probe the incident, headed by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi.
He asserted that the inquiry’s aim was not to point blame but to acknowledge and correct one’s mistakes.
However, he added, “If there is any evidence of sabotage, then obviously action will be taken [although] there is no such thing as of now.”
Detailing the ongoing rescue operations, the Sindh CM said rescue personnel had carved out “three ways” to enter the building.
He said 40 per cent of the mall’s building had collapsed, adding that the rest of it was also in a poor state. “Perhaps, we might need to demolish the entire building,” he feared.
CM Murad also expressed the Sindh government’s desire to rehabilitate the affected businesses and make them functional again.
Recalling his meeting with the business community earlier in the day, he said they discussed the short-term and long-term plan of action.
The chief minister recalled the fire incidents atBolton Marketin 2009 — where the federal government’s aid was also sought — and atTimber Marketin 2014, where traders were compensated.
In the long-term, CM Murad said, local disaster management authorities will be strengthened and equipped better.
He went on to identify one of the problems, saying that the rescue authorities were not able to “perform their duties freely” and requesting “everyone not to provide their expertise”.
“All of us sitting in this room were involved in that hindrance,” the chief minister said, adding that officials could have inefficiencies.
Responding to a question, he said, “There was a [shortage] of water and there were some difficulties […] I do not want to elaborate [but] the difficulties were that people had blocked the routes, which I also hold myself accountable for.”
Stressing that the authorities were trying to account for the missing, CM Murad said, “I request each institution that considers it has the expertise to help us, to support us.”
Taking note of suggestions to seek external help, the chief minister said, “One does not need to call at such occasions. [They] need to come forward on their own.”
During his press conference, CM Murad detailed that a separate committee had been formed to assess traders’ losses and make recommendations regarding businesses’ rehabilitation.
The committee includes Zubair Motiwala, Jawed Bilwani, Idress Memon, Junaid Makda and Rehan Hanif.
The chief minister said it was decided to allocate a space temporarily to the affected businesses.
The Sindh CM said shopkeepers’ associations will be asked to install fire alarms, stressing that the first “one to two hours” after a fire occurs were crucial.
Prior to the press conference, CM Murad had held a meeting with representatives of the traders’ community where he vowed to immediately rehabilitate the affected businesses.
“We will reconstruct the building of Gul Plaza,” he announced, according to a statement from his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.
“The Sindh government will have a forensic report conducted so the cause of the fire can be known,” CM Murad said, adding that the chief secretary would notify the fact-finding committee.
Highlighting that President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were repeatedly contacting him about the incident, the chief minister said, “The PPP leadership wants the traders of Gul Plaza to be rehabilitated urgently.”
Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah said the restoration efforts would be undertaken with the advice of the traders.
Commissioner Naqvi informed the meeting that the death toll could surge to over 50. CM Murad, after being told that the cooling process was underway, ordered that the work to clear the rubble be initiated right away.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab briefed the chief minister that 16 fire tenders and bowsers were involved in the dousing operations, in which “50 to 60” firefighters participated.
He further said that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) had provided tankers and 431,000 gallons of water for the fire-extinguishing operations.
CM’s aide Giyan Chand Essarani informed the meeting that the blaze erupted at 10:36pm on January 17, adding that Rescue 1122 ambulances reached the site within six minutes.
He further said that a total of 24 fire rescue vehicles took part in the operations, including those of KMC and the Pakistan Navy.
The Sindh government also established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, said that the incident had now “turned into a national tragedy”.
“Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said.
He further stated that while determining the cause of the fire was necessary, the priority for now was to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders.
Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated.
“My cousin was inside,” said Raheel Ibrahim about Naveed Juma, who he said used to work at a shop on Gul Plaza’s first floor.
“His phone was ringing till 12am [on Saturday] but he did not receive calls,” he said, adding that his cousin’s phone was unreachable afterwards.
“Till now there is no news of him,” Ibrahim said, adding that his 43-year-old cousin had three young daughters.
Another elderly man from the Metroville area said his daughter, daughter-in-law and sister had come to the mall for shopping on Saturday.
“We have had no contact with them after 8pm that night,” he added.
The distraught man lamented, “Wherever we go, they push us away like a football that ‘ask so and so, we do not know anything’.”
Noting that some bodies were unidentifiable and needed DNA samples for cross-matching, the man said he was being told that details about that process would take two to three days.
In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza.
The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower.
Commuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or Mazar-i-Quaid from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal Market, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road.
United Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriot said she was “heartbroken” by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza.
“May strength be with the community at this time,” she said.
The Turkish Embassy in Islamabad said it was “deeply saddened”.
“The Turkish Embassy stands in solidarity with friendly and brotherly people of Pakistan in this difficult time,” it said, conveying condolences to the bereaved families.
The Russian Embassy also expressed its “heartfelt condolences and profound sorrow” over the fire incident, as well as the recent Sargodha and Ormaratraffic accidents.
The German Consulate in Karachi, in a post on X, said the incident at Gul Plaza was deeply saddening. “Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, and those injured.”
The French embassy in Pakistan expressed “profound sorrow over the loss of many lives in the devastating fire”.
“We offer our sincere condolences to the bereaved families and stand with the people of Pakistan in this moment of grief,” the embassy said on X.
The terrifyingfirethat erupted at Gul Plaza on Saturday night could have been contained sooner, but thedelayed responseand limited resources from the authorities allowed the blaze to rage unchecked for hours.
Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.
Shopkeepers at the site toldDawnthat if the firefighting team had arrived with full force and resources, the scene would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.
A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967975/pakistan-posts-12bn-cad-in-july-dec,Pakistan posts $1.2bn CAD in July-Dec - Dawn,"KARACHI: Pakistan posted a current account deficit (CAD) of $1.174 billion during the first half of 2025-26 compared with a surplus of $957 million in the same period last year, the State Bank said on Monday.
The government has projected a CAD of around $2.1bn, or within 0-1 per cent of GDP, for FY26, anticipating higher imports driven by economic growth.
Experts believe the changing geopolitical situation could disrupt oil prices, putting pressure on Pakistan’s balance of payments as the country relies entirely on imported oil. They warn that any renewed conflict in the Middle East, such as an attack on Iran, could suddenly affect supply chains and push oil prices higher. Rising oil prices would further worsen the country’s current account imbalance.
The State Bank and the government believe that higher imports contribute to the current account deficit, with oil accounting for the largest share of imports. In FY25, the country spent $15bn on petroleum product imports out of total imports of $59bn. Despite these imports, the current account recorded a surplus of $2bn.
Swelling trade deficit driven by higher imports turns current account red
On Monday, international crude oil prices ranged between $59 and $63 per barrel and remained volatile amid fears of a possible attack on Iran.
According to the SBP data, the current account posted a surplus of $98 million in November, but turned into a deficit of $244m in December. Both quarters of the current fiscal year recorded deficits: $737m during July-September and $437m during October-December.
Although the State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves have improved during the current financial year, they remain insufficient to cover petroleum imports for the entire year. During the first half of FY26, the country spent $7.1bn on petroleum product imports, compared to $7.3bn in the same period of FY25.
The government has set an export target of $60bn over three years, but exports depend 35 to 40pc on imported inputs. Weak manufacturing activity and declining cotton production have increased the import bill. Pakistan imported cotton worth $2.3bn in FY25, and production has declined again this year, indicating that more dollars will be required to boost exports. The textile sector remains the largest source of export earnings.
The current account surplus in FY25 helped stabilise market sentiment and the exchange rate, preventing panic in the dollar market.
The trade deficit widened from $14.5bn to $19.2bn in the first half of FY26, sending a clear signal about future trends. Apart from concerns over higher oil prices, the import bill is expected to continue rising as low GDP growth has increased pressure on the government. The government has been held responsible over the past three years for low GDP growth, which has pushed about 46pc of the population below the poverty line.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968228,Japan restarts world’s biggest nuclear plant 15 years after Fukushima disaster - Dawn,"The world’s biggest nuclear power plant was restarted on Wednesday for the first time since the2011 Fukushima disaster, its Japanese operator said, despite persistent safety concerns among residents.
The plant was “started at 19:02”, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) spokesman Tatsuya Matoba toldAFPof the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata prefecture.
The regional governor approved the resumption last month, although public opinion remains sharply divided.
On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters — mostly elderly — braved freezing temperatures to demonstrate in the snow near the plant’s entrance, whose buildings line the Sea of Japan coast.
“It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, toldAFP.
Around 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September.
TEPCO said on Wednesday it would “proceed with careful verification of each plant facility’s integrity” and address any issues appropriately and transparently.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.
The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.
However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.
Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source.
Fourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.
Nearly 15 years after the disaster, “the situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that’s absolutely unacceptable”, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator.
The vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades.
However, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate.
“I think it’s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,” Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, toldAFP.
On January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority.
The petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.
“We can’t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,” it said.
“Making many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo … is intolerable.” Before the 2011 disaster — which killed around 18,000 people — nuclear power generated about a third of Japan’s electricity.
Japan’s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks.
At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test.
“Safety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,” TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with theAsahidaily newspaper.
Japan is the world’s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.
Nearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil — a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power.
Under a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan’s energy supply by 2040 — up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24.
Meanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.","Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:45:21 GMT",,"Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967315,"FPCCI warns against widespread textile factory closures, unemployment amid high energy tariffs, taxes - Dawn","The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) on Friday warned that Pakistan’s industrial sector was facing asevere crisisdue to high energy tariffs and heavy taxation, leading to widespread factory closures and job losses.
In December, it wasreportedthat over 100 spinning mills and over 400 ginning factories had become non-operational, triggered by unprecedented taxes, high power tariffs, and a surge in under-invoiced cotton yarn and fabric imports from China and other countries.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, President FPCCI Atif Ikram Sheikh said, “Costly electricity has crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector.”
“Around 150 large textile units had shut down over the past two years,” he stated.
Sheikh urged the government to immediately abolish cross-subsidies imposed on the industrial sector and reduce the policy rate to single digits.
He proposed thatinterest ratesbe cut first to nine per cent and subsequently to seven per cent to revive industrial growth and investment.
Trader and business leader SM Tanvir said that the situation had also been highlighted in the World Economic Forum’s 2026 report, which increased Pakistan’s risk rating.
“According to the report,” he said, “The business activity and employment opportunities in the country are declining, while the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector has been reduced to a junkyard.”
Tanvir criticised tax policies, saying “non-filers face no scrutiny when depositing money in banks, but are heavily taxed”. “It appears the Federal Board of Revenue is working to please banks,” he alleged.
FPCCI officials warned that if the government failed to urgently address the issue of expensive electricity, the industrial sector could come to a “standstill”.
The officials criticised the government and the Power Division for not passing the relief of reduction in electricity tariff to the industrial consumers.
Recently, after NEPRA determined areductionin the base tariff of electricity, the power division maintained that the number of domestic consumersavailingsubsidised rates was very high.
They emphasised that there was additional electricity available in the country, but the capacity charges for unused power units were paid by the citizens of the country.
Furthermore, they highlighted that the industrial tariff was around 12.5 cents per unit in Pakistan, whereas it was around 7.5 cents in India.
They appealed to the prime minister to “remove the industry from the ventilator” and reduce taxes on the export sector to prevent further economic decline.
According to ananalysis, Pakistan’s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed.
It further said that high and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation.","Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:35:37 GMT",,"The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) warned that Pakistan’s industrial sector was facing asevere crisis.

Authorities said the fire, which erupted on Saturday night, was almost contained after 24-hour-long efforts. A search operation was underway amid fears of further casualties at the time of going to press.
Officials initially suspected an electrical short-circuit, but said the cause was yet to be confirmed.
The fire spread rapidly, fuelled by combustible mat­erial stored in around 1,200 shops in the ground-plus-three-storey building, spr­ead over 8,000 square yards.
On Sunday, hundreds of people had gathered aro­und the building, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.
Parts of the building collapsed during the firefighting operation. Tra­ders’ bodies estimated financial losses of up to Rs25 billion and claiming that 5,000 people worked in the shops.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the fire and fix responsibility.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that six men, aged in their 20s and 30s, were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. Post-mortem examinations were conducted and the cause of death was declared inhalation injuries and burns, she said.
Moreover, 26 men, aged 18 to 45, were brought for treatment, with 11 suffering burn injuries, she said, adding that all were discharged after first aid as none of them had suffered critical injuries.
She said “mass disaster protocols” had been activated at hospitals after officials provided a list of missing persons, including women and children, and warned that the death toll could rise.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hass­a­anul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that they received the initial call at around 1:38am on Sunday. He said rescuers were first told the fire started in a shop dealing in artificial flowers on the ground floor before spreading to the basement and upper levels.
He said the building housed shops containing clothing, plastic goods, suitcases and chemicals used for perfumes and cosmetics, while the top level had a roof and parking area.
Rescue teams, including those from Rescue 1122, the Karachi Met­ropolitan Corporation fire brigade, Pakistan Navy and the Karachi Port Trust, rescued around 50 people safely on Saturday-Sunday night, he said.
Another 20 people were rescued in injured condition, but three later died. Mr Khan said two bodies were recovered from debris late on Sunday night, while a 25-year-old firefighter, Furqan Ali, lost his life when part of the building collapsed and debris fell on him.
He said the intensity of the blaze had weakened the pillars, and the rear portion of the building had already collapsed, with the remaining half of the structure at risk.
Quoting Sindh Building Control Authority officials, he said the building was constructed in the 1990s and an additional floor was added in 2003.
59 missing; Rs25bn losses
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police had a list of 59 missing persons. “So far, we have shortlisted seven of them based on their call details,” he said, adding that their phones were last traced to the plaza before being switched off.
Sindh Chief Minister Shah, Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, IGP Javed Alam Odho and other senior officials visited the site and reviewed the rescue operation.
Meanwhile, All City Tajir Ittehad, an alliance of traders’ bodies, said in a statement that its representatives estimated losses of Rs20bn to Rs25bn, including the value of goods and reconstruction costs.
“This is not only the destruction of a building but a source of livelihood for thousands,” it said, insisting that over 5,000 people worked in more than 1,200 shops.
President, PM grieve
President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday expressed sorrow over the death of firefighter Furqan Ali, praising his bravery and offering condolences to the bereaved family, according to a statement from the President’s Secretariat. He stressed that fire safety and emergency res­p­onse systems should be strengthened to prevent such tragedies in the future.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the loss of life and directed authorities to take all possible steps to protect lives and property. “The affected traders and other victims would be provided with every possible assistance,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also spoke to the Sindh chief minister by phone to express sorrow over the loss of lives and offered the Centre’s full support to the provincial government.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968045,Power generation rises in December - Dawn,"Pakistan recorded 8,488 gigawatt-hours of power generation in December 2025, marking a nine per cent increase compared to the same month last year, according to data released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
Output in December also saw an increase of 5pc compared with November levels, but remained well below the peaks recorded in the summer months of last year.
The average cost of electricity generation climbed to Rs9.6 per kilowatt-hour in December, up 2pc from the same month last year and 56pc higher than November.
JS Research attributes this increase to a decline in hydropower generation in December. Hydropower generation fell 51pc in the month compared to November. Hydropower contributed 18pc to the energy mix during the month, forcing reliance on more expensive thermal sources. These patterns are expected during the winter months.
December’s electricity generation mix was dominated by coal (24pc) and nuclear (25pc), followed by RLNG (17pc). Coal generation saw an increase of 125pc compared to the same month last year, while nuclear output posted modest growth of 3pc.
The data shows the government’s shift away from furnace oil, traditionally the most expensive source of power generation. Furthermore, renewable sources, including wind, solar, and bagasse, accounted for 1.9pc, 0.9pc, and 1.1pc of the total mix, indicating limited penetration of clean energy in the national grid.","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:07:49 GMT",,"Pakistan recorded 8,488 gigawatt-hours of power generation in December 2025.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967983,Grid issues behind costly power: Nepra - Dawn,"• Transmission system suffers from overloading, underutilisation• 116 of 192 transformers overloaded beyond 80pc capacity• Regulator urges fast-tracking projects, upgrading substations• Says up to 1,750MW of cheaper power frequently curtailed
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s nati­onal transmission system, one of the largest in the world, suffers from a damaging mix of overloading and underutilisation, creating operational constraints that unde­rmine merit-based power supply and impose an unquantifiable financial burden on consumers and the national economy, the National Electric Power Regul­atory Authority (Nepra) has said.
In a detailed review of the national grid system, the regulator pointed out that the backbone of the transmission network — 500kV and 220kV lines — remained “mostly overloaded” at the close of FY2024-25. It said the National Grid Company (NGC) faced critical overloading in several sections of its 500kV and 220kV network, particularly during summer peak demand.
“Many grid stations and power transformers are operating beyond 80 per cent of their rated capacity, risking equipment failure, voltage instability and outages,” it said. In FY25, out of 192 transformers across 68 grid stations, 116 were overloaded beyond 80pc, it added.
Providing a breakdown, Nepra said 30 of 47 transformers at the 500/220kV level were overloaded beyond 80pc. In addition, 86 of 145 transformers at the 220/132kV level were overloaded beyond the same threshold.
Regions with notable overloading included Hyderabad, Islamabad, Lahore and Multan, with persistent constraints at key grids like Gatti, New Multan, Sarfaraz Nagar, Muzaffargarh and Sheikhupura.
“These limitations have led to reliance on expensive generation in violation of economic merit order (EMO) and rising project costs due to delays,” it said.
Ironically, most of these grid stations at Rawat, Sheikhupura, Gatti, Multan, Yousafwala, Jamshoro and Muzaffargarh have been in an overloaded condition since 2017-18 and onwards.
According to the review, these constraints have limited full power evacuation from the 1,300MW Sahiwal coal-fired plant, overreliance on Attock, Halmore, Sapphire and Liberty, limited transformation capacity in the south-central corridor and aggravated bidirectional power flows in the network.
The regulator called for fast-tracking the completion of critical transmission projects, upgrading existing substations with higher-capacity transformers and reactive power support, and enhancing real-time grid monitoring to address persistent overloading in the transmission network.
It said the resulting financial burden could not be calculated under current conditions because assessing the severity and duration of overloading would require hourly digitised operational data to determine how long a transformer or circuit operated beyond its rated capacity.
The regulator warned that transmission system constraints significantly impact the overall efficiency, reliability and affordability of electricity supply. When the transmission network lacks adequate capacity or flexibility, it restricts the flow of power from generation sources to demand centres.
“This leads to congestion, increased transmission losses and underutilisation of low-cost or renewable generation, ultimately raising the overall cost of electricity,” Nepra said.
“Transmission constraints not only raise reliability concerns for consumers but also lead to higher electricity tariffs. This is primarily because, in the absence of adequate transmission capacity, the system must rely on more expensive and less efficient power generation sources, even when cheaper alternatives are available but inaccessible,” it explained.
It said that one of the key challenges in the country’s power sector was the persistent inadequacy of the transmission system, particularly in evacuating electricity from cost-effective and indigenous generation resources located in the southern part of the country.
It noted that the system was often forced to rely on more expensive power plants in the northern region, which significantly increased the overall cost of electricity supply.
Despite the critical importance of resolving these issues, many transmission bottlenecks have remained unaddressed for years. The NGC has consistently failed to resolve them in a timely and efficient manner.
Observations show that nearly every second project undertaken by the NGC suffers from time delays and cost overruns. These delays not only inflate capital costs but also result in operational inefficiencies, such as the forced dispatch of power plants in violation of the EMO, leading to substantial financial losses for the power system.
The south-to-north transmission corridor remains a major bottleneck in NGC’s network, limiting the transfer of cost-effective electricity primarily from coal, nuclear and gas plants in the south to key demand centres in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
As a result, the system continues to rely on more expensive residual fuel oil (RFO) and re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) generation in the north, pushing up generation costs and tariffs.
The regulator cited the example of the overloaded 500kV Jamshoro and Matiari grid stations and their associated lines, which it said restrict power flow to about 1,800MW against available system capacity of 4,500MW. This bottleneck causes frequent load curtailment of up to 1,750MW of cheaper power. Evacuation of more than 2,000MW from Karachi’s two nuclear power plants was another example.
As a related event, the 4,000MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) Matiari-Lahoretransmission line, commissioned in September 2021 over 878km, still remains underutilised due to delays in completing the 500kV Lahore North substation and related transmission lines.
“This inefficiency imposes a financial burden on end-users despite the line’s full operational readiness,” the regulator said, adding that average loading of the line in FY2024-25 was recorded as 1,401.40MW with utilisation factor at just 35.04pc. There are many other such examples of smaller scale, Nepra noted.
The regulator also highlighted weaknesses in grid monitoring infrastructure. It said the original Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, the telecom backbone operational since 1992, had become obsolete due to the lack of hardware and software upgrades, impairing functionality.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967619,Late rally lifts equities in volatile week - Dawn,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) endured a highly volatile week but managed to close on a positive note, buoyed by a sharp rally in the final session as easing geopolitical tensions and robust large-scale manufacturing (LSM) data revived investor confidence.
After remaining under pressure due to regional uncertainties and mixed macroeconomic signals, bulls returned with force on Friday. The benchmark KSE-100 index surged by more than 3,642 points in a single session, reclaiming the 185,000 level and snapping a two-session decline.
Despite the dramatic finish, weekly gains remained modest. According to Topline Securities Ltd, the KSE-100 index posted a week-on-week increase of just 0.37 per cent, sharply lower than the 3pc gain recorded in the previous week. The brokerage attributed the slowdown in momentum to reduced inflows from local mutual funds amid heightened geopolitical tensions linked to the US-Iran situation.
Market activity also weakened. Average daily traded volume fell 24pc week-on-week to 982 million shares, while average daily value declined 26pc to Rs58.5 billion, reflecting cautious investor participation.
Friday surge offset geopolitical jitters and subdued trading activity
Key economic developments during the week provided some support. Data released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association showed car sales of 13,280 units in December 2025, marking a 35pc increase year-on-year, though down 14pc month-on-month. Meanwhile, the LSM index posted a strong 10.37pc year-on-year growth in November 2025 and a marginal 0.16pc month-on-month increase, reinforcing expectations of a gradual economic recovery.
The bond market also signalled optimism. In the latest Pakistan Investment Bonds auction, the government raised Rs488bn against a target of Rs450bn, with cut-off yields declining by 59 to 70 basis points across various tenors. The fall in yields reflected growing expectations of a policy rate cut at the upcoming monetary policy meeting on Jan 26.
According to Arif Habib Ltd (AHL), the KSE-100 index remained largely range-bound for most of the week before closing at 185,099 points, up 689 points or 0.4pc week-on-week. The brokerage noted that market sentiment stayed subdued amid escalating geopolitical uncertainty, but improved sharply on Friday due to fresh liquidity, easing tensions and strengthened expectations of monetary easing.
On the macro front, oil production rose 1.1pc week-on-week to 65,444 barrels per day, led by higher output from northern fields amid reduced curtailment. Gas production increased to 3,012 million cubic feet per day, the highest level since mid-March 2025, driven by increased supply to the fertiliser and power sectors. Prices of motor spirit and high-speed diesel remained unchanged at Rs253.17 and Rs257.08 per litre, respectively.
Foreign exchange indicators showed marginal improvement. State Bank of Pakistan-held reserves increased by $16.1 million to $16.1bn, while the rupee appreciated slightly by 0.03pc week-on-week to close at Rs279.95 against the US dollar.
AHL expects the market to remain positive in the coming week, supported by the approaching monetary policy decision and anticipation of a rate cut. The brokerage added that the ongoing corporate result season could provide further upside, particularly in case of positive earnings surprises. The KSE-100 index is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.2 times, offering an attractive dividend yield of around 5.4pc.
AKD Securities Ltd also highlighted sustained volatility during the week but noted that bullish momentum ultimately prevailed as geopolitical risks began to subside and positive macroeconomic developments emerged. The brokerage pointed to defence export discussions with regional partners and strong LSM growth as supportive factors.
Sector-wise, transport, paper and board, oil and gas exploration, property, and automobile parts were among the top performers, while textile-related sectors lagged. In terms of investor flows, individuals and mutual funds were net buyers, whereas banks and insurance companies remained net sellers.
Overall, analysts believe that while near-term volatility may persist, improving macro indicators and expectations of monetary easing could keep the PSX on a constructive path in the weeks ahead.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967961/italian-designer-valentino-dies-at-93,Italian designer Valentino dies at 93 - Dawn,"
ROME: A mix of carmine and scarlet, with a hint of orange — a new hue, inspired by an elderly woman at Barcelona’s opera house, whose elegance struck a young Valentino Garavani.
The colour, introduced to the fashion world several years later, in 1959, with a strapless cocktail dress of draped tulle, has carried his name — “Valentino red” — ever since, doubling as the eponymous Italian fashion group’s signature.
“I think a woman dressed in red is always wonderful, she is the perfect image of a heroine,” Valentino wrote in the book Rosso (Red), released in 2022. He would include at least one red dress in every one of his collections. Valentino, one of Italy’s leading fashion designers, died on Monday at his Roman residence, his foundation announced. He was 93 years old. The cause of death was not immediately known.
Valentino ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld as the last of a leading generation of designers, from an era before fashion became a highly commercial industry run as much by financiers and marketing executives as by couturiers.
Scaling the heights of high fashion, he was the first Italian to feature on the exclusive Paris haute couture catwalks.
Passionate about film, he dreamed as a young man of dressing the  “beautiful ladies of the silverscreen”, as he called them, among them 1950s Hollywood stars Lana Turner and Judy Garland. Valentino would eventually design Elizabeth Taylor’s wedding gown, and was the first choice for numerous Oscar winners, including Sharon Stone and Penelope Cruz.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967818,Shortcuts to growth - Dawn,"RECENT chatter suggests there is significant pressure on the government to movebeyondmacroeconomic stabilisation. With economic activity languishing, rumours of ministerial changes have popped up as well, as if somehow specific personnel are the only thing standing in the way of six per cent growth. Despite IMF tutelage, these pressures will not be easy to stave off. Something will eventually give.
What are the usual pathways to growth? In Pakistan’s case, reducing interest rates and easing up of import restrictions coupled with some sort of a tax let-off usually generates economic momentum based on consumption. This has been the script for several decades. Beyond the brief rush that it provides, its other outcomes too are fairly straightforward.
There is increasedpressureon scant reserves, a widening fiscal deficit and downward pressure on the currency. In some sequence and combination, this usually leads to devaluation and inflation, followed by areturnto the IMF’s doorstep in the face of looming default. Macroeconomic stabilisation ensues through a throttling of economic activity via increased interest rates, import restrictions, and higher taxes. In other words, a move back to square one.
For the generation gaining adulthood in the 2000s, this particular sequence has already played itself out four times, neatly coinciding with a transfer of power between different actors. The fundamentals are still the same suggesting that the planned pursuit of growth would be a fifth repetition of the boom-bust cycle in just under two decades.
There is no straightforward path to growth that doesn’t see us back to square one in a year or so.
What is this ‘fundamental’ that has stayed the same? If we reduce growth to a simple arithmetic problem of finding enough dollars to spend, then nothing has truly changed on that front. In fact, dollars are even harder to find today than they were a few years back. The standard source of foreign exchange, ie, exports, are stagnant. Domestic capitalists find it difficult to both make things that the rest of the world wants and getting the rest of the world to buy the thing they make.
Global cheap credit liquidity has dried up, there are no substantial geostrategic rents to be obtained, no Sino or Saudi benevolent patrons who can shower billions, and no queue of dollar-armed investors waiting to set up shop in the country. The only saving grace here are the common people, who ship themselves abroad to labour in harsh conditions for the sake of their families. Their earned billions are ventilating an economy otherwise plagued by asphyxiation.
This cursory, yet fairly standard, picture of the economy shows that in the current scenario, with all things being the way they are, there is no straightforward path to growth that doesn’t see us back to square one in a year or so.
Mainstream, technocratic answers to breaking this bind are both familiar and banal. ‘Reform’ is the word most frequently thrown around. The power sector needs to be reformed so that the cost of making stuff (to sell to the world) can go down. The economy needs better documentation so that the burden of taxation on the formal sector (that makes things and employs people) eases up. The size of the government in terms of personnel and their regulatory footprint needs to be reduced so that there is more money available to be spent on enhancing human capabilities (and productivity).
Maybe some of these standard technocratic prescriptions will take place in my lifetime (I am approaching 40). They may even lead to some of the results they’re supposedly meant to produce, but there’s little guarantee either way. There are other prescriptions too, more radical ones that involve mass mobilisation and the redistribution of means and resources to people in order to boost domestic production and consumption. However, the likelihood of such a path being traversed is even lower.
Either way, past experience suggests that implementing even the most benign reforms is costly: the intra-elite political conflicts they produce are untenable, and most Pakistani decision-makers, civilian and military, are reluctant to go through with it. Why? Because politicians, even those with dubious mandates, have constituencies and status quo beneficiaries as benefactors; and the establishment, apart from being a status quo beneficiary itself, wants a resuscitation of legitimacy in the shortest time possible, which can’t be squared with the long gestation period of technocratic reform.
So, instead, we’ll likely see some jugaar that opens up space for economic activity and staves off difficult questions in the short run, passing them on to the next set of faces in charge. Two such shortcuts come to mind.
The first was alluded to by Khurram Husain in hispiecelast week — an external liquidity injection of the geostrategic/ geopolitical variant. Whether that comes through defence pacts and a backdoor to a new normal in the Middle East (or in the immediate region) is moot. If it were to transpire, it might give the Pakistani government some breathing room without changing too much domestically.
There is a second shortcut too; a domestic variant, being eyed and talked about for some time now. This one involves forcibly changing the nature of fiscal relations between the centre and the provinces through an amended NFC. By starving the provinces and holding onto more resources, the centre will be able to reduce its uptake of more debt, bring down interest rates, increase development spending and maybe even offer tax rate reductions for a short period of time.
The boost in growth will be welcomed, even if its wholly temporary. But in the process, a long-standing ‘irritant’ — the devolution of significant resources away from the centre — will also be solved. And it doesn’t take much to predict in whose pockets these freshly retrieved resources at the centre will end up.
