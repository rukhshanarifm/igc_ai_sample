https://www.dawn.com/news/1968357/t-bill-yields-cut-to-single-digits-after-four-years,T-bill yields cut to single digits after four years - Dawn,"KARACHI: The government on Wednesday reduced the cut-off yields on treasury bills by up to 31 basis points, bringing the yields for most tenors below 10 per cent for the first time in over four years.
The yields on three-month and six-month T-bills have now returned to single-digit levels, a milestone last seen in November 2021. The 12-month tenor cleared marginally higher at 10pc.
The returns on T-bills generally align closely with the State Bank of Pakistan’s policyrate.Several surveys and analysts suggest that the central bank could reduce the benchmark interest rate by 50 to 100 basis points in the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting.
The reductions in the T-bill rates were as follows: 31bps for the one-month paper, bringing the yield to 9.8pc; 26bps for the three-month tenor, down to 9.89pc; 22bps for the six-month bills, bringing them to 9.94pc; and 16bps for the 12-month papers at 10pc.
Hopes for further softening of monetary policy amplified
In the previous auction, held on Jan 7, the government had also reduced cut-off yields by 29bps for the one-month T-bills, 34bps for the three-month papers, 32bps for the six-month bills, and 33bps for the 12-month tenor.
A report from Arif Habib Ltd noted that the return of single-digit cut-off yields marked the first such occurrence in four years, with the last instance being in November 2021.
The government raised a total of Rs725.7bn in Wednesday’s auction, against a total of Rs1.85 trillion in bids. However, more funds were raised through non-competitive bids than through competitive bids. The government secured Rs293.2bn through competitive bids, with Rs432.5bn raised via non-competitive bids. Of the Rs293.2bn raised through competitive bids, Rs236bn was allocated to the 12-month T-bills.
The double reduction in T-bill yields, along with a 70bps cut in the return on Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), is seen as a clear signal in the financial sector that the central bank may soon cut interest rates.
The SBP will announce its monetary policy on Jan 26. Given the significant drop in inflation, the financial sector is anticipating a potential rate cut of up to 100bps.
“The downward movement reflects cooling inflation expectations, improving macroeconomic stability, and a decidedly dovish monetary policy outlook amid expectations of continued easing by the State Bank,” said the AHL report.
In the last auction, the government raised Rs979.3bn through T-bills and Rs108bn through PIBs, totalling Rs1.087tr.
Compared to last year, government borrowing has accelerated despite a stronger growth in revenue collection during the first half of the current fiscal year. The revenue collected during this period was 10 per cent higher than in the same period of the previous fiscal year. However, the Federal Board of Revenue faced a Rs331bn shortfall against the projected target during July-December 2025-26.

KARACHI: Having scaled a new peak above the 188,000-point barrier overnight, the bears snapped the record-setting spell at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as investors indulged in profit-taking, forcing the benchmark KSE-100 index to close in the red amid extreme volatility in the absence of any positive triggers.
According to Topline Securities Ltd, the local bourse witnessed a bout of profit booking as investors sought to maximise recent gains, leading to a volatile trading session. The benchmark index swung sharply, posting an intraday high of 901 points, a low of 1,994 points, and eventually settling at 187,033.27, down 1,588.51 points or 0.84 per cent, as cautious sentiment dominated.
Heavyweights such as Pakistan Petroleum, Sazgar Engineering Works, and National Bank of Pakistan provided some respite, collectively contributing 135 points to the index. However, selling pressure in Meezan Bank, Engro Holdings, MCB Bank, Habib Bank, and Systems Ltd outweighed these gains, cumulatively shaving 792 points off the benchmark.
Despite a bearish trend, market participation remained robust, with total volume rising 8.14pc to 1.32 billion shares, and the traded value increasing 8.89pc to Rs69.5bn. K-Electric topped the volume chart with 263 million shares.
Arif Habib Ltd (AHL) noted that, despite opening on a strong footing, the PSX came under selling pressure, with profit-takers capitalising on elevated levels, dragging the index into negative territory by the close.
On the corporate side, Lotte Chemical Pakistan Ltd announced an interim cash dividend of Rs5 per share for the year ending Dec 31, 2025.
On the macro front, Fitch Ratings affirmed Pakistan’s long-term sovereign rating at ‘B-’ and assigned a Recovery Rating of ‘RR4’, following the removal of the ratings from ‘Under Criteria Observation’. The action reflects the application of Fitch’s new Sovereign Rating Criteria, effective Sept­ember 2025.
Analysts expect the market to consolidate within the 185,000-190,000 range before resuming any further upside, with 185,000 acting as the first key support level.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967616,40 samples test positive for poliovirus in December - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: As many as 40 environmental samples from all four provinces and the federal capital were found positive during the month of December.
According to an official of the polio laboratory located at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, as many as 127 sewage samples from 87 districts were tested for the presence of poliovirus in December 2025. Of these, 87 samples tested negative, while 40 samples were found positive for poliovirus.
“As many as 23 samples were collected from Balochistan, of which 21 were found negative and two were found positive. A total of 34 samples were collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, of which 26 were negative and eight were found positive. From Punjab, 31 samples were collected, of which 25 were negative and six were positive. In Sindh, six samples were found negative and 23 were positive. In Islamabad, one out of five samples was found positive. However, five samples collected from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan were found negative,” the official said.
Replying to a question, the official explained that if the virus causing the crippling disease was found in sewage, the sample was termed positive, while the paralysis of a child caused by the virus was recorded as a positive case. “A sewage water sample from an area is a basic parameter used to determine whether polio vaccination campaigns are being carried out successfully. After detection of positive samples, polio campaigns are immediately launched to eradicate the virus from the area,” he said.
“A polio case can be reported in any city due to the frequent movement of people from one city to another, but the presence of the virus in sewage water means that a vaccination campaign in the area did not meet its target. The presence of the virus in sewage water also indicates that the immunity level of local children has fallen and that they are at risk of the disease,” the official explained.
According to a statement, in 2025 the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, led by the government of Pakistan, conducted six vaccination campaigns, including five nationwide and one subnational drive, reaching over 45 million children.
As part of this roadmap, the first nationwide polio campaign of 2026 will be conducted from February 2 to 8 in all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children under the age of five.
“To further strengthen immunity, the government of Pakistan continues to provide free routine immunisation services for all children up to two years of age. Together, routine immunisation and repeated polio vaccination provide the strongest and most reliable protection against polio and other preventable diseases.
Parents and caregivers are strongly urged to en­­sure that children under five re­­ceive polio drops during every vaccination campaign to protect them from lifelong disability,” it stated.

Speaking at the Pakis­tan Leadership Conversa­tion on Thursday, the minister emphasised collective acceleration, export-led growth, and investor-friendly reforms as key drivers for economic transformation.
Drawing lessons from China’s development journey, Mr Sheikh highlighted how China’s focus on value-added products and export-led growth transformed it into one of the world’s leading exporters.
He stressed that Pakistan can replicate this success by upgrading its production base, improving quality standards, and moving up the global value chain.
He underlined that future-fit and skilled human capital is critical for sustainable development, adding that productivity enhancement — not just headline GDP growth — must remain Pakistan’s economic north star. He emphasised technology adoption, managerial capacity, and SME formalisation to strengthen competitiveness.
Highlighting digital transformation, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh said that digital technologies, artificial intelligence, and fintech can enable Pakistan to leapfrog economically, provided adoption moves from pilot projects to large-scale platforms.
Referring to improving market sentiment, the investment minister noted that rising investor confidence reflected in the stock market performance indicates growing trust in Pakistan’s economic direction.
Reaffirming the prime minister’s vision, he stated that the government is implementing investor-friendly reforms to improve ease of doing business and ensure regulatory predictability.
The minister informed investors that special economic zones offer a ten-year income tax exemption, while around 6,000 acres of land are available near Port Qasim for investment purposes. He further highlighted that the Business Facilitation Centre is providing one-window solutions to domestic and foreign investors.
He concluded by reiterating that the Board of Investment remains committed to providing all possible facilitation to foreign investors and positioning Pakistan as a competitive, reliable, and future-ready investment destination.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968540,Used phone rates to fall as govt revisits valuation - Dawn,"• Ruling covers 62 models across Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, OnePlus• iPhones see steepest cuts  • Values apply regardless of condition; accessories not included• Phones must be activated six months before import
ISLAMABAD: As mobile phone prices remain elevated for new buyers due to higher assessed values, the Customs Valuation Department has reduced assessment rates for duties and taxes on the commercial import of used and old mobile phone sets to ease pressure on consumers in the used smartphone market.
At the same time, fresh assessment values have been set for high-end used iPhone models, ranging from the iPhone 14 and its variants to the iPhone 15 series. For Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus, the assessed rates have largely been left unchanged or fixed for the first time.
The revised rates were notified through Valuation Ruling No. 2035 of 2026, which will come into effect from Jan 16, 2026.
Customs officials said the revision reflects a decline in international prices of older smartphones, particularly iPhones, as these devices approach the end of their commercial life cycle.
The downward adjustment, they added, is intended to align valuations with market rates and ensure the benefit is passed on to end consumers through lower duties and, potentially, lower retail prices.
Officials said the new ruling covers 62 mobile phone models across four leading brands, either through revised values or first-time valuation. They said the methodology relied on market inquiries, benchmarked against trade-in prices published on the official websites of manufacturers, including Samsung, Google and OnePlus.
The government levies multiple charges on mobile phones, including a flat Rs250 per set, 18 per cent sales tax, withholding tax, a handset levy and regulatory duties. These are calculated on the notified assessed value of each handset.
A comparison of values notified for 2026 with those issued in 2024 shows a sharp reduction in assessed values for used phones. Used iPhones recorded the steepest cuts, with declines ranging from 32pc to 81pc.
Among the biggest revisions, the assessed value of the iPhone 12 Pro fell to $155 from $280, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max was reduced to $215 from $340.
The iPhone 13 was cut to $170 from $280, the iPhone 11 Pro Max to $145 from $245, and the iPhone XS Max to $95 from $150. The iPhone X was lowered to $57 from $75.
Even newer flagship models were revised downwards, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max reduced to $295 from $430, and the iPhone 13 Pro to $225 from $360.
The department also fixed assessment values for seven newer used iPhone models. Under the new rates, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been valued at $460, the iPhone 15 Pro at $390, the iPhone 15 Plus at $320, and the iPhone 15 at $310.
For the iPhone 14 lineup, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has been assessed at $360, the iPhone 14 Pro at $290, and the iPhone 14 at $210.
Samsung, Google, OnePlus
By contrast, valuations for other major brands were largely unchanged. Only a marginal adjustment was recorded for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which was assessed at $255, reflecting a modest decline.
Other Samsung models were valued at lower but steady levels, with the Galaxy S23 Plus assessed at $160, the Galaxy S23 at $140, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G at $160. Older models included the Galaxy S21 Plus 5G at $69, the Galaxy S21 5G at $50, the Galaxy S20 Plus at $46, and the Galaxy S20 at $41.
For Google Pixel devices, the ruling fixed values across newer and older models, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL at $260, the Pixel 9 Pro at $195, and the Pixel 9 at $150. The Pixel 8 Pro was valued at $188 and the Pixel 8 at $98.
A similar pattern was reported for OnePlus phones, with the OnePlus 12 assessed at $184 and the OnePlus 12R at $105, while older models were valued at $92 for the OnePlus 11, $65 for the OnePlus 10 Pro, and $60 for the OnePlus 10T.
According to the ruling, the notified values will apply to used mobile phones imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, and will form the basis for the assessment of duties and taxes at the time of import. The values will apply regardless of the specific grade or condition of the phones.
It further stipulates that devices must have been activated at least six months prior to export to Pakistan. Importers will be required to declare the activation period, which will be verified by assessing officers during clearance.
Customs officials said the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held consultations with stakeholders on Aug 12, Sept 26 and Dec 15 last year. Import data covering a 90-day period was collected and analysed, while market inquiries were carried out to determine revised values.
For brands and models imported commercially but not listed in the ruling, importers have been advised to determine assessable values under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1968379,SOEs: an eclectic approach - Dawn,"A CONTROVERSY is raging on both mainstream and social media over PIA’s recentprivatisation. Unless this debate is addressed rationally, future privatisation transactions may also be at risk. Past experience offers a cautionary lesson: the Supreme Court’s decision to annul the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills did not revive the enterprise; instead, it led to itsclosurein 2015 and significantly slowed the overall privatisation process.
The popular binary often advanced — either retain enterprises under government ownership or privatise them — is flawed. Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations rather than ideological preferences. Pakistan has 85 commercial SOEs for diverse purposes across power, oil and gas; transport and communications; manufacturing, mining and engineering; finance; industrial estate development and management; and wholesale and retail trade. Of these, 51 are currently profitable. The argument that profitable SOEs should never be divested is as untenable as the view that all 34 lossmaking entities must be privatised. Neither ownership per se nor current financial performance should solely determine policy.
The basic principle for deciding whether an economic activity should be undertaken by the government — through its departments or through an SOE — rests on two questions: a) does the activity fall within the government’s public policy framework? b) Can it be adequately performed by the private sector?
Relevance to public policy framework:The PPF reflects the government’s development priorities, as articulated in documents such as the Principles of Policy (Article 3 of the Constitution) and sectoral policies relating to agriculture, industry, trade, etc. In assessing alignment with the PPF, it is necessary to consider whether an SOE is connected to one or more core state functions — i) ensuring national food security; ii) developing and managing large-scale infrastructure; iii) national defence and security-related activities; iv) entities established through government-to-government or intergovernmental arrangements; and v) provision of goods and services of critical national economic interest. If an SOE falls into any of these categories, there is a prima facie case for retaining it under government control. The decision then is whether it should be retained in its existing form or restructured to improve performance.
Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations.
Market failure considerations:The second question concerns market failure: can the private sector adequately deliver the relevant activity? Each SOE must be evaluated in terms of its operations, functions and market structure, with attention to the following: a) is the SOE a natural monopoly; if so, does an effective regulatory framework exist to ensure socially optimal and cost-effective service delivery under private ownership? b) Does the SOE perform a function that generates significant positive externalities and is, therefore, insufficiently profitable for the private sector to undertake? c) Are there alternative delivery mechanisms to achieve the same objectives?
Where market failure prevents the private sector from maximising social welfare, the government has a strong case for retaining control. Even then, competition can be introduced by dismantling monopolies where feasible and establishing strong, independent regulatory agencies.
Financial viability:While several SOEs report accounting profits, financial viability requires more rigorous assessment. The key question is whether the organisation can generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, meet debt obligations, and, where relevant, finance investment for growth while maintaining acceptable service standards. The financial viability test should be based on the following: a) Negative shareholders’ equity: Any entity with negative equity for the past three years is financially stressed, as its balance sheet is not bankable and it remains dependent on government guarantees or direct budgetary support. b) Continuous losses: Entities incurring losses over the last three years are similarly stressed, as losses either necessitate government support or gradually erode equity. c) Return on assets: While return on equity is a standard metric, ROA is more appropriate when equity is negative. ROA measures how effectively management uses assets to generate earnings. SOEs with an ROA below five per cent for three consecutive years should be considered financially stressed.
In such cases, financial restructuring is the first step. If restructuring fails under government ownership due to extraneous constraints, alternative options — such as outsourcing, leasing, concession agreements, or transfer of managerial control — should be considered. SOEs that don’t meet public policy criteria, don’t address market failure concerns, or cannot be made viable even after restructuring are prime candidates for privatisation, liquidation, or winding up.
Lessons from successful privatisation:Pakistan’s main privatisation success stories are the banking and telecom sectors. In banking, the share of assets held by nationalised commercial banks declined from around 80pc to about 20pc following privatisation. Prior to 2003, the government injected Rs46 billion to recapitalise lossmaking banks; non-performing loans stood at 25pc, and financial soundness indicators were weak. Since privatisation, four major banks (HBL, UBL, MCB, and ABL) have contributed Rs245bn in corporate taxes in 2024 with cumulative contributions exceeding Rs1.6 trillion since 2004. NPLs have fallen below 7pc, provisioning exceeds 100pc, and overall financial soundness has improved.
The main weakness in recent years is the growing role of banks as public sector financiers, reflected in a declining advance-to-deposit ratio. Importantly, public sector banks such as the NBP and the Bank of Punjab have also improved under a competitive market structure and rank among the top 15 Asia-Pacific banks. The ideological argument that these institutions must also be privatised ignores the empirical evidence that ownership itself is not the decisive factor.
PIA’s case:Applying this framework (spelt out in the SOE Triage Report 2021) to PIA leads to a clear conclusion: there were no compelling public policy or market failure reasons for retaining it under government control. The aviation industry is competitive, and private operators have proved their capacity to perform effectively. Despite repeated restructuring efforts, PIA accumulated losses of Rs850bn. The privatisation objective was not short-term maximisation of sale proceeds but elimination of recurring losses and revival of the airline as an efficient enterprise. Over the longer term, improved performance under private management is expected to generate a steady stream of tax revenues rather than drain the exchequer. In sum, Pakistan needs an eclectic, evidence-based approach to SOEs, which transcends ideological divides and focuses squarely on public policy relevance, market structure, and financial viability.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1967111,"Explainer: Iran’s economy faces rocky road amid rising prices, falling currency - Dawn","Iran’s economy is going through one of its most difficult periods in years, fueled by sanctions, high inflation, and a significant drop in the value of the national currency, the rial.
These pressures have had a direct impact on living standards and have also fueled recent protests.
The protests began on Dec. 28 in commercial hubs in the capital Tehran, when shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners staged strikes and demonstrations to protest soaring inflation, the collapsing rial, and deteriorating economic conditions, and have since grown into nationwide anti-government expressions of discontent involving workers, students, and others across multiple cities.
The Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran’s economic problems amid the protests. Masoud Pezeshkian said the government admits to “shortcomings and problems” and is working hard to alleviate the people’s concerns, especially on the economy.
The Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. It started last year at around 817,000 rials per $1, then sank to 1.42-1.47 million rials on the parallel market by late 2025.
Due to the rial’s sharp decline, most Iranians have struggled to keep up with steadily rising prices.
The currency has been suffering for years in the face of sanctions and inflationary pressures, going from about 34,000 rials to the US dollar in 2016 to around 270,000 in 2021 and some 430,000 in 2022.
By 2023-2024, the rial had crossed the 750,000 mark on the open market, and its depreciation accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the rial has lost nearly 800 per cent of its value, and as of this week, it trades at around 1.5 million rials to the dollar, severely eroding household purchasing power.
As the rial weakened, import costs shot up, feeding inflation and forcing businesses to raise prices. For ordinary Iranians, the falling currency has wiped out savings, reduced purchasing power, and created fear that prices will continue rising.
Traders and shopkeepers have been among the first to protest, as they struggle to afford goods amid daily currency swings.
Inflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Middle- and lower-income families are increasingly forced to cut back on basic goods.
Consumer price inflation remains exceptionally high, with inflation estimated at 30.6pc in 2020 before rising sharply to 43.4pc in 2021 and staying elevated at around 44pc–46pc in both 2022 and 2023.
Although inflation eased to about 32.5pc in 2024, it is projected to accelerate again, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting inflation of 42.4pc in 2025 and remaining above 40pc in 2026, underscoring the persistence of price pressures driven by currency weakness and structural constraints.
Food costs and staples have grown much faster, with sectoral inflation (such as bread and fruit) substantially outpacing the national rate.
The Statistical Centre of Iran reported that food inflation last September reached 58pc, more than double the rate in the same month the previous year. According to the survey, fruit costs have soared 75pc while bread and grains, which are staples in Iranian households, have almost doubled in price.
Although the government provides cash handouts and subsidies, including monthly payments, and food staple, electricity, and foreign exchange subsidies, these measures have not offset the impact of rising prices, especially as the value of payments declines alongside the rial.
Iran’s economy is still severely hampered by international sanctions. US sanctions limit access to the international financial system, banking transactions, and oil exports. Even when Iran is successful in exporting oil, access to hard currency is often restricted, delayed, or held overseas.
According to aReuterssurvey, Iran’s oil output fell by 100,000 barrels per day in late 2025 due to the sanctions, which directly cut into government revenue.
Total exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, while imports are expected to fall by roughly 10pc to $98bn, according to the IMF, reflecting tighter foreign exchange and sanctions pressure.
In 2025, the IMF projected a 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) decline in both output and exports as of last May. A greater decline of up to half a million bpd has been projected by independent energy analytics companies, including Kpler, Vortexa, and TankerTrackers.
As a result, foreign exchange inflows have fallen, and the Central Bank’s capacity to maintain currency stability has been eroded. Additionally, sanctions have hindered trade and discouraged foreign investment, pushing Iran to rely on unofficial routes that raise prices and decrease transparency.
Iran’s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. In the fiscal year that ended last March, Iran’s Central Bank estimated oil revenues of $67bn. The bank reported oil revenues of $56bn for fiscal 2024, $55bn for 2023, $38bn for 2022, and $23bn for 2021.
However, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the export figures vary. In the calendar year 2018, when the first Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran, oil revenues reached $51bn, according to the EIA. In 2020, they sank to $5bn, before rebounding to $43bn in 2024.
Iran’s fiscal position remains under strain, with the government running persistent budget deficits amid constrained revenues and rising spending pressures.
According to IMF-based estimates, the budget deficit stood at around 4.1pc of GDP in 2024 and is expected to widen to about 6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, before remaining elevated at roughly 6.2pc of GDP in 2026. The deterioration reflects limited oil revenue recovery under sanctions, weak non-oil tax collection, and higher outlays on subsidies, wages, and social support, adding to inflationary and currency pressures.
In its most recent budget, the government estimated daily oil shipments of 1.85 million barrels per day at $67 per barrel. However, the IMF projected that actual exports would only average 1.1 million barrels per day, showing a significant deficit.
Over the last five years, Iran’s economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown.
After a period of lost growth in the late 2010s, GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022, largely driven by a recovery in oil exports and domestic services following the pandemic. This momentum peaked in 2023 with a 5.3pc expansion, but the trajectory has since cooled considerably.
By 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 from the IMF and the World Bank suggest a near-stagnant rate of just 0.3pc to 0.6pc. This recent deceleration is attributed to intensified sanctions, chronic inflation (averaging near 40pc), and severe energy shortages that have hampered industrial productivity.
While the oil sector remains a primary driver of the nominal economy — which fluctuated between $350bn and $475bn — non-oil sectors continue to struggle under structural constraints and a weakening currency.
In addition, the labour market over the last five years has been characterised by a jobless recovery followed by a tightening market amid recent economic stagnation. Official figures showed the total unemployment rate declining from 9.3pc in 2021 to a record low of approximately 7.2pc to 8.2pc by late 2024.
Youth unemployment remains a critical challenge, consistently hovering between 20pc and 23pc, nearly triple the national average.
