https://www.dawn.com/news/1963308,Government borrowing reverses course - Dawn,"KARACHI: The government’s borrowing from banks in the first half of FY26 has marked a sharp reversal from last year’s pattern, with Rs672 billion raised against net debt retirement during the same period of FY25.
Latestdatafrom the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed that, as the first half of FY26 draws to a close, the government borrowing remains limited to Rs672bn, compared with debt retirement of Rs1.7 trillion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
Bankers expect heavy borrowing in the second half of the current fiscal year as the government faces liquidity constraints due to revenue shortfalls, which they say remain below target.
Financial market sources said the government continues to rely on banks to stay within its targeted fiscal space. Bankers noted that dividend payouts to the federal government surged sharply in FY25, with around Rs2.7tr transferred to the national exchequer, providing significant fiscal relief.
Another SBPreportshows that banks’ investments stood at Rs36.7tr by end-June 2025, underscoring that the bulk of domestic borrowing continues to come from the banking sector.
Rs672bn raised during 1HFY26 in contrast with Rs1.7tr debt retirement
Banks say around 86 per cent of the fiscal deficit is financed through bank borrowing, a factor they believe contributes to weak liquidity flows to the private sector.
In FY25, about 91pc of Pakistan’s total fiscal deficit was financed from domestic sources, with banks playing the dominant role.
Reliance on domestic banks has remained a persistent trend as external financing often falls short of targets.
In FY24, nearly 88pc of deficit financing was raised through domestic markets. FY23 was considered the most challenging year, when external financing pressures pushed the government to rely heavily on bank borrowing to bridge the fiscal gap.
A World Bank report issued on Dec 19 said Pakistan’s path to inclusive and sustainable growth requires stronger mobilisation of domestic resources and more efficient and transparent use of public funds.
The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors has approved$700min financing for the Pakistan Public Resources for Inclusive Development – Multiphase Programmatic Approach (PRID-MPA), a multi-year initiative aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability and service delivery.
According to the report, the PRID-MPA will support federal and provincial reforms to mobilise domestic revenue, improve spending quality and leverage data and digital tools for better public services. The programme will provide up to $1.35bn in total financing, including $600m for federal programmes and $100m for Sindh.
“The results-based design ensures that resources are only disbursed once programme objectives are achieved,” the report said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1964128,Pakistan inks climate resilience initiatives with Asian Development Bank - Dawn,"Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Tuesday signed two major climate resilience initiatives—one focused on Sindh and the other on Punjab—according to a statement issued by the Economic Affairs Division.
The projects include the $180.5 million Sindh Coastal Resilience Sector Project (SCRP) and the $124 million Punjab Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Agriculture Mechanisation Project.
Economic Secretary Muhammad Humair Karim “expressed his sincere appreciation for ADB’s role as a trusted development partner and its continued support to Pakistan in advancing climate resilience, sustainable agriculture, and inclusive growth”, the statement read.
Karim highlighted that the SCRP will promote integrated water resource and flood risk management and restore nature-based coastal defences. It is also expected to strengthen the institutional and community capacity for strategic action planning.
“The project, financed through $140.5m from [the] ADB (including [a] $140m loan and [a] $500,000 technical assistance grant), $40m from the Green Climate Fund and $20m as counterpart funding from the Government of Sindh, will directly benefit over 3.8 million people in Thatta, Sujawal and Badin districts,” the statement read.
It added that according to the secretary, the Punjab Climate Resilient and Low Carbon Agriculture Mechanisation Project will enhance agricultural productivity and climate resilience in 30 districts of the province.
“The project amounting to $129m, financed [by a] $120m ADB loan, [a] $4m ADB grant and [a] $5m as counterpart funding from the Government of Punjab, will improve [the] access of small farmers to climate-smart machinery, introduce circular agriculture practices to reduce residue burning, establish testing and training facilities and empower 15,000 women through skills development and livelihood diversification,” the Economic Division stated.
The statement added that the secretary hailed both initiatives as “transformative in nature”, adding that the SCRP would safeguard livelihoods, food security and biodiversity along the province’s coastal belt, while the Punjab mechanisation project would drive sustainable, low-carbon agriculture and inclusive development.
ADB Country Director Emma Fan appreciated the federal government’s strong commitment to these initiatives and emphasised the significance of the SCRP in addressing climate risks and protecting coastal communities, the Economic Division said.
She further highlighted the Punjab mechanisation project as “a critical step in modernising agriculture and reducing emissions”.
Pakistan and the ADB “expressed their commitment to effectively utilise the financing for [the] successful and timely completion of the two initiatives”, the statement added.
On December 25, Pakistan and the lender signedtwo major initiativestotalling $730m — a power transmission strengthening project and an accelerating state-owned enterprise (SOE) transformation programme — which would relieve overloading of existing transmission lines and improve operational efficiency.
At the beginning of this year, Pakistan and ADBsignedan agreement to provide $200 million in support to the country’s ailing power distribution system through network improvement.
In the recent agreement, the second power transmission strengthening project amounts to $330m, while the accelerating SOE transformation programme is worth $400m, according to a statement.
Ministry of Economic Affairs Secretary Muhammad Humair Karim appreciated the Manila-based lending agency’s role and its continued support in advancing critical infrastructure and governance reforms, the statement said.","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:03:24 GMT",,The projects include the $180.5 million Sindh Coastal Resilience Sector Project (SCRP) and the $124 million Punjab Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Agriculture Mechanisation Project.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963128,Govt moves to phase out state-led power purchases - Dawn,"• CCoE approves pilot wheeling auction under Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Model• 800MW to be auctioned for five years; volumes may rise after trial phase• Indicative wheeling charge put at Rs12.55 per unit; industry objects to cost impact• 18-member steering committee formed for integrated energy planning
ISLAMABAD: The government has approved a pilot electricity auction that will allow power to be bought and sold through competition, while also end­o­r­sing steps towards integrated energy planning a­cross the country to end fragmented decision-making.
In this regard, the Cabinet Committee on Energy on Wednesday approved framework guidelines for a “wheeling” auction of 800-megawatt of electricity under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Model (CTBCM).
Wheeling refers to the use of the national electricity grid to deliver power from a generator to a buyer. Big factories or companies may buy electricity directly from a producer, but they still need the grid wires to get it. The fee they pay for using those wires is called wheeling and grid charges.
The meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also decided to end future procurement of power generation capacity in the public sector and constituted an 18-member steering committee of federal and provincial bureaucrats to lead integrated energy planning (IEP) — a push to bring electricity, oil, gas and other energy planning under a single coordinated national approach.
Under the framework guidelines, 800MW of generation capacity would be sold through a competitive auction for five years. The quantum would gradually increase after the initial trial, subject to government approval.
The auction is being developed under CTBCM, a system in which power producers and buyers deal directly with each other, rather than the government acting as the main middleman. In plain words, electricity is bought and sold like a market, not fully controlled by the government.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) would determine the wheeling and grid charges for bulk power consumers upon a uniform petition to be filed by the distribution companies under the guidance of the power division.
An indicative wheeling charge of about Rs12.55 per unit may come into force, although industrial consumers are contesting it as too high and rendering their products uncompetitive.
The guidelines require the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO) — a new entity created under the Power Division — to issue the auction process with Nepra’s approval.
ISMO will issue an auction calendar and detailed procedures. The framework does not allow a minimum or maximum limit on bid prices (no “cap” or “floor”), and the bid price is to remain fixed for one year.
The guidelines also delineate the roles and responsibilities for the implementing agencies, including Nepra, ISMO and auction participants, and govern the entire structure of the CTBCM.
Under the timelines agreed with the IMF, approval of these guidelines for auction was targeted for December and approval of uniform wheeling charges by Nepra in January 2026.
An official statement said the resident committee of the top civil-military forum — the Special Investment Facilitation Council — had decided to have an integrated energy plan through federal and provincial coordination under the umbrella of the Power Division of the Ministry of Energy.
“A consequential determination has been reached regarding electricity wheeling within the country, thereby laying the foundation for the inception and advancement of a competitive energy market,” an official statement said, adding that approvals had been extended to the competitive bidding process, participant engagement and other pertinent aspects.
This encompasses auth­or­isation for the CTBCM framework pertaining to electricity auctions, it said, adding that “consistent with the government’s pledges, no further electricity procurement agreements shall be entered into”, formally disengaging the government from electricity procurement activities.
The clearance for IEP governance by the Cabinet Committee on Energy on Wednesday would be followed by the notification of an IEP steering committee before the close of the current month.
Next, the cabinet committee will approve IEP’s high-level design by February 2026, to be followed by its model workshops across the country by October 2026, leading to formal approval of the National Integrated Energy Plan (NIEP) by the committee by April 2027.
The IEP steering committee, led by the power minister and co-chaired by the petroleum minister, would comprise about nine federal secretaries, four provincial chief secretaries and the chairpersons of Nepra, Ogra and Wapda.
The committee would ensure wide participation of relevant stakeholders for IEP and facilitate its implementation through the resolution of inter-sectoral, federal and provincial departmental issues and align it with national development priorities, including net-zero transitions.
The Cabinet Committee on Energy also directed the development and institutionalisation of the Energy Information System by the Power Division through its Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) to provide data-based decision-making support to the government, including the “IEP Ecosystem”.
The EIS will cover capacity building, governance improvements, monitoring, policy formulation, integration of plans and policies, modelling and scenario-based planning. It added that planning activities would be executed in a unified manner through a single entity, PPMC.
The NIEP is expected to adopt a cross-sector approach, covering oil, gas, coal, water and hydropower, minerals, natural resources and renewables on the supply side, and residential, commercial, industrial, transport and agriculture needs on the demand side.
The plan is also expected to gradually incorporate an artificial intellgence-based decision-support system to create a “single source of truth” and avoid conflicting figures across institutions.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1961769,Pakistan seeks massive ADB loan to tackle remaining Rs1.7tr circular debt - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday sought substantive additional debt from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to payoff remaining Rs1.7 trillion circular debt and refinance part of recently acquired Rs1.25tr commercial financing in one-go at longer terms for bringing down expensive power tariffs and improving grid stability through demand growth.
The request was formally made by Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari to a visiting ADB delegation led by Ms Leah Gutierrez, Director General, Central and West Asia Department though he did not pitch size of the proposed loan to be discussed subsequently. ADB’s total debt stock currently stands at $17bn, the third largest after China and the World Bank.
Informed sources toldDawnthat the minister proposed that the Manila-based lending agency should come up with financing instruments and arrangements that could directly make power sector debt more affordable through longer payback period and cheaper interest rates than commercial financing from the market. The ADB’s financing and other instruments could also be leveraged to prolong debt-repayment periods.
This would enable the government to avoid budgetary injections and instead finance debt repayments through power tariff at lower than existing rates and help revive power consumption that had been struggling to pickup for years due to unaffordable electricity rates and resultant expansion of the solar revolution, leading to stability challenges to the national grid and power utilities.
Govt requests lender to help stabilise national grid, improve debt affordability, foster private investment
The government had recentlycontractedaround Rs1.25tr from local commercial banks at Kibor minus 0.9pc to replace previous debts but the central bank’s policy rate has since dropped with a similar pathway projects going ahead. The new debt is being financed through a permanent Rs3.23 per unit debt servicing surcharge on consumers. The government team also sought additional financing for smart metering expansion across distribution companies.
The minister also made a case for increased external support for Pakistan’s contribution towards lowering carbon footprint through solar revolution in the country that had also created challenges to the grid stability. The government team argued that combination of financial support for cheaper debt swaps, smart metering and global environmental contribution could significantly reduce average power rates and help stabilise system through new technologies and demand growth for grid supply.
An official statement confirmed that Mr Leghari “sought ADB’s support in addressing power sector debt repayment challenges, and in building confidence among private investors” and briefed the delegation on key challenges facing the power sector.
“He highlighted constraints in financing, issues related to rupee cover, and high upfront costs,” the statement said, adding that the government was engaging local investors through the Pakistan Business Council to attract private investment in the power transmission sector and to improve market visibility.
The minister also explained to the ADB that under the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), excess power capacity which was not required in the future had been removed and the government will not procure additional power as it was now moving towards a competitive electricity market.
He said Pakistan had already transitioned around 20GW to clean energy. “However, despite this significant transition, no dedicated financing was provided for the clean energy shift, nor was funding made available to ensure grid stability,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the transition to renewable energy continued despite these limitations.
He emphasised that serious and coordinated efforts, supported by adequate financing, were now required to keep the grid stable. The ADB team was also apprised about the details of the recently introduced Energy Surplus Package to increase electricity demand and encourage higher power offtake by the private sector.
“He requested ADB’s support on the financing side, particularly in addressing debt repayment challenges, and in building confidence among private investors,” the statement said.
The minister promised that a feasibility report aimed at private investors will be presented soon.
He also shared that the government was planning the rollout of smart meters through the private sector participation under public-private partnership model, with a focus on technology integration and improved efficiency.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963695,PPP says ready to share ‘struggling’ Centre’s burden - Dawn,"• Bilawal argues provinces can take up extra duties, will perform better than federal govt• Backs political reconciliation; asks rulers, opposition to return to democratic fold• Zardari calls for unity in country, lauds armed forces for ‘befitting response’ to India
LARKANA: As he made a case for greater provincial autonomy as a solution to shore up the economy, PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, whose party rules Sindh and Balochistan, proposed the provinces could take up additional responsibilities, such as taxation, to help the federal government overcome crises.
The PPP leader was addressing a gathering to mark the 18th death  anniversary of his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in  Garhi Khuda Bakhsh, on Saturday. Benazir was assassinated in a  gun-and-bomb attack near Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007,  after a public gathering.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari thanked PPP workers and supporters for their solidarity, saying that this kind of backing gives his party the strength to take the people’s issues to Islamabad and strive for their resolution.
Discussing the passage of the 27th Amendment, he said PPP workers had raised objections to certain controversial proposals. He claimed the party had successfully safeguarded provincial rights, the constitutional protection of the NFC Award and the creation of a constitutional court with equal representation from all provinces.
He said that the PPP remained a federal party committed to resolving the fiscal challenges faced by the Centre, while also striving to protect provincial autonomy under the 18th Amendment. He said the PPP conducted politics at both the national and provincial levels with sincerity, treating the Centre’s problems as its own.
“If there is an issue of fiscal space for the federal government, then as a patriot, I would want to help solve it. The PPP has its own politics and history, and as the chain binding the four provinces, we have a greater responsibility to address the Centre’s issues while protecting provincial rights,” he remarked.
“We think that instead of attempts to take authority away from the provinces, it would be better if the federal government gave more responsibilities to them. We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government’s issues.”
Pointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue.
“We will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crisis.”
He maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces.
“We will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan’s economic problems together so we can improve the people’s financial situation.”
‘Internal challenges’
Referring to the security situation, the PPP chairman said that in May this year Pakistan’s armed forces defeated India on the battlefield, calling it a victory for the entire nation that had enhanced Pakistan’s global standing. He, however, acknowledged that Pakistan continued to face serious internal challenges, including economic hardship, terrorism, security concerns and political instability, but reiterated the PPP’s resolve to steer the country out of these crises.
He stressed that Pakistan could not overcome the economic crisis without first resolving the political crisis. Recalling Shaheed Benazir Bhutto’s final message of reconciliation, he said political extremism must be abandoned and all political actors must return to the democratic fold.
“Political forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.”
Addressing public grievances, particularly in Hyderabad and Sukkur, he pledged that PPP would work with the federal government to resolve civic issues. On the economic front, he acknowledged that despite claims of recovery, the public had yet to feel the impact of growth, as inflation, unemployment and poverty continued to affect daily life. He said rising electricity and gas bills, education costs, medical expenses and household expenditures had eroded people’s purchasing power.
Referring to the plight of farmers after floods, he said the PPP had urged the prime minister to announce an agricultural emergency and thanked the Sindh chief minister for providing relief to farmers owning up to 25 acres through tax and input subsidies.
On education, he said the PPP aspired to provide youth from remote areas with the opportunity to study at top global institutions, adding that the Balochistan government had launched a scholarship programme to support deserving students.
Zardari lauds forces
In his address, President Asif Ali Zardari said today (Dec 27) marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir’s assassination. He also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a “befitting response” to the enemy, making it realise that Pakistan was serious.
“Modi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.” He warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, “they should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation”.
In an earlier message, the president said, “As we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.”
He stressed that Benazir “never believed in vindictiveness and vendetta”.
“She always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,” he said. “On her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,” he added. “Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,” President Zardari said about his late wife.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963333,Lay of the land - Dawn,"AS we close 2025, it is time to take a hard and honest look at the lay of the land of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Nearly 78 years after independence, Pakistan’s politics remains deeply unsettled. Of these years, approximately 33 were spent under four periods of direct military rule, with the remainder under various shades of indirect or hybrid regimes. It took 23 years for the country to hold its first general elections. To date, Pakistan has had 29 prime ministers — including caretakers and repeat tenures — yet not a single one has completed a full five-year constitutional term.
Decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and reversible.
Pakistan’s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, wasassassinatedin 1951. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto wasexecutedin 1979. Benazir Bhutto wasassassinatedin 2007. Former PM Imran Khan has been incarcerated for nearly two years and sentenced to a cumulative 51 years.
Externally, Pakistan has fought four major wars with India — in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999 — and continues to experience border tensions, including earlier this year in May. The dismemberment of the country in 1971 remains a major national trauma. In 1998, Pakistan became one of the world’s nine nuclear-armed states.
Demographic pressures have compounded these challenges.
In 1947, West Pakistan’s population was approximately 32.7 million; today Pakistan’s population is close to 250m. East Pakistan, with a population of around 40m in 1947, as Bangladesh is now roughly 177m people. Pakistan’s population growth has outpaced its ability to govern, grow, educate, employ, and provide basic services.
The key determinants of national development — political stability, governance, respect for the Constitution and rule of law, inclusive institutions, economic growth, security, corruption control, and quality of life — are all in visible decline.
Politically, Pakistan lurches from one crisis to another. The current conflict is among the most serious in recent history. Since the tragic events of May 9, 2023, political polarisation has only intensified. At the heart of this crisis lies the unresolved question of civil-military relations.
Security challenges further darken the picture. Cross-border terrorism is on the rise, insurgency continues in Balochistan, and relations with neighbouring countries have deteriorated, including now Afghanistan.
Governance failures are equally stark.
Following the 18th Constitutional Amendment, provinces were granted authority and resources to manage policing, infrastructure, water and sanitation, health, education, and local governments. Yet provincial governments have largely failed to deliver.
Local government elections are routinely delayed or avoided to prevent the devolution of power and resources. Instead, development funds are distributed through MNAs and MPAs, fostering patronage, inefficiency, and corruption.
Despite long tenures — PPP in Sindh since 2008, PTI in KP since 2013, and repeated PML-N governments in Punjab over decades — the quality of governance and service delivery remains dismal. In southern Punjab and other marginalised regions, conditions are particularly dire.
The Constitution itself has been weakened. Politically motivated amendments, notably the 26th and 27th, have eroded judicial independence. Fundamental rights guaranteed under Part II, Chapter One of the Constitution are routinely violated, as are the Principles of Policy outlined in Chapter Two. Laws such as PECA, 2016, are increasingly used to suppress dissent.
The erosion of the rule of law is reflected in global rankings. The World Justice Project defines the rule of law as the foundation of justice, opportunity, and peace. In its 2024 index covering 143 countries, Pakistan scored 0.37,ranking 130thoverall. Among South Asian countries, only Afghanistan ranks lower. Most alarming is Pakistan’s last-place ranking — 143 out of 143 — in the “order and security” category.
Economically, the situation is grim. Pakistan’s average growth rate over the past three years stands at just 1.7 per cent — the lowest for any three consecutive years in the country’s history. Approximately 45pc of the population lives below or near the poverty line, while unofficial unemployment assessment is at 22pc. This means nearly every second Pakistani is poor or near-poor, every fourth citizen is unemployed, and youth unemployment is even higher. Inflation over the past three to four years has reduced purchasing power by an estimated 65pc.
Taxation levels are among the highest in the world, with salaried classes bearing a disproportionate brunt. Corporations face effective tax rates of around 60pc, while electricity tariffs are higher than in most comparable countries. The cost of doing business has become prohibitively high, driving companies out of Pakistan and depressing investment to historic lows, despite official claims that the economy has ‘stabilised.’
Pakistan’s Human Development Index ranking has steadily worsened over the past decade. In 2024, Pakistan ranked 168 out of 193 countries, with all South Asian states except Afghanistan performing better. Health and education systems are in crisis: 40pc of children are stunted, and an estimated 40pc of school-age children are out of school. Pakistan ranks among the worst globally for neonatal mortality, hepatitis C prevalence, and type-II diabetes, and remains one of only two countries where polio has not been eradicated.
Women — half the population — continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and lack of voice. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2025,Pakistan ranked last: 148 out of 148 countries.
This is the sobering reality as 2025 draws to a close. But decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and therefore reversible.
History offers perspective. In 1965, Pakistan’s GDP per capita was comparable to that of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea. Today, all are far ahead. In the 1990s, Pakistan was South Asia’s richest country and ranked above both India and Bangladesh on the Human Development Index. Many of these countries faced deep political and economic crises, yet emerged through sustained reforms, institutional strengthening, and political consensus.
Credible economists now agree that Pakistan’s current economic model is unsustainable. Yet recovery remains possible — if the country undertakes fundamental shifts in governance, economic policy, and institutional integrity.
Ultimately, everything hinges on politics. Without resolving the present political conflict and its underlying causes, no economic or social reform can sustainably succeed. Pakistan urgently needs a broad national consensus on a new direction. As the new year approaches, such consensus appears distressingly distant.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1964066/govt-prioritises-critical-power-projects,Govt prioritises critical power projects - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Monday directed relevant ministries to finalise a prioritised list of the most critical power projects for the next three years.
Of this amount, Rs1.1tr had been spent up to June 30, while the throw-forward stood at Rs492.4 billion. The allocation for 2025-26 is Rs104.7bn, with an additional demand of around Rs175bn indicated during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.
While reviewing Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) projects in the power and hydel energy sectors, the minister also asked ministries to work out the minimum annual PSDP allocations required to complete these schemes within stipulated timelines.
Chairing a meeting, Mr Iqbal was briefed on the overall portfolio and financial position of major power and hydel projects. A total of 37 critical power sector schemes, with a combined approved cost of Rs1.7 trillion, were reviewed.
The minister said periodic portfolio reviews were essential to ensure scarce public resources were aligned with national priorities, cost overruns and implementation delays were identified early, and projects with the highest economic and social returns were completed without slippages.
Ministries told to finalise three-year framework, funding requirements
He asked the secretaries of the planning, finance, economic affairs, power and water resources ministries to jointly identify financial, technical and administrative bottlenecks and resolve them on a fast-track basis through coordinated action and stakeholder engagement.
A disciplined three-year rolling plan, Mr Iqbal said, would help avoid the accumulation of incomplete projects, contain fiscal pressures and translate public investment into tangible gains in energy security and economic growth.
The minister instructed the Power Division to prioritise near-completion projects, rationalise future financing and put in place a realistic three-year execution framework, along with PSDP funding requirements, to ensure timely delivery of strategically important schemes.
He also directed the division to submit a project-wise break-up of critical schemes, along with annual financing and execution plans for the next three years. Near-completion projects, he said, must be prioritised so that sunk investments could be converted into operational assets at the earliest.
“The objective is to reduce the throw-forward and complete priority projects within defined timelines,” Mr Iqbal said, noting that delays escalated costs and deferred economic benefits such as improved energy availability, industrial productivity and investor confidence.
