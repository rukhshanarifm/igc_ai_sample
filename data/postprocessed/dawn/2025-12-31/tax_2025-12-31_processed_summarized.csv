https://www.dawn.com/news/1964069,FBR seals two sugar mills over tax law violation - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has sealed two sugar mills in central Punjab for serious breaches of statutory provisions, in line with the government’s zero-tolerance policy against violations of tax laws.
The enforcement action was taken following violations of Section 40C of theSales Tax Act, 1990, read with Chapter XIV-B and Chapter XIV-BA, as well as Rule 150ZQZE of theSales Tax Rules, 2006, which prescribe mandatory monitoring, control and compliance mechanisms for the sugar sector.
An official announcement issued on Monday said the action underscores the FBR’s resolve to ensure strict adherence to sales tax laws, particularly in high-risk sectors, and to take decisive measures against taxpayers involved in persistent non-compliance.
The FBR reaffirmed that all enforcement actions are being carried out strictly in accordance with the law, ensuring due process and transparency, with the objective of safeguarding government revenue and maintaining a level playing field for compliant taxpayers.
The board further reiterated its commitment to encouraging voluntary compliance, while continuing strict enforcement against wilful non-compliance and violations of tax laws.
Six officials suspended
Meanwhile, the FBR has initiated disciplinary action and immediately suspended six officials found to be unauthorisedly absent from their assigned monitoring duties at sugar mills, reaffirming its zero-tolerance policy towards misconduct and dereliction of duty.
The officials had been deployed under Section 40B of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 to ensure effective, transparent and uninterrupted monitoring of sugar production. Their absence was detected during routine monitoring and verification carried out by the Large Tax Office (LTO) Lahore, which is responsible for maintaining strict oversight of the attendance, conduct and performance of monitoring teams within its jurisdiction.
In view of the seriousness of the lapse, the LTO Lahore has proposed initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the officials concerned in accordance with applicable rules and procedures. Immediate suspension has been ordered to ensure accountability and to prevent any compromise in the monitoring process.
The FBR reiterated its commitment to maintaining the highest standards of discipline, integrity and professionalism across its field formations, warning that any dereliction of duty, misconduct or non-compliance with assigned responsibilities will be dealt with firmly and strictly under the law.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963309,FBR cracks down on healthcare tax evasion - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has intensified its enforcement drive across the country against tax evasion in the private healthcare sector by placing Inland Revenue Service (IRS) officers directly at the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, senior tax officials toldDawnon Thursday.
The move marks a shift toward on-site monitoring as authorities seek to curb underreporting of taxable income in one of the country’s most lucrative professional sectors. The initiative gained mom­entum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.
Official figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan’s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns for TY2025.
Of the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns for TY2025, only 43.20pc of those exist on tax rolls with the tax authorities, placing the profession among the least compliant sectors in the tax system.
Moreover, even among those who filed tax returns, income declarations point to widespread underreporting, raising questions about enforcement, transparency, and the credibility of declared earnings within one of the country’s most established and high earning professions.
Officers deputed at private hospitals to monitor revenue and ensure tax compliance
A senior tax official toldDawnthat the FBR has begun deploying IRS officers directly at the premises of commercial entities, including private hospitals and clinics, to strengthen monitoring and enforcement. According to the official, these officers are tasked with observing the provision of medical services and the collection of receipts in real time.
In the first phase, officers have been posted at 50 commercial hospitals under Section175-C of the Income Tax Ordinance. The objective is to identify underreporting of revenues, particularly from high inpatient occupancy charges that, in some cases, exceed the rates charged by five star hotels.
“We will identify non-compliant doctors through this exercise,” the official said, adding that private notices are being issued to encourage voluntary compliance. The official noted that voluntary compliance from doctors has already begun following the issuance of these notices.
The data place the number of registered doctors on the tax rolls at 130,243, of whom 56,287 filed income tax returns in TY2025, about 43pc of those registered. Among the filers, 48,704 doctors declared income, representing roughly 87pc of those who submitted returns.
Official figures showed that only around two in five registered doctors filed income tax returns in TY2025, with an even smaller share reporting taxable income.
However, 7,583 doctors reported zero income in their tax returns for TY2025.
Further analysis of the returns showed that 30,000 doctors of the 48,704 doctors have declared less than Rs2 million annual income, which accounted for 61.59pc of all doctors who declared taxable income in their returns. This percentage goes to 65 percent of total return filers, who declared less than Rs2 million annual income.
Moreover, most doctors fall in the lower reported income brackets.
Within the below Rs2m income bracket, the breakdown of tax returns declarations further highlights the scale of low declared earnings.
As many as 341 doctors reported annual income between Re1 and Rs100,000 in their returns, 17,647 doctors declared income ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1m, while 12,959 reported annual earnings between Rs1m and Rs2m for TY2025.
According to data, a sharp decline in the number of doctors as income levels rise. The data show 6,655 doctors fall within the Rs2m to Rs3m annual income bracket, 6,959 doctors are in the Rs3m to Rs5m range, and 3,093 doctors declared annual income between Rs5m and Rs10m.
At the highest end of the scale, only 1,050 doctors declared annual income exceeding Rs10m in TY2025.According to the FBR, statistics highlight two gaps, first between registered doctors and those filing their tax returns, and second between filers and the income levels declared with the largest concentration of declarations below Rs2m per year in TY2025.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963889,2025 OUTLOOK : Tax relief held fast by IMF restraints - Dawn,"Meaningful relief for compliant income tax payers, salaried individuals and the corporate sector — who together contribute roughly half of Pakistan’s revenues — appears unlikely. Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead.
To avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy.
Those who trust the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure.
In 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government’s economic team’s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF.
A recent media report indicates that the IMF, which is closely monitoring Pakistan’s economic trajectory, also expects tax collection to remain broadly stagnant in CY26.
There appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best
From 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratioroseto 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27.
FBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal.
Musadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. “Both the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.”
Dr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. “At best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,” he said.
A source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. “I support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF’s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.”
Dr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. “Substantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.”
He also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand.
Covering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential.
Former federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan’s economic discourse. “All we hear is ‘tax, tax, tax’, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,” he remarked.
Rehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. “There is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF’s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor.
“I expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.”
Chairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963096,IHC slams Federal Board of Revenue for ‘institutional manipulation’ - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has issued a landmark ruling condemning what it termed “institutionalised manipulation” within the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and directed its chairman to take “necessary action” against officers involved in hindering tax collection under the guise of statutes.
In a detailed 41-page judgment authored in the Huawei Technologies Pakistan Ltd case, a two-judge bench led comprising Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas declared the FBR’s attempt to extend a time-barred audit as unlawful, arbitrary, and procedurally void, while singling out the tax authority’s systemic failure to comply with statutory discipline.
The judgment asserted that “the present matter is either a classic case of institutionalised manipulation or simply negligence or incompetency.”
It went further to note that such acts by public officials “inflict greater injury upon the public exchequer than the conduct of an evading taxpayer.”
The bench pointedly ordered the court registrar to forward a certified copy of the judgment to the chairman FBR for appropriate disciplinary and administrative action in view of the findings in the order detailing alleged institutional impropriety.
The case pertained to audit proceedings for tax year 2019 relating to Huawei Technologies Pakistan Ltd, whose audit was initiated in May 2022. Under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, the statutory outer limit for completing such audit-related actions was six years — expiring on Dec 31, 2024.
On Jan 16, the FBR issued a “condonation letter” under Section 214-A of the ordinance, granting itself a six-month extension to finalise the audit. Huawei challenged this as illegal, arguing the timeline had already lapsed.
In its defence, the FBR contended that it had the general power to condone delays. However, the court found the department’s conduct revealed deeper procedural and ethical lapses amounting to deliberate manipulation of facts and law.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963196/arrangements-for-benazirs-death-anniversary-finalised,Arrangements for Benazir’s death anniversary finalised - Dawn,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Sindh President Nisar Khuhro has said that arrangements for a mammoth gathering at the Bhuttos’ mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh have been finalised to observe the 18th death anniversary of Shaheed Mohta­rma Benazir Bhutto on Saturday.
Speaking to party workers at his residence on Thursday, he said that thousands of workers from across the country would be participating in the programme to pay homage to the assassinated prime minister and other martyrs of the Bhutto family.
He said security arrangements have been made for the participants while medical camps would also be set up at the venue.
He said that President Asif Ali Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and other senior party leaders would address the gathering.
Explaining PPP’s politics to the workers, Khuhro said that the party wants implementation of the remaining clauses of the Charter of Democracy (CoD). For this purpose, he said: “truth and reconciliation is part of the PPP manifesto as well as the Charter of Democracy, but this point is yet to be implemented”.
He stressed that the PPP wants concrete progress on the pending points of the CoD, including the establishment of a truth and reconciliation mechanism.
He called for a ‘dialogue’ to establish a ‘Truth and Reconc­liation Commission’ with all political forces.
Critical about inefficiency and failure of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in meeting the set targets of tax collection, he said that it would be unwise and illogical for the federal government to punish the provinces for FBR’s failure in achieving the targets. He said Sindh was ready to collect taxes on services and goods if it was authorised. He claimed that the province could generate more revenue than the FBR and contribute a larger share to the federation.
He was a bitter opponent of any cuts in the provinces’ share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, taking stand that provinces could not be penalised by slashing their NFC allocations because of FBR’s poor and feeble performance.
Khuhro said that the party would not allow any rollback of the protection guaranteed to provinces’ shares under the 18th Constitutional Amendment, nor would it accept any attempt to undo the amendment.
He said that under the leadership of Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, the PPP had already resisted rollback of NFC Award’s key clauses through the 27th Amendment and would continue to safeguard provinces’ rights in the future as well.
He maintained that while the Constitution allows an increase in provinces’ shares in the NFC Award, it does not permit any reduction.
He said that if the federal government wants to allocate a share to Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir from the Award, it should do so from its own share.
The Sindh PPP chief categorically stated that no new provinces were being created and that there would never be a new province to be carved out from within Sindh.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963097,"ICMA lays out IMF-backed blueprint to tackle corruption, revive economy - Dawn","ISLAMABAD: The Institute of Cost and Management Accoun­tants (ICMA) on Wednesday recommended a set of measures as follow-up actions onGovernance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment(GCDA) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for governance reforms in key regulatory, fiscal and judicial sectors to stop waste of national resources and revive national economy.
In a 52-page blue print presented to the government, the body of accounting and management professionals said its report contained a set of specific proposals across 32 priority areas. “It is our professional duty and national contribution to provide this blueprint for building stronger, more transparent and accountable institutions. We stand ready to support the government, the IMF, and all stakeholders in the vital work of implementation, leveraging the expertise of our members to drive meaningful and lasting reform,” wrote ICMA vice-president Muhammad Yasin to the government.
Mr Yasin explained that ICMA review translated the IMF’s diagnostic into a phased implementation matrix, assigning a set of specific actions to responsible agencies, including the Finance Division, FBR, and SECP, with clear short-, medium-, and long-term deadlines. “This transforms high-level recommendations into an accountable, government-wide project plan, directly addressing the historic gap between reform pledges and on-the-ground execution”, he said.
The report covered five critical pillars to drive national renewal. First, it targets budget and revenue leaks that drain public resources. To address IMF concerns over opaque budgeting, the ICMA blueprint champions an independent Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) for objective scrutiny and a Public Investment Monitoring Unit (PIMU) for real-time project oversight. There should also be a Revenue Intelligence Unit (RIU) within FBR for data-driven audits and a Tax Reform and Simplification Unit to rationalise complex laws. A dedicated SOE Performance and Oversight Unit should be mandated to curb fiscal drains, while a consolidated Debt Management Office should bring transparency and discipline to national borrowing.
Next, it focused on IMF findings on judicial backlog and weak contract enforcement saying the delayed justice was hindering business and citizen rights. It called for specialized commercial benches, nationwide digital case management, and publication of court performance data. A central pillar should be the strategic expansion of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), empowering the International Mediation and Arbitration Centre (IMAC) to unclog courts. To instill integrity, a comprehensive national ethics framework with verified conflict-of-interest disclosures has been proposed.
Then it talked about strengthening accountability to fight widespread corruption. It said the new plan should tackle the fragmented anti-corruption apparatus head-on.
To counter fragmentation noted by the IMF, ICMA proposed a National Anti-Corruption Coordination Council (NACC) to unify NAB, FIA, and provincial agencies through shared intelligence.
Enhanced whistleblower protections with secure channels have been emphasized. The report calls for merit-based, transparent appointments for the heads of all key regulatory bodies (SECP, CCP, NAB) to ensure independence and effectiveness.
After that, it called for digital and regulatory reform to modernize governance for a modern state.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1964188,Traders announce countrywide protests on Jan 16 - Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Traders on Tuesday announced nationwide protests on January 16 if the directive to install point of sale (POS) devices was not withdrawn.
POS machines digitally record transactions, through touchscreen/terminal, barcode scanners, card readers, etc., and includes receipt printers. Due to POS machines all business transactions can be recorded and taxable income is easily traced by the FBR.
The announcement was made during a rally held from Aabpara Chowk to old Embassy Road against mandatory installation of POS. They tried to enter the Red Zone, but they were not allowed.
The traders had announced to hold a protest demonstration in front of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) office at Constitution Avenue, but the authorities stopped them from entering the Red Zone.
Hold rally from Aabpara Chowk to old Embassy Road against mandatory installation of POS
The rally was stopped by a heavy police contingent near Serena Hotel, following which traders staged a strong protest at the same spot and held a protest gathering.
The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran and Traders Action gathering (TAC). A large number of trader representatives and shopkeepers from Islamabad and Rawalpindi participated in the rally.
Leaders of various traders’ associations from Islamabad and Rawalpindi addressed the gathering, including representatives of market associations and chambers of small traders.
Addressing the rally, President TAC, Islamabad, Ajmal Baloch said that the government should immediately withdraw what he termed the “black law” of installing POS devices. In a fiery speech he called for the passage of legislation awarding the death penalty for corruption.
Citing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, he claimed that corruption worth Rs53 trillion occurs annually across the country, and FBR had the largest share. “These corrupt elements had now turned towards traders, and that the installation of POS machines at small shops will only create new options to fleece the traders for bribery,” Mr Baloch added.
He informed about some incidents involving FBR, that legally imported tyres worth millions of rupees were seized, with only half returned while the remainder were allegedly distributed among corrupt officials.
Ajmal Baloch also alleged that children of thousands of FBR employees were studying abroad.
“We have  a simple demand why there should not be any inquiry into their assets, claiming that even low-ranking staff own luxury vehicles worth millions of rupees,” he said. He further alleged that customs authorities had seized 26,000 non-custom-paid vehicles that were being used by bureaucrats and their relatives.
He warned that if the FBR attempted to install POS machines by force or seal any small shop in Islamabad, traders would resist strongly. The leaders of the protest announced that in the next phase of protests they plan to block Kashmir Highway and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on Jan 16.
The speakers said that if FBR continued its oppressive policies, traders would call a nationwide shutter-down strike and stage a protest at D-Chowk. They demanded the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to protect traders from corruption and high-handedness by the tax authorities.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963803,"Dr Ishrat Husain Former governor, State Bank of Pakistan - Dawn","
Pakistan made considerable progress in attaining macroeconomic stability, largely complying with the conditionalities agreed with the International Monetary Fund. This has given some semblance of confidence to the potential investors, but this is reflected mainly in the shuffling of the acquisition of ownership of existing assets by leading Pakistani business houses and some GCC companies taking over some of the foreign companies exiting the country.
Despite this, the investment rate and domestic savings rate, as well as the generation of non-debt-creating external flows, have remained below expectations, giving rise to the concern about the future growth trajectory. To find productive jobs for the two million young men and women, we would need a warranted rate of growth between six per cent to 7pc, but the projected rates in medium-term hover between 3-4pc.
The finance minister has rightly emphasised that we have to move away from an aid-dependent model to an investment-led and export-oriented model. The serious question is whether in 2026 we would witness any evidence of this change in direction by taking some tough political economy decisions that would disrupt the benefits enjoyed by the existing elites and result in a vibrant private sector and devolved local governments delivering basic public goods and services to the majority of the population.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963332,GB’s looming challenges - Dawn,"GILGIT-BALTISTAN (GB) is going to the polls next year. Theannouncementby the GB chief election commissioner was not only about general elections, it also notified the holding of the much-awaited local bodies elections. The region, with its unique civic challenges and marred by development issues, has been governed without local bodies for two decades.
This has put enormous strain on successive elected governments as people — desperate for their daily civic needs such as electricity, water, sanitation, road repairs etc — look towards their elected representatives in the GB Assembly.
As the region is governed primarily through the federal government, GB’s reliance upon the centre and the budget granted to it has increased over time. Although GB has a legislative assembly of its own, the key decisions rest with the centre and its powerful bureaucracy.
This reliance is one of the reasons why the candidates and the voters in some cases look towards the ruling party in the centre before elections. This results in political defections in GB which have become a norm and are neither considered unethical nor immoral. While the defections generally occur before elections (as is currently happening) the outgoing government faced them within three years of coming into power. As the wind changed in the centre due to the no-confidence vote, the fate of the then-ruling PTI in GB was also sealed.
The then-GB CM and PTI’s regional president Khalid Khursheed Khan was disqualified by the GB Chief Court on the basis of obtaining a fake degree. Consequently, political instability, wrangling and defections have cast a shadow over the outgoing government.
The defections also do not matter much in the local context of GB. Voters in many constituencies, if not all, vote for the influential and prominent political figures who are well-known in the community and in a few cases, due to tribal affinity. Since the region desperately needs development, hence the ruling party in the centre is the best pick for these candidates. Before elections, the parties announce development schemes to tilt voters in their favour. The infrastructure of GB demands urgent attention. Due to difficult terrain, it deserves special focus which the successive governments have failed to deliver.
The region’s key decisions rest with the centre and its powerful bureaucracy.
Decades of neglect in the public health system have resulted in lack of health facilities, functioning laboratories, life-saving equipment, and availability of doctors across GB.
People in many cases take patients to what they call ‘down country’ for treatment, putting an additional burden on their finances. Even the basic facilities such as electricity, clean water and sanitation remain rare in many areas. Despite all these challenges, including a limited budget, the push to create more districts in GB is strange. In some areas, with a population of less than 50,000, carving out a district puts an additional burden on the limited budget. GB now pays more in salaries and spends less on its development, which should be the other way around.
A further burden on already meagre resources is tourism. While the recent boom in tourism and hordes of tourists arriving in GB has brought short-term benefits to the local population, the carbon footprint of these people and their vehicles has already started affecting the weather. GB is an ecologically fragile area. It cannot cater to mass tourism. GB needs a rational policy toward ecotourism and its implementation, benefitting local communities and the natural environment.
Taking tourists to mountain tops in a five-door jeep is not wise, neither are concrete hotels and guesthouses without proper sewerage and garbage disposal systems. Unfortunately, this is what has been done to GB in the name of promoting tourism which is evidently changing the region’s fragile weather.
The elephant is in the room now. In the last few years, flash floods have destroyed homes, bridges, hundreds of hectares of agricultural land and displaced population of several villages.
This year, Ghizer, Ghanche, Skardu and other areas faced unprecedented floods that deprived many people of their livelihoods. The incoming government will have to confront these challenges and formulate effective and long-term policies to provide meaningful relief to the population. Not to forget, GB has a large educated, yet unemployed youth population which will likely place significant pressure on the government for effective governance. A glimpse of this has been witnessed in the past five years, when the region was embroiled in mass demonstrations and large sit-ins over one issue or the other.
These protests were against the state’s attempt to end the wheat subsidy given to GB, and to impose tax. Sharp criticism was made of theGB Land Reforms Act of 2025and against the arrests of leaders of the Awami Action Committee — vocal against certain government decisions — by civil society activists as well as political and religious circles. The longest sit-in of almost two months at the Sost dry port by GB traders and businessmen against the government’s effort to impose sales tax, advance income tax, and federal excise duty through FBR, resulted in the decision to exempt imports worth up to Rs4 billion from federal taxes if the goods are for local consumption.
The protesters demanded representation in the national legislature as a precondition to impose tax. The federal government’s move reopened the old wound and regenerated the debate of the region’s constitutional status and parliamentary representation.
Whether the incoming government will be able to resolve the chronic issue of GB’s representation is yet to be seen. While the future of GB remains uncertain, the formulation and implementation of effective and inclusive policies have the potential to mitigate the looming crises and place GB on a more stable and sustainable path.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1962570,"Tax-to-GDP ratio to stall over five years, IMF expects - Dawn","ISLAMABAD: With a 1.4 percentage-point increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio last year, mostly through additional revenue measures worth Rs2.5 trillion, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) now expects the federal tax contribution to remain stagnant over the next five years and a slight improvement coming from provinces.
The latest IMF estimates suggest Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) receipts rose from 8.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023-24 to 10.3pc in 2024-25, but still missed the Fund’s programme target of 10.7pc.
For the current fiscal year, the IMF projects FBR revenue at 11.1pc of GDP, which would then remain flat at that level until FY30.
In absolute terms, FBR revenue increased from Rs9.3tr in FY24 to Rs11.74tr in FY25, with a massive shortfall. For the current year, collections are projected at Rs13.98tr, implying a shortfall of Rs328 billion under existing assumptions.
The IMF noted that tax revenue collection in FY25 fell short by Rs1.224tr relative to budget projections and by Rs524bn relative to the lender’s first review target. About Rs850bn of the shortfall relative to the budget reflected faster-than-expected inflation deceleration and lower-than-expected GDP growth in FY25.
Forecasts provincial taxes to offset stagnant federal collections
The inflation deceleration at the end of FY25 led to a revenue shortfall of Rs157bn relative to the first IMF review target. The remaining portion of about Rs380bn was broadly linked to administrative and enforcement challenges that remained unaddressed throughout FY25, chiefly because of prolonged settlement of tax court cases that delayed the recovery of significant revenue amounts.
Overall revenues, including non-tax receipts, rose sharply to 15.9pc of GDP by the end of FY25 from 12.6pc in FY24. The Fund attributed the increase mainly to stronger receipts from the petroleum levy and State Bank profits.
The IMF expects the petroleum levy to remain a key source of revenue, rising from Rs1.02tr in FY24 to more than Rs2.2tr by FY30. It projected the levy’s contribution at about 1.1pc of GDP over the medium term, rising to around 1.2pc in the current and next fiscal years before easing back.
The Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30, while the sales tax ratio is expected to hover around its existing level of 3.5-3.6pc of GDP.
It said major contributions are projected to come from provincial taxes on the expectations of successful implementation of the agriculture income tax and sales taxes on services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to increase from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27, rise further to 1.6pc of GDP in FY28 and then stay flat until FY30.
In absolute numbers, the four provinces that collected Rs929bn in FY25 are expected to deliver Rs1.22tr during the current fiscal and further improve their collection to Rs1.77tr in FY27. They would build upon this base to collect Rs2.5tr in FY28, Rs2.8tr in FY29 and cross Rs3.1tr in FY30.
The Fund said projected FBR collections would depend on advancing reforms to raise revenues through tax policy simplification and base broadening, supporting fiscal sustainability and creating space for climate resilience, social protection, human capital development and public investment.
It noted that FBR revenues rose 26pc year-on-year in FY25 to 10.3pc of GDP, a historically high level, but overall tax revenue still fell short of the target by 0.3pc of GDP, largely due to delays in resolving court cases over disputed taxes (0.4pc of GDP) and lower-than-expected inflation. Lower-than-budgeted federal subsidies and grants, estimated at 0.2pc of GDP, helped offset the impact of the revenue shortfall.
The IMF said provinces had begun implementing new agricultural income tax (AIT) regimes, including measures to strengthen compliance and address underreporting.
“However, significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, notably fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities,” the Fund observed, adding that the provinces have also ensured that all services, except for a limited list of exemptions, are subject to GST.
It said the cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc, as has been the case for Pakistan over a long time.
In this way, the Fund projected the consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.4pc of GDP in FY25, easing to 4pc this year, before declining to 3.2pc in FY27 and FY28, and then to 2.8pc in FY30.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963500,"ADR falls to 35pc, IDR goes up to 100pc - Dawn","• Report finds lending to private sector lowest in Pakistan• Undocumented economy is 40pc of GDP
KARACHI: The advances to deposits ratio (ADR) further declined from 50 per cent in December 2024 to just 35pc as of June this year, while the investments to deposits ratio (IDR) surged from 90pc to 100pc during the same period, according to a report.
The Banking Publication 2025 titled “Banking Forward: Journeying Towards Future Horizons”releasedby PwC-A.F. Ferguson on Friday said Pakistan’s ADR remains significantly lower than Bang­la­desh at 87pc, India at 79pc and Sri Lanka at 59pc. In contrast, Pakistan’s IDR of 100pc is much higher than Bangladesh at 29pc, India at 33pc and Sri Lanka at 47pc.
According to the report, priority sector financing continues to remain at sub-optimal levels, with SME contribution to total loans at 3.7pc and agriculture at 4pc. In comparison, SME lending as a percentage of total loans is considerably higher in other countries, including Indonesia at 19pc, Bangladesh at 17pc and India at 16pc.
Meanwhile, lending to the private sector declined to 11pc of GDP in 2024. Con­versely, the IDR has increased sharply, rising from 40pc in 2010 to 93pc in 2024 and reaching 100pc as of June 2025.
According to the report, SMEs and the agriculture sector are central to Pakistan’s economy, together representing millions of enterprises across both formal and informal segments. Agriculture contributes 24pc to GDP, while SMEs account for 40pc of GDP, 90pc of enterprises, 30pc of export earnings and employ nearly 30pc of the workforce.
Agricultural borrowers increased by 200,000, reaching 2.9 million by June 2025, while SME borrowers rose by over 55pc to 277,000 during the same period.
The report said industry experts emphasised that a large share of Pakistan’s transactions remains cash-based, contributing to an undocumented economy estimated at 40pc of GDP. Digitising a portion of these transactions could save Rs164 billion annually, while reducing the undocumented economy by 25pc has the potential to unlock over Rs1 trillion in resources, the report added.
As of June 2025, agricultural financing rose to Rs739bn, accounting for 5.2pc of total loans, up from 3.4pc in December 2024. SME lending increased to Rs712bn, representing 5pc of total loans.
Recent initiatives by the regulator and the industry have led to notable progress, with financing to priority sectors surpassing 10pc of total loans, indicating a reversal of historical declining trends. “Despite this positive trend, financing levels remain low compared to regional peers, highlighting the need for expanded credit interventions,” the report said.
Experts also emphasised the need for sustained fiscal discipline, comprehensive tax reforms, improved governance of state-owned enterprises and reduced government debt to maintain and strengthen economic progress, according to the report. “The urgent need to diversify and expand exports has been stressed upon, advocating a shift from consumption-driven growth to a value-added export base,” it added.
Experts further highlighted that boosting domestic investment and productivity is critical for successful import substitution, which requires removing bureaucra­tic hurdles, simplifying regulations and cre­­ating an investor-friendly environment.
Cash continues to pose a challenge to financial inclusion and digitisation, with Pakistan’s cash-in-circulation ratio at 34pc, compared to Bangladesh at 16pc, India at 15pc and Kenya at 9pc, the report noted.
In Pakistan, paper-based transactions account for 14pc of total transactions, while ATM traffic constitutes 25pc of e-transactions.
“There is greater need for broader government and regulatory push to create a wider ecosystem that incentivises digital and disincentivises cash,” the report said.
The report added that the State Bank of Pakistan’s instant payment system, Raast, recorded 45 million registered IDs by June 2025 and processed 1.3bn transactions worth Rs29.6tr, more than doubling in both volume and value compared to the previous year. It said the number of QR-enabled merchants also crossed one million, twice as many as a year earlier.
However, adoption remains uneven across the economy. Only about 159,000 merchants currently use point-of-sale terminals, far fewer than in comparable emerging markets, while mobile banking penetration stands at roughly 15pc of total bank accounts, the report said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963807,2026 OUTLOOK: Journey of highs and lows - Dawn,"The year 2025 was exceptional for Pakistan’s geoeconomics and geopolitics. The most dramatic moment was the May 7–10conflictwith India, a confrontation whose political and economic repercussions continue to shape Pakistan’s trajectory. In its aftermath, Pakistan emerged more confident, actively pursuing defence and strategic economic partnerships to reinforce its long-term security.
The economy also saw a significant improvement in global perception, reflected in successive upgrades by major international rating agencies, including Fitch, S&P, and Moody’s. These upgrades noted strengthened macroeconomic stability, an improved external position, and steadier foreign exchange reserves. The primary balance, showing that the government’s revenues exceed its non-interest expenditures, rose to a historic high of 2.4 per cent of GDP. Equally notable was the sharp decline in headline inflation, which fell below 5pc, its lowest level in seven years.
The launch of a new, outward-looking trade policy, signalling a decisive break from decades of protectionism, is one of the most consequential reforms. The five-year policy aims to make Pakistan one of the most open economies in the region by eliminating para-tariffs, streamlining exemptions, simplifying the tax structure, capping the maximum rate at 15pc, and reducing tariffs on nearly half of all tariff lines, with almost half going to zero. If fully implemented, it would rank Pakistan among the world’s most ambitious tariff reformers over the past two decades, according to the World Bank, sending a strong signal of commitment to competitiveness, global integration, and export-led growth.
Another highlight of the year was the financial closure of the Reko Diq copper-and-gold project in Balochistan, achieved nearly 15 years after completion of the feasibility study — including the six years lost to litigation. The $7 billion project is backed by a strong consortium of sponsors, including the International Finance Corporation, the Asian Development Bank, and financial institutions from the US, Canada, Japan, and Saudi Arabia.
Though much has yet to be achieved on the social front, the year offered a boost not only to homegrown economics but also to Pakistan’s international stature
Construction activity is expected to gather pace in early 2026 as well, with commercial production projected to begin in 2028, potentially generating around $2.5bn annually in export earnings.
After a hiatus of nearly two decades, Pakistan has revived its long-stalled privatisation agenda, starting with the sale of the debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to aprivate consortium.
For years, PIA stood as a symbol of chronic mismanagement, political interference, and persistent fiscal hemorrhaging, with accumulated losses estimated at more than $2.5bn, imposing a heavy and recurrent burden on the national exchequer. The transaction represents a notable policy inflection, signalling the government’s readiness to take politically difficult decisions to curb losses, restore efficiency, and progressively reduce the state’s footprint in commercial activity.
Moreover, Pakistan’s stock market continued a stunning surge in 2025, with the KSE-100 Index beating all previous records to an all-time high of over 170,000 points and earning a place among the world’s top-performing markets.Bloombergranked Pakistan “among the best-performing markets globally,” noting that its returns outpaced nearly every major index. Barron’s went a step further, hailing the turnaround as a rare “mini miracle,” fuelled by reforms, macroeconomic stabilisation, and a decisive return of investor confidence.
Yet, the year was not without setbacks. Agricultural growth suffered a sharp downturn, falling from 6.4pc in FY24 to just 1.5pc in FY25. Major crops were severely affected, including cotton declining by over 30pc, maize by 15pc, and wheat by 9pc. This contraction slowed the anticipated reduction in poverty rates and underscored the continued vulnerability of the agricultural sector.
Another low point was Pakistan’s unemployment rate, whichroseto 7.1pc in FY25, the highest level in 21 years, underscoring the economy’s failure to generate productive jobs. Compared to 64pc males, only 18pc females are employed as per the Labor Force Survey. Six in 10 Master’s-degree-holder women are not currently employed. The combination of high unemployment and widespread unpaid work highlights the urgency of growth strategies that can create decent, paid jobs, especially for women and youth, and convert hidden labour into productive economic participation.
Perhaps the lowest point for Pakistan is its fall to the very bottom of the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Index 2025, ranking 148 out of 148 countries. This stark outcome signals a clear deterioration in women’s economic participation, widening wage inequality, and an alarmingly weak presence of women in decision-making.
Pakistan’s poor performance is the result of structural constraints such as persistent barriers to women’s entry into the economy and governance, weak implementation of gender-inclusive policies, and entrenched sociocultural norms.

The real estate and construction sector has lots of potential in a country like Pakistan. Notably, over 12m Pakistanis are working in different countries of the world who, last year, sent remittances worth $38 billion to their families. More than 52 per cent of this is used for buying real estate and investing in the construction industry. As per the World Bank, the shortage of housing in the country is around 14m units. In spite of the opportunity, 2026 may again be challenging, like the past three years, due to the high interest rates and taxes on the industry, too much documentation, inconsistent policies, non-availability of finance at subsidised rates for the first-time homebuyer, increasing cost of construction material, stiff competition from Dubai, political instability, and non-digitalisation of land records including approval processes.
The housing and construction industry is capital-intensive, and needs support; Unfortunately, it is not on the government’s priority list. The sector needs a long-term policy, prepared with the input of the stakeholders. If the government is able to address the earlier-mentioned issues, this industry can contribute 10pc or more to the national GDP, thereby creating employment, economic, and revenue generation opportunities, including providing a decent roof at an economical price for every Pakistani family.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963143,Education roundup 2025 - Dawn,"AS another year ends, it is worth looking back and taking stock of significant developments in Pakistan’s education sector. While many small-scale interventions and pilot projects are ongoing, I will restrict my review to wide-scale developments that are more likely to have a perceptible impact, good or bad.
The widely quoted figure of25 million out-of-school children, the one that prompted this government to announce an “education emergency,” has been bumped up to an estimated 26m. Meanwhile, public spending on education remains stuck at 0.8 per cent of GDP. Instead, according to a news report just this week, the government’s best idea is to gently twist private businesses’ arm to make them pledge one per cent of their profits for the cause of education, presumably because levied taxes (paid or evaded) and additional costs of doing business in this country are not high enough. Never has a country, certainly no country of a quarter billion souls, righted its ship of public education on the back of corporate charitable giving.
For a positive development, the national Inter Boards Coordination Commission (IBCC)announceda notable increase in flexibility. SSC and HSSC students will now be able to select individual subjects, instead of being restricted to pre-set tracks, i.e. arts, (general) science, pre-engineering, and pre-medical, like in many other foreign school systems. Students advancing to HSSC will not be constrained in their choice by what SSC subjects they took, i.e. anyone who opted for arts subjects at the SSC level could still take subjects needed for admission to medical or engineering programmes. It may require catching up in some subjects, but it will be an option. It is a welcome development, because how certain can we expect 14-year-olds starting SSC or 16-year-olds starting HSSC to be about the future course of their academic year?
A widely debated development is the Punjab government’s ongoingprivatisationof a large portion of its 48,000 public schools. So far, the management of 12,500 public primary and middle schools has already been transferred to private entities, primarily education sector NGOs, with another 4,500 announced in the upcoming phase, which, for the first time, will include 70 of the province’s 550 inter colleges. Students at schools with low enrolment have been reassigned to nearby schools. Similarly, teachers have been transferred to other schools or placed in the surplus pool. Unsurprisingly, there is pushback from teacher unions, but schools do not exist solely for the purpose of providing livelihoods for teachers. What we know for certain is that, for decades, most public schools have failed to deliver on their mission of educating children and that successive governments have been unable to reverse the decline. It was high-time for a radical change, and I look forward to seeing the outcome evaluations of this programme.
Never has a country righted its ship of public education on the back of charity.
Sindh has decided to go a different route to deal with its inability to improve public school education and announced the introduction of IGCSE / A-level education tracks in one public school of every district.
A big development that almost was but did not come to pass, but may yet come to be, is the reversal of the devolution of education to provinces. The recentralisation of education as a subject to the centre was mentioned during early negotiations of the27th Amendment. Speculatively, while it is on the wish list, it was not high up enough on the list of priorities to be included in the ratified version. Now, there are rumours swirling about yet another, a 28th amendment, with the two key priorities of changing the NFC and bringing education back to the centre. While provinces are certainly expected to put up a fight on the issue of the NFC, having accomplished little to nothing in education since the 18th Amendment gave them control, they are expected to be glad for the federal government to take the responsibility of developing curricula off their hands.
Another important development affecting students seeking to study abroad has been the tightening of student visa requirements. Last month, the Institute of International Education’s Fall 2025 snapshot report showed that in the US, enrolment of new international students is down by 17pcover last year. This drop has been attributed to the Trump administration’s changes to student visa rules.
In the UK, similar measures have already led a few universities to suspend or significantly tighten admissions for applicants from Pakistan entirely. The Home Office tracks and limits the rate at which applications for student visas are rejected for every UK university to prevent abuse of the visa system by international students who overstay or apply for asylum. According to revised rules, universities whose student visa application rejectionswill exceed the 5pc thresholdwill lose the right to host international students. Since Pakistani students are counted among the biggest offenders, several universities no longer consider applicants from Pakistan. This is a case of bad actors ruining opportunities for all genuine applicants from the country.
Any review of education news in 2025 must acknowledge the rapid advancement of AI. Tech execs of companies leading the AI revolution, thought leaders, and leading universities and school systems have not been able to converge on a consensus on how AI tools will be incorporated into learning and how it will change the sector as a whole.
Meanwhile, in several conversations I had with people in the bureaucracy, in their infinite wisdom and foresight, they have already declared that AI-powered learning tools will sweep through schools and universities transforming the education sector as we know it, solving all problems and, having nothing to offer, are happy to fold their arms, lean back, and just watch as passive observers!
In conclusion, what is life without a little conflict, sentimentality, and betrayal of a soap opera? That is why I feel it necessary to acknowledge the low-level hubbub created every time an HEC chair steps down and the horse race of vice-chancellors for the replacement begins. The rumour is that the shortlist has been cut down to three candidates, and the announcement of who is going to be the next HEC chair is imminent. Until next year, we watch, wait, and hope that the next chapter brings more substance than spectacle.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1962949,Stalled tax effort - Dawn,"PAKISTAN’S tax effort appears to have plateaued. Or so the latest IMF projections stress. After a jump of 1.4 percentage points in the tax-to-GDP ratio to 10.3pc in FY25, largely through additional revenue-enhancing measures that mostly burdened captive taxpayers — the salaried class and compliant businesses — the FBR tax collection as a ratio of the country’s GDP is projected to stagnate for the next five years. The only modest gains, if any, will likely come from provinces, and that too if they decide to effectively tax agriculture income and services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to jump from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27 and further to 1.6pc in FY28 before flattening until FY30. Overall, the country’s tax revenues are projected to flatten at 11.1pc of GDP — much below the 13.3pc mark the government has committed to achieve during the current IMF programme period — all the way through FY30. What the lender is signalling is that the government has ‘exhausted’ its option to raise taxation without fixing the underlying structural problems and better enforcement, or further burdening compliant sectors of the economy, or both.
The government’s growing dependence on non-tax revenue to prop up its fiscal position should be particularly concerning. Though the total government revenues surged to nearly 16pc of GDP in FY25, this increase has not resulted from the expansion of the tax base but from heavy petroleum levy and the State Bank’s profits. The levy has quietly morphed into a permanent quasi-tax on consumption in recent years, disproportionately burdening low-middle-income households. Another worrying fact is that Pakistan’s inequitable tax policy, which is over- reliant on indirect taxes while under-taxing or not taxing certain powerful lobbies, is likely to persist at the expense of economic growth and investment. That Pakistan’s economic growth depends on its ability to boost tax-to-GDP ratio is confirmed by cross-country evidence cited by the Fund: countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc — precisely where Pakistan has been for a while and appears destined to remain. In sum, faster economic growth will remain a pipe dream until fiscal consolidation is achieved through structural reforms instead of what many call stealth taxation.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963550,Bilawal urges greater role for provinces as solution to Centre’s financial woes - Dawn,"PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday urged giving the provinces a greater role in areas such as tax collection to help address the federal government’s financial issues.
The Bhutto scion was addressing the death anniversary programme for his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Benazir wasassassinatedin a gun-and-bomb attack near Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007, after a public gathering.
The Sindh government announced apublic holidaytoday to commemorate Benazir’s death anniversary.Foolproof securityfor the VVIPs, VIPs, and general public was ensured in Larkana, with over 8,500 police officers and personnel, alongside Rangers and other security agencies, deployed at and around Bhutto’s mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh.
Speaking at the event, Bilawal said the PPP was a federal party that conducted politics at both the national and provincial levels with sincerity, treating the Centre’s problems as its own.
“If there is an issue of fiscal space for the federal government, then as a patriot, I would want to help solve it. The PPP has its own politics and history, and as the chain binding the four provinces, we have a greater responsibility to address the Centre’s issues while protecting provincial rights.”
“We think that instead of attempts to take authority away from the provinces, it would be better if the federal government gave more responsibilities to them. We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government’s issues.”
Pointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue.
“We will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crises.”
Bilawal maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces.
“We will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan’s economic problems together so we can improve the people’s financial situation.”
On his mother, Bilawal said her last message was one of reconciliation. He added that reconciliation would be necessary to resolve the country’s current political crisis.
The Bhutto scion said that parties would have to abandon “political extremism” for the reconciliation effort to succeed, and their supporters would need to bring politics back within bounds. He added that actions such as the May 9, 2023, nationwide riots or cursing institutional heads were not the way forward.
He said Benazir and the PPP had never pursued the politics of revenge, as it caused losses to the country, its people, and the party’s supporters.
“Political forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.”
In his speech, the president said today marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir’s assassination.
He also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a “befitting response” to the enemy, making it realise that it was serious.
“Modi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.”
He warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, “they should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation”.
In an earliermessageon his wife’s death anniversary, the president said: “As we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.”
He stressed that Benazir “never believed in vindictiveness and vendetta”.
“She always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,” he said.
“On her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,“ he added.
Recalling that Benazir was the first female prime minister of a Muslim country and had been elected twice to the role, Zardari said: “In a political landscape shaped by exclusion, patriarchy, longer authoritarian rule and repeated disruptions of democratic order, she stood like a rock for the supremacy of the Constitution, authority of the Parliament and the peoples’ right to choose their representatives.
“Her repeated return to electoral politics reflected an unshakeable faith in peaceful political struggle and unadulterated democracy,” he asserted.
“She gave voice to the voiceless. She pulled farmers, workers and low-income families like a super magnet towards her, who remained at the centre of her politics,” the president highlighted, pointing out Benazir’s focus on widening access to livelihoods and education.
“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,” President Zardari said about his late wife.
“Her courage in the face of extremism remains one of her most enduring legacies,” he further said, adding that Benazir’s assassination was a “reminder that the fight against terrorism is not only about security, but also about ideas, education and respect for diversity”.
“For the youth of Pakistan, her life offers a clear lesson. Speak up for justice, organise peacefully and do not surrender hope in the face of adversity. She confronted censorship and repression with resolve, proving that truth cannot be silenced forever.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to her, saying her political legacy was marked by patriotism, courage, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values,Radio Pakistanreported.
He said she consistently promoted tolerance, harmony, and forbearance in the political process, which remained a guiding principle for strengthening democracy in the country.
PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the government’s resolve to continue the journey of tolerance, rule of law, democratic governance, and public welfare.
Bilawal, in amessagereleased by the PPP yesterday, said his mother’s “supreme sacrifice was a pledge written in blood that democracy in Pakistan would never surrender”.
“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was not just a leader; she was the fearless voice of democracy, the hope of the oppressed and an unyielding symbol of resistance against dictatorship, extremism and intolerance,” he was quoted as saying.
Reaffirming the PPP’s unwavering commitment to Benazir’s mission, Bilawal said the party will continue to fight for social and economic justice, constitutional supremacy, women’s empowerment and the protection of minorities.
“We bow our heads in reverence before Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Her sacrifice is our strength, her vision our guiding light and her courage our lasting responsibility. Her dream lives on in every voice raised for justice and every step taken for democracy,” the PPP scion said.
Bilawal went on to say that Benazir’s vision of a “peaceful, democratic and inclusive Pakistan continues to inspire generations, especially women and youth”.
He noted that as the premier, his mother “pursued people-centred policies, strengthened Pakistan’s defence, safeguarded national sovereignty and restored the country’s progressive and dignified image internationally”.
Benazir‘s daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, whopaid a visitto her mother’s mausoleum yesterday, said on social media platform X: “Today we remember Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.
“She lived with courage and led with compassion. Her strength lives on in every voice that refuses injustice.”
Aseefa further said, “In every struggle and every accomplishment, we think of you, miss you, and pray for you. We continue to strive to fulfil your vision and values. Your absence leaves us searching for the guidance only you could give.”
Senator Sherry Rehman posted a video message on her X account, saying that Benazir “never wavered, she never compromised on her dreams for her beloved Pakistan”.
“Despite all threats, risks and real dangers, she did what she believed in. Her courage and resilience define her as one of the greatest leaders the world saw,” Rehman said, adding that her vision lives on in the hands of Bilawal, Aseefa and President Zardari.
Meanwhile, a government delegation led by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, has departed for Garhi Khuda Bakhsh to attend the gathering being held to mark Benazir’s death anniversary.
The delegation, including Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, and MNAs, is attending on the special instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The delegation will also hold meetings with the PPP leadership.
In a statement released prior to his departure, Sadiq said, “Today we are commemorating the death anniversary of Pakistan’s great daughter, former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed.”
He said Benazir had played a significant role in strengthening the role of women, adding she worked to make Pakistan a peaceful, progressive, and democratic state.
“Her sacrifices and services are a guiding light for the entire nation,“ he said.","Sat, 27 Dec 2025 07:15:16 GMT",,"PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari urged giving the provinces a greater role in areas such as tax collection.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963800,2026 Agriculture: Remaining rudderless - Dawn,"
This year proved particularly harsh for Pakistan’s agriculture sector. Government policies drove up input costs, reduced exports, and depressed domestic crop prices, whereas climate change adversely affected crop yields. Taken together, farmers of all major crops suffered badly.
Wheat prices fell by up to Rs2,000 per 40 kg when the government abruptly discontinued both the support price and procurement from farmers, without putting in place any alternative mechanisms to manage the annual supply glut during the harvest period. Likewise, cotton farm-gate prices declined due to an 18 per cent sales tax on locally produced cotton, selectively, whereas imports remained exempt until the end of July 2025.
Similarly, in 2025, the government scrapped its long-standing policy of announcing an indicative sugarcane price. As a result, sugar mills are paying farmers rates that neither align with crop expenses nor reflect prevailing sugar market prices.
Maize and rice yields were hit by climate change, while their market prices were depressed by the closure of the Afghanistan border. The border disruption also severely curtailed exports of citrus, potatoes, and other crops to Afghanistan and Central Asian markets, triggering a considerable decline in domestic prices. Sesame proved to be another loss-making crop due to weak global prices and erratic rainfall.
An underwhelming seed sector, water insecurity and a narrow agri export market will pose challenges to the sector in the coming year
In 2025, farmers have lost much of their cost competitiveness due to higher input costs, policy failures, and weather vagaries. In view of all these, they are not very optimistic about 2026. Many fear that the situation could worsen further in the years ahead as new challenges have come into play.
First, the government has recently assured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it will raise duties on fertilisers and pesticides — the two major cost components of crop production — if tax collection falls short. Such a move would sharply escalate production costs and could pose an existential threat to the agriculture sector.
Second, the intensity and frequency of erratic rainfalls and heat waves are rising, alongside increasing temperatures, which will continue to erode crop yields. With monsoon rainfall projected to rise by 22–26pc, floods are again feared in 2026. Yet, there is no visible improvement in flood preparedness or mitigation measures.
Third, unlike many comparable countries that levy minimal or no taxation, Pakistan — under IMF directives — will raise the agricultural income tax from the existing 15pc to as high as 45pc, effective from FY26. Farmers, who are the primary investors in the sector, particularly for upgrading farm practices and mechanisation, will likely see their on-farm investments suppressed. This decision comes at a time when farm sizes are shrinking, and both crop production and market risks are intensifying due to climate change and price volatility.
Fourth, if the Afghanistan border remains closed into 2026, both raw and value-added products of many crops will face significant setbacks. Under current farming practices, the sector is ill-prepared to access alternative export markets and to comply with their stringent sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards. A prolonged border closure would therefore create widespread gluts in the country that would result in severe losses for farmers.
Fifth, earlier in the year, India unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty and disrupted the Chenab river flow by abruptly holding and releasing water. Such irregular flows badly affect the crops. Looking ahead, any future reduction in river flows — while Pakistan already struggles to distribute water equitably among provinces — could severely impact those regions that rely solely on canal water.
In such a precarious and fragile situation, the pressing question is: what is the way forward, and which targeted interventions are needed to stabilise the agriculture sector?
Most importantly, the top priority should be to enhance farmers’ access to high-yielding, climate-resilient seeds because higher productivity is the only viable way to partially offset rising production costs and heavier taxation. For this, Pakistan needs a dynamic seed sector where the public and private sector (national and multinational seed companies) undertake research and development and market their quality seed freely. However, this will require a highly robust seed regulatory mechanism.
Water shortages pose an impending threat to Pakistan’s agriculture. To offset potential reductions in river flows from India and Afghanistan — where several dams are in the pipeline — Pakistan must significantly expand its water storage capacity. Simultaneously, the widespread adoption of high-efficiency irrigation systems along with rainwater harvesting to recharge groundwater is essential, as reliance on groundwater is bound to increase in the coming years.
Pakistan must actively explore and tap into new export markets to manage its export surplus. However, to comply with their sanitary and phytosanitary standards, we need to upgrade our farm practices, which is far from easy. At the very least, export-oriented clusters can be developed in collaboration with the private sector, where crops — particularly high-value, non-traditional ones — are grown under contract farming arrangements and processed into value-added products.
Despite these mounting challenges — directly affecting the country’s food security, agricultural exports, employment generation, and poverty — the government’s response remains confined to short-term, headline-friendly interventions such as small bank loans, ballot-based distribution of tractors, solar tubewells and farm implements, model agricultural malls, and short-term training of 1,000 agri-graduates in China, even as hundreds of highly qualified PhDs and MPhils remain unemployed in the country.
What Pakistan urgently needs are focused and sustained investments in strengthening its seed sector, improving water resources, and upgrading on-farm practices to enhance yields and exports. However, given the ongoing political turmoil in the country and the government’s preference for optics-driven quick wins, these critical priorities are unlikely to get due attention. Consequently, the agriculture sector would remain rudderless, without a clear vision or direction.

THERE has been another wave of criticism and an extensive campaign by local auto-assemblers and parts manufacturers over the increasing import of vehicles, particularly used cars brought in under the gift scheme. Despite the industry’s vocal objections, demand for imported used vehicles continues to surge.
The massive appeal for used imported vehicles is not without valid reasons. Consumers widely believe these cars offer better reliability, features and safety compared to locally-assembled options. Industry protection measures, including high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, have existed for decades. Yet, even with this long-standing support, the local industry has struggled to achieve meaningful levels of true localisation.
According to the latest State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, vehicle-related imports, both complete knocked-down (CKD) and complete built-up (CBU) versions, contribute heavily to foreign exchange outflows. Imports under HS Code 87 alone accounted for roughly $2 billion in 2024-25. In addition, substantial foreign exchange is spent on importing raw materials, such as steel sheets, plastics and chemical components, indicating that local value addition remains minimal. In contrast, used vehicles are a source of elusive forex reserves as well as a handsome amount of revenue that is collected as duties and taxes.
While the government’s import policy has traditionally favoured domestic manu-facturers through extensive protection and taxation, especially on fully built units, the demand to impose a blanket ban on used car imports raises questions of fairness.
Imported used vehicles consistently deliver better safety, durability and overall quality, areas where local assemblers continue to fall short. For consumers, these imports offer an alternative that pushes local producers to improve quality and price.
Too much of everything is bad, and the same holds for the protection of auto- assembling and parts manufacturing units. For a long time, consumers have not been provided enough options locally. Previously, there used to be only three to four local giants. Although with the introduction of Chinese brands, the market has expanded with new models, it needs to be seen how these companies will cope with the introduction of new energy vehicles (NEVs) instead of relying on technologies that are decade old.
It is a fact that a CBU imported car will always be cheaper than a car assembled as CKD. An NEV, hybrid or EV, would always have lesser impact on forex outflows unless we attain 80-90 per cent localisation, or we are strong enough to export. Given our track record, both scenarios remain highly unlikely. Experts also note that allowing commercial imports will not address consumer affordability. Although it may serve as a non-tariff barrier, it is unlikely to influence car prices in the domestic market in any meaningful way.
The government should not succumb to threats, propaganda and campaigns of auto-assemblers and parts manufacturers. Some sort of pressure should always be there to reap the true benefits of competitiveness, which may ultimately provide some sort of relief for customers and local industry.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963889/2025-outlook-tax-relief-held-fast-by-imf-restraints,2025 OUTLOOK : Tax relief held fast by IMF restraints - Dawn,"Meaningful relief for compliant income tax payers, salaried individuals and the corporate sector — who together contribute roughly half of Pakistan’s revenues — appears unlikely. Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead.
To avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy.
Those who trust the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure.
In 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government’s economic team’s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF.
A recent media report indicates that the IMF, which is closely monitoring Pakistan’s economic trajectory, also expects tax collection to remain broadly stagnant in CY26.
There appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best
From 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratioroseto 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27.
FBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal.
Musadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. “Both the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.”
Dr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. “At best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,” he said.
A source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. “I support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF’s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.”
Dr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. “Substantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.”
He also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand.
Covering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential.
Former federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan’s economic discourse. “All we hear is ‘tax, tax, tax’, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,” he remarked.
Rehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. “There is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF’s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor.
“I expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.”
Chairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963390,What men actually want as gifts — not mugs - Dawn,"Buying gifts for men should be easy, right? You walk into a store, grab something in leather or metal — a wallet, a watch, maybe a bottle of perfume that smells “fresh and manly”, and you’re done. Safe, predictable, problem solved.
Except, it’s not. Because when it comes to gifting men, there’s this generic paradox. Everyone thinks it’s simple, yet most men end up with things they neither want nor use.
Well, we all know the holy trinity of male gifts — watches, perfumes, and shoes, but perhaps it’s time to retire them. So, we decided to ask a few men what they actually want as gifts. The answers were funny, practical, a little bitter, and somewhat relatable.
Zareef, a part-time cartoonist, began his confession with dry honesty: “I often don’t get gifts. But not getting gifts doesn’t bother me much. What bothers me is getting gifts I can’t use, like fancy mugs or flashy ties. I already have seven fancy mugs gathering dust, and a yellow tie that screams, ‘Fashion nightmare.’ Honestly, I wouldn’t wear it even if it paid rent.”
Then there’s Sirajis, a 35-year-old professor, who spoke for an entire demographic of overworked, under-rested men. “Honestly, I’d love someone to pay my electricity bill for a month. That would be a real gift.”
Now, that might sound absurd at first. A bill! As a present? But in a world where adulthood feels like a recurring tax, it’s actually poetic. Nothing says love like financial relief.
Others, however, were more direct about their preferences. “Rather than giving me the wrong gift,” said Imran, a marketing executive, “just give me money. I’ll buy what I want. Saves both of us disappointment.”
Fair point. Sentiment is nice, but practicality pays Imran’s rent.
However, Hasan, a writer and journalist, shared a story that perfectly captures the quiet fatigue of modern manhood. “Once, my wife took me Eid shopping to buy me gifts because me not getting gifts makes her sad. After making me walk the whole market, she bought me a few things that she thinks I should love. And, honestly, letting me stay at home and relax for an evening would have been my gift.”
You can almost hear every husband in the country nodding in solidarity.
Then there’s Imtiaz, who spoke from a gentler, more introspective place. “Being the breadwinner, I often like things here and there, maybe online or at a shop, but I don’t buy them because I try to be responsible. But if someone close to me notices that and buys me that one thing, that would be my kind of gift. I’d love that.”
That might be the truest expression of what men actually want: to be noticed. Not the showy kind of attention, but the quiet understanding that someone sees their small desires, the ones they silently sacrifice for responsibility.
And finally, perhaps the most honest take came from Farhan, who grinned as he said, “If my wife really wants to gift me something I’d absolutely love, it would be a boys’ trip with my school friends. Because with the boys, it’s cheaper, less responsibility, and more fun.”
No ties, no perfumes, no shopping — just a weekend of laughter and irresponsibility. The dream!
What’s interesting, though, is that not all men fit the stereotype of being emotionally indifferent to gifts. Some genuinely enjoy receiving them — even flowers.
“I once got flowers from a friend on my birthday,” shared Ratul, a university student. “I didn’t expect it, but it felt nice. Men, often, don’t say it much, but we like being thought of too.”
And there lies the quiet truth behind the jokes — men aren’t “bad at gifts” or “don’t care about them.” They’ve just been taught to act like they don’t. Society’s script has long told men to provide, not to receive. To buy gifts, not to deserve them.
From mugs to money to mental peace, one thing becomes clear: men don’t crave things as much as they crave thought. A gift that says, “I see you, I know what you like, and you don’t have to worry or pretend.”
It’s not that they don’t like surprises. They just prefer the kind that makes their lives easier. A thoughtful book. A gadget they’ve been eyeing. A meal they didn’t have to pay for.  Because in the end, the best gifts for men aren’t wrapped in paper. They’re wrapped in understanding, practicality, and occasionally, the promise of a quiet evening with a plate of tahiri.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1963706,Privatisation push - Dawn,"ONE swallow does not make a summer. Does it? Thesaleof PIA has fetched the government much praise — if not much cash. Simultaneously, it has stirred hopes that the first major privatisation in more than two decades would pave the way for the disinvestment of the other white elephants, sooner than later.
Many expect the transaction to help revive investor confidence, with foreign private parties potentially lining up to invest in the country or acquire other loss-making state assets on the chopping block. Indeed, PIA’s sale makes a strong case for the government to forge ahead with its privatisationagenda, while taking advantage of the feel-good sentiment this transaction has sparked.
For Pakistan, privatisation of state-owned enterprises no longer signifies an ideological choice but an economic necessity. Most SOEs, like the national flag carrier, are a heavy burden on the budget with their combined losses running into hundreds of billions of rupees every year at the taxpayers’ expense. Needless to say these losses are squeezing funds that could be used to build hospitals and schools, distorting markets and undermining public services delivery.
While it is critical to sustain this momentum if the government is to durably stabilise its budget and create some fiscal space for development, this will not happen automatically. Nor will the PIA sale help restore investor interest any time soon. The process of privatisation is going to be long and demands painful structural reforms to actually boost business sentiment in the country.
In recent years we have seen dozens of foreign companiesexitthe Pakistan market due to tough economic conditions, exchange rate volatility, difficulties in profit repatriation, policy unpredictability, poor regulatory environment, heavy tax burden, and delays in settlement of commercial disputes. On top of that, high energy costs and disruptions in supply chains due to foreign exchange restrictions have further eroded competitiveness and business confidence in recent years.
Local investors too are not very bullish on fresh investment, at least not for the moment. The absence of foreign investors from the PIA auction shows reluctance on their part to become part of Pakistan’s economy in any way. Even local investors, who won the bid, had to rope in Fauji Fertiliser for institutional protection to hedge against any future policy reversals or adverse actions.
If privatisation is to succeed, the government must move decisively on multiple fronts: strengthen regulators for effective governance, guarantee policy continuity, broaden tax base, alleviate burden on compliant businesses, ensure rule of law for quicker settlement of commercial disputes, reduce cost of doing business etc. Without these structural reforms, individual transactions like PIA may succeed once in a while, but the broader privatisation agenda will continue to stall.
Perhaps, this is the time for the government to seize the opportunity to undertake structural reforms that have long prevented Pakistan from attracting direct foreign private investment.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1959819,Give the revenue a break - Dawn,"Pakistan’s taxation policies are increasingly proving counterproductive, constraining investment and suppressing growth. Key stakeholders now hope the International Monetary Fund (IMF) willrecognisethe centrality of economic expansion to durable stabilisation and ease pressure on the government, allowing it fiscal space to recalibrate its tax policy.
They contend that only such flexibility can unshackle the country’s economic potential and unlock its vast productive capacity.
Under the IMF oversight and a strict focus on fiscal stabilisation, Pakistan’s tax collection has risen sharply over the past two years.
According to the State Bank, tax revenuegrewby a notable 12.5 per cent year-on-year in Q1FY26. However, despite repeated claims of broadening the tax base, tangible progress remains elusive.
‘Out of the proposed Rs975bn package, the bulk of the relief may go to companies, with super tax potentially cut from 10pc to 5pc’
Large sectors, including agriculture, wholesale, retail trade, real estate, and high-earning service providers such as lawyers, doctors, architects, artists, consultants, etc, continue to operate largely outside the tax net. As a result, the burden of additional revenue mobilisation has fallen disproportionately on those already within the tax system.
This pattern is also reflected in official publications. According to the ‘21st Edition of the Revenue Division Year Book 2025’, the share of direct taxes in total taxes rose from 37.2pc in FY22 to 49.3pc in FY25. A review of the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 and related publications confirms that the government does not regularly publish a clean breakdown of the share of categories of direct taxpayers, such as corporations or salaried individuals, in total direct tax collection.
However, the corporate sector is understood to account for around 65pc of direct tax collections. The salaried individuals, presumed to be captive taxpayers, whose taxes are deducted at source and who constitute less than 8pc of the labour force, are believed to be contributing far more than their proportional share to the tax take.
Acknowledging that Pakistan’s unusually high tax burden has become a drag on growth, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif reportedly directed his economic team last week to engage the IMF on a proposed Rs975 billion tax-relief package as a part of a strategy to spur job creation and capital formation.
‘High taxation is the single biggest obstacle to investment, and we are hoping the IMF will approve the relief package’
The package was crafted by one of the government’s working groups, which included representatives from civil society and the private sector, to recommend tax structure reforms. The private-sector-led group on taxation, chaired by Shahzad Saleem, proposed phasing the relief over three years, with an estimated immediate cost of Rs600bn. The government, however, opted to seek the IMF’s endorsement before proceeding with implementation.
Senior members of the economic team were approached for comment, but no response was received by the time of filing. However, a source familiar with the deliberations said the prime minister’s close advisors broadly support the tax panel’s proposals, viewing them as critical for kick-starting growth.
“High taxation is the single biggest obstacle to investment, and we are hoping the IMF will approve the relief package,” a senior official noted privately. “We have some fiscal space, with the fiscal deficit down from over 8pc to around 5pc, but we need the Fund’s relaxation on the primary-surplus target to move ahead.”
Responding to a question on how much of the proposed relief targets the salaried class, former FBR chairman Shabbar Zaidi noted, “The maximum salary tax rate is proposed to be reduced by five percentage points. The impact will be no more than Rs30–40bn. So, out of a Rs975bn package, the bulk of the relief would go to companies. Super Tax is to be cut from 10pc to 5pc.” He pointed out that the proposal contains no concrete measures to offset the resulting revenue shortfall.
Business leaders serving on government working groups declined to comment under their engagement terms. However, former Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik endorsed the proposed tax relief, arguing that Pakistan’s tax regime renders businesses uncompetitive and punishes the most tax-compliant. “Salaried employees and formal-sector firms bear a crushing tax burden while large segments of the economy remain untaxed.”
He warned that the high-tax approach under the 24th IMF programme is stifling investment, destroying jobs and accelerating skilled emigration, while repeated pledges to tax retailers, wholesalers, transporters, doctors, lawyers and salon operators have produced little progress.
“In this context, tax cuts are not just desirable but essential. Proposed measures include lowering the corporate tax rate from 29pc to 25pc; bringing maximum individual and AOP rates down from 38–49pc to a rational 25pc; abolishing the super tax; removing taxes on inter-corporate dividends; cutting sales tax from 18pc to 15pc; and withdrawing the Capital Value Tax. The real challenge, as always, will be closing the fiscal gap and securing IMF approval,” Mr Malik remarked.
“That requires political will. The government must cut expenditure, fast-track privatisation, and phase in tax reductions over three years. Evidence shows that lower, predictable taxes stimulate investment, create jobs, and ultimately raise revenue. Pakistan cannot grow while choking its most productive sectors.
“Above all, personal income tax rates need an immediate cut. Salaried workers have become the easiest target, taxed far beyond economic reality. Easing this burden is vital to restore confidence, stem the brain drain, and put the country on a sustainable growth path,” he concluded.
Abdul Aleem, Secretary General, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, supported a calibrated reduction in tax rates for both the corporate and salaried groups. He noted that publicly available details do not explain how the Rs975bn figure was derived or what share is intended for salaried taxpayers.
He believed that the IMF is broadly aligned with the proposed relief but urged the Ministry of Finance to clarify how the resulting revenue shortfall would be addressed.
