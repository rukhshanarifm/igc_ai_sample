      "fullText": "Weak performance by Pakistan\u2019s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country\u2019s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.\nThe report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with \u201crigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)\u201d to reduce tariffs were a milestone.\nHowever, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.\n\u201cOverall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,\u201d the report read.\nRead more:ECC approves Rs659.65bn govt guarantee for circular debt financing\nThe regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the \u201cold era of scarcity is ending\u201d, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might \u201cprove to be even more complex\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.\nIn its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.\nMeanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the \u2018Take or Pay\u2019 electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.\nNEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.\n\u201cA significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan\u2019s power system.\u201d\nThe regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.\n\u201cIt remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.\u201d\nOn the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.\nRead more:Circular debt rose Rs79bn on \u2018seasonable, operational factors\u2019: Power Division\nAt the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.\n\u201cGovernance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan\u2019s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,\u201d the NEPRA report said.\nKE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.\nIn contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.\nQESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.\nIn terms of recovery, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) was the best-placed DISCO with a recovery rate of 101.7%, followed by GEPCO and LESCO.",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: Despite lofty assurances, reform roadmaps and repeated declarations of intent, the government\u2019s narrative on fixing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) rings hollow when confronted with unforgiving fiscal reality.\nIn the first full fiscal year of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s government, SOEs slid deeper into financial distress, with their cumulative net losses surging by nearly 300 percent, soaring from Rs30.6 billion in FY2023-24 to a massive Rs122.9 billion in FY2024-25. These numbers, presented by the finance ministry at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises last week, expose a widening gap between promise and performance.A closer reading of the data deepens this disquiet. The combined revenues of SOEs fell over 10 percent to Rs12.4 trillion in FY2024-25, while even among profitable enterprises, earnings lost momentum, with aggregate profits sliding 13 percent from the previous year to end at Rs710 billion.\nREAD MORE:ADB approves $540mn financing to advance SOE reforms, coastal resilience in Pakistan\nLoss-making SOEs offered little comfort, with their combined losses easing by a negligible two percent, a change too small to signal any meaningful turnaround. Worse still, SOEs also drew a massive Rs2.1 trillion in annual fiscal support, underscoring how public resources continue to be funneled into chronic inefficiency rather than productive growth. These fiscal flows were driven largely by higher equity injections to address the circular debt build-up, making it patently clear that public funds are being used to manage distress, and not to resolve the structural failures that continue to drag SOEs and the wider economy down.\nWhile the finance ministry attributes the decline in SOE revenues primarily to falling international oil prices, which compressed margins in the oil sector, this factor can only explain a small part of the slowdown, and cannot account for the sheer magnitude of the losses now weighing on the public balance sheet. These losses, it must be noted, are not broadly spread but heavily concentrated in a small cluster of entities, most notably the National Highway Authority and several power distribution companies (DISCOs). This is hardly a new development. These entities have long been mired in inefficiency and chronic red ink, underscoring that the losses in FY2024-25 reflect deep-seated structural failures rather than temporary market fluctuations. Nowhere is this more evident than in DISCOs, which have come to embody the power sector\u2019s systemic decay: a crumbling transmission and distribution (T&D) network haemorrhaging revenue through electricity theft, excessive line losses and chronic mis-governance. High depreciation and financing costs compound the problem, as an ageing T&D infrastructure inflates balance sheets without generating commensurate revenue, while repeated borrowing to bridge cash shortfalls and service circular debt accumulates interest expenses, locking these entities into a self-perpetuating cycle of financial stress.\nEven when it comes to profit-making SOEs, the system\u2019s limits are apparent, as their returns often rely on guaranteed government contracts, leaving open the question of whether they could survive under genuine open market competition. The need for a bold, wide-ranging reform agenda for SOEs, then, remains urgent, yet progress on the ground has been painfully slow.\nEfforts so far have been piecemeal, lacking coherence, and often driven more by pressure from international lenders than by a genuine commitment to restructuring loss-making entities. Meaningful change would require comprehensive sectoral reorganisation, greater deregulation to foster competition and the establishment of robust corporate governance frameworks to tackle inefficiencies, while strengthening transparency and accountability.\nWhat we\u2019ve had on our hands instead is political inertia and bureaucratic resistance. This has meant that for an administration that has repeatedly promised sweeping SOE reform, plans remain largely on paper, execution is patchy at best and the cost of delay keeps mounting.\nThe government must recognise that without decisive action on SOE governance, accountability and privatisation, the reform narrative will remain meaningless while the financial haemorrhage continues unabated.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: An assessment of Pakistan\u2019s power sector during FY 2024-25 prompted National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to observe that despite several structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remains limited and insufficient to inspire confidence in the sector\u2019s ability to support sustained industrial growth or provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential segments.\nIn its State of the Industry Report 2024-25, NEPRA stated that the power sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain efficiency and undermine its contribution to economic development.\nThe regulator emphasized that power sector entities must operate under commercially binding agreements that clearly define roles, performance standards, and accountability mechanisms.\nREAD MORE:NEPRA could come under Power Division\u2019s control, as per govt\u2019s latest amendments\nEach entity should bear the financial consequences of its inefficiencies rather than passing these costs on to consumers, who are currently burdened with approximately Rs233 billion in Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)\u2014a cost arising not from normal business operations but from inefficiencies within certain sector entities.\nAccording to the report, generation capacity under \u201cTake or Pay\u201d contracts remains significantly underutilized, resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants. Simultaneously, the transmission network is both constrained and underutilized, contributing to higher transmission tariffs and preventing the dispatch of cheaper and more efficient electricity in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).\nOn the distribution side, several government-owned DISCOs continue to suffer from poor governance, with transmission and distribution (T&D) losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery, and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. These inefficiencies further exacerbate asset underutilisation across generation, transmission, and distribution, while fueling the circular debt problem.\nNepra noted that challenges faced by power sector entities\u2014largely government-owned\u2014span planning, execution, and operational domains.\nPersistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered financial sustainability and limited the sector\u2019s contribution to economic growth. Weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management further constrain the sector\u2019s ability to provide reliable and affordable electricity.\nDuring FY 2024-25, efforts were made to reduce \u201cTake or Pay\u201d generation capacity through the retirement or decommissioning of inefficient power plants with consistently low utilisation. As a result, 2,829 MW of capacity was retired, decommissioned, or had its Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) terminated.\nConsequently, effective operational generation capacity declined to 41,121 MW as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888 MW a year earlier. However, 884 MW of new hydropower capacity\u2014Suki Kinari Hydropower Project\u2014was added during the year.\nThe utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the CPPA-G system remained 38.82%. NEPRA highlighted that generation costs account for nearly 82% of the electricity tariff. During FY 2024-25, the actual per-unit Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) stood at Rs14.21/kWh, the highest component of the electricity tariff, primarily due to underutilisation of \u201cTake or Pay\u201d plants.\nDuring the year, several power plants approached NEPRA through CPPA-G seeking reductions in generation tariffs. Approval of these adjustments is expected to yield long-term benefits by lowering generation costs, improving tariff efficiency, and stabilizing consumer prices, while also supporting investor confidence through a predictable regulatory environment.\nHowever, NEPRA noted that persistent inefficiencies in public sector power plants \u2014 such as the 747 MW Guddu Power Plant, 969 MW Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, and several WAPDA-operated hydro plants\u2014are undermining tariff reduction efforts. These inefficiencies result in lower utilisation, higher costs, and reduced system efficiency, offsetting gains from IPP tariff reductions and plant retirements.\nThe Part Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) added Rs46.388 billion to generation costs in FY 2024-25, compared to Rs55.671 billion in 2023-24, and, while unavoidable, these costs can be significantly reduced through effective demand-side management.\nSimilarly, Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) costs declined to Rs13.285 billion, from Rs39.521 billion, though NEPRA said further reductions are possible through better grid management.\nLower utilisation of Thar coal-based power plants, which operated at 67.23% utilisation, also raised generation costs by inflating both CPP and Energy Purchase Price (EPP). Delays in ensuring regular coal supply to Lucky Electric Power Company further exacerbated inefficiencies.\nNepra observed widespread underutilisation of transmission assets, including the 4,000 MW Matiari\u2013Lahore HVDC line, which operated at just 35% utilisation despite payments based on full availability. Manual system logs further hinder accurate assessment of transmission performance.\nThe poor performance of the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) has led to violations of the economic merit order, increased generation costs, project delays, and cost overruns. Delays in key projects\u2014including KE-NGC interconnection, Lahore North Grid, and SCADA-III\u2014have adversely affected system reliability and finances.\nGovernance remains the most critical issue confronting DISCOs. KE, PESCO, HESCO, SEPCO, and QESCO were identified as the poorest performers, with excessive losses, low recovery, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Except for TESCO, no DISCO met Nepra-approved T&D loss targets.\nWeak DISCO performance contributed approximately Rs397 billion to circular debt during the year. Nepra termed load-shedding based on AT&C losses unlawful and inequitable, as it penalizes compliant consumers and deepens sector inefficiencies.\nRising electricity costs and poor service have pushed consumers\u2014particularly affluent ones\u2014towards rooftop solar PV systems and battery storage, reducing grid demand during non-solar hours.\nNepra also expressed concern over the underperformance of the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO), citing limited adoption of modern technologies and the absence of a fully functional SCADA system.\nThe regulator concluded that Pakistan\u2019s power sector transformation remains incomplete without full implementation of the 1992 WAPDA Restructuring Plan, emphasizing corporatization, decentralization, privatization, and separation of policy, regulation, and operations. Continued centralized control, overlapping mandates, and weak accountability, it warned, will perpetuate inefficiencies and impose unnecessary financial burdens on the economy.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: While acknowledging that K-Electric has no role in the accumulation of circular debt, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has noted that KE consumers are nonetheless paying a Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per kWh, highlighting the inequitable burden of sector inefficiencies on electricity users.\nNepra stated that despite determining consumer-end tariffs in a manner that fully covers the revenue requirements of all entities across the power supply chain, persistent structural inefficiencies and the historical poor performance of distribution companies (Discos) leave little reason to expect that circular debt can be sustainably controlled.\nThe regulator explained that if NEPRA-determined tariffs were fully implemented and all sector entities met prescribed performance targets, each entity\u2019s financial obligations would be met and circular debt would not arise.\nREAD MORE:Govt wants to alter KE consumer-end tariff as per Nepra fixation\nHowever, in practice, several power sector entities fail to achieve these targets due to weak governance, poor recovery performance, and high technical and commercial losses, resulting in insufficient revenue collection and the continued accumulation of circular debt.\nAs of June 30, 2025, circular debt in Pakistan\u2019s power sector stood at approximately Rs1.614 trillion, compared to Rs2.393 trillion a year earlier, reflecting a reduction of around Rs780 billion. Nepra noted, however, that this decline does not represent a structural improvement and mirrors similar short-term reductions seen in the past.\nAccording to Nepra, both current and previous declines in circular debt primarily resulted from external financial injections rather than from meaningful sector reforms. During FY 2024-25, DISCO inefficiencies contributed approximately Rs265 billion through excessive T&D losses and Rs132 billion due to low recovery ratios. Despite these shortcomings, the overall circular debt figure declined during the year.\nNepra attributed this reduction to the Government of Pakistan securing commercial financing to retire liabilities of Power Holding (Private) Limited (PHPL) and clear arrears owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). While this intervention temporarily lowered circular debt, it failed to address the sector\u2019s underlying inefficiencies.\nTo service the cost of this borrowing, most electricity consumers \u2014 excluding a few protected domestic categories\u2014are now required to pay an additional Rs3.23 per kWh under the Debt Servicing Surcharge for several years. Nepra noted that this surcharge effectively transfers the burden of sector inefficiencies to consumers and represents one of the largest components of the end-user tariff, after the Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) and Energy Purchase Price (EPP).\nNepra further stated that KE, the country\u2019s only private-sector distribution company, does not contribute to circular debt, as it absorbs the financial impact of higher losses and lower recoveries instead of passing these costs on to consumers. Despite this, KE consumers remain subject to the DSS. To date, KE has collected and remitted Rs35.76 billion under the DSS to the Government of Pakistan and CPPA-G.\nThe regulator observed that had public-sector Discos been privatized in line with the 1992 power sector reform strategy, trillions of rupees in losses could have been avoided, and consumers would have benefited from improved service quality. Nepra added that although challenges to privatization persist even after more than two decades, these hurdles can be overcome through well-designed strategies and firm political commitment.\nGiven the prevailing structural inefficiencies and the historical performance of Discos, Nepra concluded that there is little justification to expect sustainable control of circular debt or lasting improvements in the power sector under the existing framework.\nREAD MORE:Consumers of KE, others: Govt to pass on Rs53.4bn relief under QTA for Q4\u201925\nNepra data shows that KE has recorded a sustained decline in transmission and distribution losses since its privatization in 2005, when losses were reported at around 40 percent. By FY 2024-25, KE\u2019s losses had fallen to below 15 percent, a level that remains above ideal benchmarks but is significantly lower than those observed across several public-sector Discos. The regulator attributed this long-term reduction to improved governance mechanisms and greater operational accountability following privatization.\nIn its assessment of recovery performance, Nepra observed that KE absorbed the impact of recovery shortfalls internally rather than transferring the burden to the power supply chain. While KE consumers continued to pay the federally imposed Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS), under which Rs. 35.76 billion was collected during the year, the utility itself did not add to sector-wide payment arrears, distinguishing its financial treatment from that of government-owned Discos.\nReferring to broader sector reforms, Nepra noted that KE\u2019s post-privatization experience illustrates the potential benefits of reduced government control, including greater financial discipline and operational responsiveness. However, the regulator cautioned that KE\u2019s performance should be viewed as part of a wider reform discussion rather than an isolated solution, emphasising that comprehensive structural changes across all distribution companies would be required to achieve sustainable sector-wide improvement.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

Sources said the top leadership of the Power Division has long been at odds with the power sector regulator on multiple issues, with some officials openly criticising NEPRA members for \u201cbehaving like judges.\u201d\nThe Power minister has also reportedly expressed displeasure over several of the Authority\u2019s decisions. Under the proposed amendments to the Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997, references to the \u201cFederal Government\u201d are to be replaced with the \u201cappropriate authority.\u201d\nREAD MORE:Nepra working on \u2018single system operator\u2019 framework\nSection 3(a) empowers the Authority to determine tariffs, rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services by generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and to recommend these to the relevant division for notification.\nUnder the revised Section 31(7), notification of NEPRA-approved tariffs or uniform tariffs\u2014along with rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services\u2014shall be made in the official Gazette by the division concerned within 30 days of intimation by the Authority. If the division fails to notify the tariff or refer the matter back to NEPRA for reconsideration within the specified time, the Authority may direct immediate application of its approved tariff through notification, subject to any subsequent adjustments arising from reconsideration requested by the division.\nSection 31(7)(i) provides that the division concerned may, within 30 days of receiving NEPRA\u2019s intimation regarding approved tariffs of public-sector distribution and supply licensees, require the Authority to reconsider its determination on issues common to these licensees. NEPRA would then be required to complete the reconsideration within 30 days and inform the division accordingly.\nUnder Section 31(7)(ii), NEPRA may make quarterly tariff adjustments within 15 days on account of capacity and transmission charges, transmission and distribution losses, variable operation and maintenance costs, and policy guidelines issued by the division concerned. The adjusted tariff would be intimated to the division prior to Gazette notification. The division may seek reconsideration within 15 days, failing which NEPRA shall notify the adjusted tariff in the official Gazette. If reconsideration is sought, NEPRA must decide the matter within 15 days and intimate the division before notification.\nSection 31(7)(iii) allows the division concerned, in lieu of seeking reconsideration, to file an appeal.\nREAD MORE:NEPRA could come under Power Division\u2019s control, as per govt\u2019s latest amendments\nHowever, once a reconsideration request is filed, the division will not be entitled to subsequently appeal the decision on that reconsideration. No changes have been proposed to Section 31(7)(iv).\nSimilarly, amendments have been proposed to the Electricity Act, 1910, replacing the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cappropriate authority\u201d or \u201cDivision concerned.\u201d\nUnder the revised Section 32(2), any dispute between an operator and the telegraph authority regarding the placement or operation of electric supply lines shall be referred to the division concerned, which may direct the operator to make necessary alterations to comply with the law. Amendments to Section 53(1)(a) relate to the service of notices, orders, or documents, stipulating that where the addressee is the Federal or Provincial Government, such service shall be made at the office designated by the division concerned.\nCommenting on the proposed amendments, a power sector expert said the move appears aimed at making NEPRA a subordinate entity of the Power Division, which would significantly undermine the regulator\u2019s ability to make independent tariff determinations.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

These determinations were forwarded to the Federal Government for filing a uniform tariff application in accordance with the NEPRA Act. Section 31(4) of the Act requires NEPRA, on the basis of a uniform tariff application, to determine a uniform tariff for public-sector licensees engaged in power supply, in the consumer\u2019s interest, based on consolidated accounts.\nSubsequently, the Power Division filed a motion for determination of the uniform tariff based on the consolidated revenue requirement of DISCOs. In line with the National Electricity Policy, the uniform tariff will also apply to K-Electric (KE) consumers.\nAccordingly, NEPRA was requested to issue a revised Schedule of Tariff (SoT) for KE consumers, to be notified from January 1, 2026.\nThe hearing officiated by Chairman NEPRA, Waseem Mukhtar (Zoom, Member (Development) Maqsood Anwar Khan (Zoom) and Member (Law) Amina Ahmed.\nA Power Division team, led by Additional Secretary (Power Finance) Mehfooz Bhatti and Naveed Qaiser, gave a comprehensive presentation covering power-sector issues related to tariffs, revenue requirements, future generation forecasts, and the impact of solarisation, including net metering and off-grid solutions.\nIndustry representatives disclosed that recent consultations with the government revealed cross-subsidies of Rs131 billion within DISCOs, while total cross-subsidies in KE\u2019s jurisdiction amount to approximately Rs160 billion. This means industrial consumers are effectively paying up to Rs7 per kWh in cross-subsidy.\nReferring to the textile spinning sector, participants highlighted that the number of spindles in Pakistan has fallen from 10.25 million to nearly half. In contrast, China has installed more than 35 million spindles in Xinjiang province\u2014its poorest region\u2014and is adding another 15 million spindles.\nThe Chinese government provides electricity at around 5 cents per kWh, enabling rapid industrial expansion and job creation. Electricity tariffs in other parts of China range between 7 to 8 cents per kWh.\nIn comparison, Pakistan\u2019s industrial electricity tariff stands at 12.9 cents per kWh, making exports uncompetitive. Chinese textile products, including yarn and fabric, are already flooding Pakistani markets.\n\u201cIf the industry is relieved of cross-subsidy, the tariff would be around 9 cents per kWh, which could make exports viable. However, this option is being denied solely due to cross-subsidy,\u201d a representative said.\nIndustry leaders noted that domestic consumers have reduced their monthly electricity consumption to below 200 units to remain eligible for subsidies by installing small solar plants.\nAamir Sheikh stated that neither industry nor exports can survive under current tariffs, adding that the cross-subsidy mechanism must be eliminated entirely. \u201cThe solution to Pakistan\u2019s economic problems lies in industrial job creation, not in forcing industry to subsidise the domestic sector,\u201d he said.\nIndustry representatives also pointed out that industrial consumers pay an additional Rs3.23 per unit as Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)\u2014another form of cross-subsidy\u2014despite having no role in the creation of circular debt. They noted that 10,000 people enter the job market daily, requiring the same number of new jobs to prevent social instability.\n\u201cIndustry pays around Rs35 per kWh against an actual cost of Rs29 per kWh, with full bill recovery and negligible line losses.

Aligning tariffs for large-scale manufacturing with regional benchmarks of around 9 cents per kWh would restore competitiveness, boost exports, attract investment, and create jobs. Increased electricity demand would also improve capacity utilization, reduce per-unit costs, and lower tariffs across all consumer categories.\nRehan Javed proposed several recommendations: (i) transparent disclosure of cross-subsidies embedded in industrial tariffs; (ii) a time-bound plan for eliminating industrial cross-subsidies; (iii) provision of any remaining support through explicit, targeted budget subsidies instead of embedded tariffs; and (iv) ensuring that industrial off-peak consumption is not treated as the primary subsidy pool.\nHe also urged NEPRA to apply voltage-wise allowed loss factors, differentiate distribution margins by voltage, and notify a defined high-voltage cost-of-service adjustment for B-category consumers.\nResponding to industry concerns, Naveed Qaiser said the government remains in continuous consultation with stakeholders to reduce industrial tariffs. He noted that industrial cross-subsidies have been reduced from Rs225 billion to Rs102 billion, equivalent to a reduction of Rs5.13 per kWh.\nOverall industrial tariffs have fallen from Rs62.33 per kWh in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per kWh, a reduction of Rs16.68 per kWh (26 per cent).\nThe Power Division informed the Authority that Pakistan\u2019s current installed power generation capacity stands at 58,013 MW, including 9,590 MW from government-owned power plants, 2,007 MW from hydel IPPs, 11,547 MW from thermal IPPs, and 2,795 MW from renewable IPPs.\nPower available on the National Grid Company system is 36,397 MW, while KE\u2019s generation capacity is 2,647 MW.

This has created a financial burden of approximately Rs3.5 per kWh on DISCO consumers who continue to pay electricity bills.\nFor FY 2026, 116.40 billion units were received, while 113.58 billion units are expected in CY 2026. Electricity sales stood at 103.56 billion units in FY 2026 and are projected at 101.23 billion units in CY 2026.

      "fullText": "The IMF Second Review Staff Mission Report contains a set of positive macroeconomic projections of Pakistan from 2025-26 to 2029-30. These five-year projections are considered as feasible and achievable with the appropriate set of policies and reforms.\nThe objective of this article is to describe the key aspects of these projections and their likelihood, given the outlook over the five years.\nThe projections postulate the achievement simultaneously of growth and stability as follows:\n(i) The GDP growth rate is expected to accelerate at a moderate pace from 2.7 percent in 2024-25 to 3.2 percent in 2025-26, 4.1 percent in 2026-27, 4.5 percent in 2027-28, and stay thereafter at 4.5 percent. It is surprising, however, that the IMF does not expect a growth rate of 5 percent by the fifth year.\n(ii) Despite the significantly rising GDP growth rate, the rate of inflation is expected to remain moderate and single-digit. It is projected to rise from only 4.5 percent in 2024-25 to 6.3 percent in 2025-26 and to 7 percent in 2026-27. Thereafter, it is expected to remain constant at 6.5 percent. Therefore, the \u2018Philip\u2019s Curve\u2019 will not operate in Pakistan, whereby higher GDP growth rate is accompanied by demand-pull pressures which lead to more inflation.\n(iii) Pakistan external vulnerability will simultaneously be reduced substantially. The current account deficit in the balance of payments will remain below or at 1 percent of the GDP over the next five years. It will rise somewhat from a deficit of 0.6 percent of the GDP in 2025-26 to 1.0 percent of the GDP in 2029-30.\nThere will be increasing net inflows into the financial account of the balance of payments, from USD 2.5 billion in 2024-25, to USD 3.8 billion in 2025-26, to USD 5.9 billion in by 2026-27 and approach USD 10 billion by 2029-30.\nThe result is likely to be exponential growth in foreign exchange reserves. From USD 14.5 billion in 2024-25, they are projected to rise to USD 17.8 billion in 2025-26 and to USD 23.3 billion in 2026-27. Therefore, Pakistan will have attained the safe reserves cover of over three months by the end of the present IMF programme. As such, there will be no need to go into another Programme.\nThe task is to determine the combination of exogenous factors, policies and reforms, which will remove the trade-off between stabilization and growth. As highlighted above, over the next five years IMF expects to see acceleration in GDP growth, continuation of moderate inflation and strengthening of Pakistan\u2019s external position, with relatively high foreign exchange reserves.\nThe global environment is characterized by the terms of trade that Pakistan is likely to face in coming years. From a worsening by 10.5 percent in 2024-25, they are projected by the IMF to improve by 2.7 percent in 2025-26 and by 1.7 percent in 2026-27. Thereafter, they are likely to remain, more or less, unchanged for Pakistan. Also, remittances are projected to increase by USD 5 billion by 2029-30, above the higher level of USD 38 billion attained in 2024-25. These trends will facilitate control over the size of the current account deficit.\nThe rising level of fixed investment projected by the IMF is based on the assumption; first, that there will continue to be political stability in Pakistan. Second, that the country will face no major natural disasters, like the floods of 2022-23 and 2024-25. Third, there will no escalation in conflicts across the borders and terrorism will be brought increasingly under control. Consequently, the level of fixed investment is expected to rise significantly from 12 percent to 14 percent of the GDP in five years.\nThe macroeconomic projections have also to be achieved on basis of the magnitudes chosen of the policy variables impacting on growth and stabilization. The IMF has indicated the following:\n(i) The rupee is expected to depreciate by 5.9 percent in 2025-26, 6.3 percent in 2026-27, 4.5 percent annually from 2027-28 to 2029-30.\n(ii) The nominal policy rate is expected to fall by 1 percent point in 2025-26 and 2026-27. Thereafter, the fall is expected annually of 0.5 percent point.\n(iii) The overall tax-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase from 12.3 percent in 2024-25 to 13.3 percent of the GDP and to 13.7 percent of the GDP in 2026-27. Thereafter, it is expected to remain constant at 13.9 percent of the GDP.\n(iv) Perhaps surprisingly, the level of development spending is expected to remain constant at close to 2.5 percent of the GDP. It appears that IMF does not indicate the need for a larger and faster expansion of infrastructure to facilitate the process of growth.\nWhat are the consequences of a favorable external environment of global trade and domestic stability, along with the intensity and range of policies described above?\nWe first look at the impact on the public finances. The overall budget deficit is expected to be curtailed substantially over the next five years, from 5.4 percent of the GDP n 2024-25 to only 2.8 percent of the GDP by 2029-30. Bulk of this decline is anticipated from containment of expenditure, from 21.2 percent of the GDP in 2024-25 to 18.7 percent of the GDP in 2029-30.\nThe level of revenues is expected to remain, more or less, unchanged at close to 16 percent of the GDP. Tax revenues will increasingly substitute for non-tax revenues. The latter will fall from 3.5 percent to 2 percent of the GDP due especially to the big fall in SBP profits, with the fall in interest rates.\nSecond, the bottom line is the impact on the balance of payments. The sizes of the current account deficit and financial account surplus projected by the IMF have already been highlighted above. Within the current account, exports are expected to show an average growth rate of 7.1 percent over the five years, while imports are projected to increase at a somewhat slower growth rate of 6.7 percent. The liabilities under primary income outflows are anticipated to grow by a marginal 1.2 percent. However, there is the expectation of significant increase in remittances as highlighted above.\nThe projected financial account of the balance of payments contains an increase of as much as 28 percent annually, with the level rising from USD 2.4 billion in 2024-25 to almost USD 10 billion by 2029-30. This will be due primarily to a diversification of inflows. Net borrowings from multilaterals and governments will be lower due to higher level of amortization. Foreign direct investment will rise to USD 3 billion.\nThe big jump will be in inflows from private sources. They were negative USD 1.8 billion in 2024-25. Improved perceptions of Pakistan\u2019s external position are expected to lead to an increase in inflows from international commercial banks and by bond flotations to over USD 6 billion by 2029-30.\nOverall, the IMF medium-term projections of Pakistan\u2019s economy are positive in nature. Thanks are due to IMF for having confidence in the process of economic management in the country, such that by end of the present programme, Pakistan will emerge as an economy characterized by both growth and stabilisation.\nHowever, there is need to emphasize that many of the projections are very optimistic in nature, including, first, that Pakistan will achieve a significant degree of export-led growth and remittances will continue growing from the big jump in 2024-25. This is anticipated despite the likelihood that the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) index will be rising with limited nominal depreciation of the rupee. Already, the index stands at 105. It is not surprising that exports have fallen by 6.2 percent in the first five months of 2025-26.\nFurther, imports are likely to rise faster than projected by the IMF because of the overvalued exchange rate and significant fall in interest rates. This effect is already visible. Imports have gone up by 13.6 percent in the first five months of 2025-26 in the presence of nominal stability of the rupee. Overall, there is a big risk that the current account deficit could be significantly larger than the level projected by the IMF over the next few years.\nSecond, the IMF projections indicate that the Provincial governments will be successful in raising the tax-to-GDP ratio from 0.6 percent to 1.6 percent of the GDP in the next five years. The largest \u2018tax gap\u2019 at the provincial level is in the agricultural income tax. However, the powerful lobby of large farmers will continue to prevent substantially larger collections from this tax.\nThird, there is the expectation of a very large reduction of 3 percent of the GDP in the debt servicing burden, due to the fall in interest rates. The fall in interest rates it will also facilitate a rise in the level of gross fixed capital formation, mostly by the private sector, from under 12 percent of the GDP in 2024-25 to 14 percent of the GDP by 2029-30. However, this will hinge on the end in the investment slump in the industrial sector since 2022-23.\nFourth, contrary to the IMF projection that development spending can remain unchanged at 2.4 percent of the GDP over the next five years without creating infrastructure constraints to faster growth, there will be the need for raising especially the Federal PSDP significantly as a percentage of the GDP. This will be necessary to facilitate increase in water resources, improvement in the electricity transmission and distribution network and the expansion of the network of highways.\nOverall, Pakistan stands at a critical juncture. Up till now, efforts at stabilization of the economy have implied lower economic growth, and a rise in unemployment and poverty. The IMF expects Pakistan to be able to raise the GDP growth rate to 4.5 percent by 2027-28 after the end of the Programme and maintain a high level of foreign reserves equivalent to an import cover of over three months. We hope and pray that this happens.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nDr Hafiz A Pasha\nThe writer is Professor Emeritus at BNU and former Federal Minister",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: While acknowledging that K-Electric has no role in the accumulation of circular debt, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has noted that KE consumers are nonetheless paying a Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per kWh, highlighting the inequitable burden of sector inefficiencies on electricity users.\nNepra stated that despite determining consumer-end tariffs in a manner that fully covers the revenue requirements of all entities across the power supply chain, persistent structural inefficiencies and the historical poor performance of distribution companies (Discos) leave little reason to expect that circular debt can be sustainably controlled.\nThe regulator explained that if NEPRA-determined tariffs were fully implemented and all sector entities met prescribed performance targets, each entity\u2019s financial obligations would be met and circular debt would not arise.\nREAD MORE:Govt wants to alter KE consumer-end tariff as per Nepra fixation\nHowever, in practice, several power sector entities fail to achieve these targets due to weak governance, poor recovery performance, and high technical and commercial losses, resulting in insufficient revenue collection and the continued accumulation of circular debt.\nAs of June 30, 2025, circular debt in Pakistan\u2019s power sector stood at approximately Rs1.614 trillion, compared to Rs2.393 trillion a year earlier, reflecting a reduction of around Rs780 billion. Nepra noted, however, that this decline does not represent a structural improvement and mirrors similar short-term reductions seen in the past.\nAccording to Nepra, both current and previous declines in circular debt primarily resulted from external financial injections rather than from meaningful sector reforms. During FY 2024-25, DISCO inefficiencies contributed approximately Rs265 billion through excessive T&D losses and Rs132 billion due to low recovery ratios. Despite these shortcomings, the overall circular debt figure declined during the year.\nNepra attributed this reduction to the Government of Pakistan securing commercial financing to retire liabilities of Power Holding (Private) Limited (PHPL) and clear arrears owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). While this intervention temporarily lowered circular debt, it failed to address the sector\u2019s underlying inefficiencies.\nTo service the cost of this borrowing, most electricity consumers \u2014 excluding a few protected domestic categories\u2014are now required to pay an additional Rs3.23 per kWh under the Debt Servicing Surcharge for several years. Nepra noted that this surcharge effectively transfers the burden of sector inefficiencies to consumers and represents one of the largest components of the end-user tariff, after the Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) and Energy Purchase Price (EPP).\nNepra further stated that KE, the country\u2019s only private-sector distribution company, does not contribute to circular debt, as it absorbs the financial impact of higher losses and lower recoveries instead of passing these costs on to consumers. Despite this, KE consumers remain subject to the DSS. To date, KE has collected and remitted Rs35.76 billion under the DSS to the Government of Pakistan and CPPA-G.\nThe regulator observed that had public-sector Discos been privatized in line with the 1992 power sector reform strategy, trillions of rupees in losses could have been avoided, and consumers would have benefited from improved service quality. Nepra added that although challenges to privatization persist even after more than two decades, these hurdles can be overcome through well-designed strategies and firm political commitment.\nGiven the prevailing structural inefficiencies and the historical performance of Discos, Nepra concluded that there is little justification to expect sustainable control of circular debt or lasting improvements in the power sector under the existing framework.\nREAD MORE:Consumers of KE, others: Govt to pass on Rs53.4bn relief under QTA for Q4\u201925\nNepra data shows that KE has recorded a sustained decline in transmission and distribution losses since its privatization in 2005, when losses were reported at around 40 percent. By FY 2024-25, KE\u2019s losses had fallen to below 15 percent, a level that remains above ideal benchmarks but is significantly lower than those observed across several public-sector Discos. The regulator attributed this long-term reduction to improved governance mechanisms and greater operational accountability following privatization.\nIn its assessment of recovery performance, Nepra observed that KE absorbed the impact of recovery shortfalls internally rather than transferring the burden to the power supply chain. While KE consumers continued to pay the federally imposed Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS), under which Rs. 35.76 billion was collected during the year, the utility itself did not add to sector-wide payment arrears, distinguishing its financial treatment from that of government-owned Discos.\nReferring to broader sector reforms, Nepra noted that KE\u2019s post-privatization experience illustrates the potential benefits of reduced government control, including greater financial discipline and operational responsiveness. However, the regulator cautioned that KE\u2019s performance should be viewed as part of a wider reform discussion rather than an isolated solution, emphasising that comprehensive structural changes across all distribution companies would be required to achieve sustainable sector-wide improvement.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has approved uniform national average tariff for Discos and KE for CY26 despite serious concerns of industry and export sector.\nThe industrial sector on Monday strongly opposed a cross-subsidy of nearly Rs130 billion imposed on industrial and export-oriented consumers, warning that the burden has rendered industrial growth and exports unfeasible.\nIndustry representatives expressed these concerns during a public hearing on the Federal Government\u2019s motion for the determination of a uniform electricity tariff for the Current Year (CY) 2026, following recent tariff determinations by Nepra, which proposed a reduction of 61 paisa per kWh for CY 2026.\nREAD MORE:Nepra reduces national average tariff\nNEPRA determined the tariffs of distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26. These determinations were forwarded to the Federal Government for filing a uniform tariff application in accordance with the NEPRA Act. Section 31(4) of the Act requires NEPRA, on the basis of a uniform tariff application, to determine a uniform tariff for public-sector licensees engaged in power supply, in the consumer\u2019s interest, based on consolidated accounts.\nSubsequently, the Power Division filed a motion for determination of the uniform tariff based on the consolidated revenue requirement of DISCOs. In line with the National Electricity Policy, the uniform tariff will also apply to K-Electric (KE) consumers.\nAccordingly, NEPRA was requested to issue a revised Schedule of Tariff (SoT) for KE consumers, to be notified from January 1, 2026.\nThe hearing officiated by Chairman NEPRA, Waseem Mukhtar (Zoom, Member (Development) Maqsood Anwar Khan (Zoom) and Member (Law) Amina Ahmed.\nA Power Division team, led by Additional Secretary (Power Finance) Mehfooz Bhatti and Naveed Qaiser, gave a comprehensive presentation covering power-sector issues related to tariffs, revenue requirements, future generation forecasts, and the impact of solarisation, including net metering and off-grid solutions.\nIndustry representatives disclosed that recent consultations with the government revealed cross-subsidies of Rs131 billion within DISCOs, while total cross-subsidies in KE\u2019s jurisdiction amount to approximately Rs160 billion. This means industrial consumers are effectively paying up to Rs7 per kWh in cross-subsidy.\nReferring to the textile spinning sector, participants highlighted that the number of spindles in Pakistan has fallen from 10.25 million to nearly half. In contrast, China has installed more than 35 million spindles in Xinjiang province\u2014its poorest region\u2014and is adding another 15 million spindles.\nThe Chinese government provides electricity at around 5 cents per kWh, enabling rapid industrial expansion and job creation. Electricity tariffs in other parts of China range between 7 to 8 cents per kWh.\nIn comparison, Pakistan\u2019s industrial electricity tariff stands at 12.9 cents per kWh, making exports uncompetitive. Chinese textile products, including yarn and fabric, are already flooding Pakistani markets.\n\u201cIf the industry is relieved of cross-subsidy, the tariff would be around 9 cents per kWh, which could make exports viable. However, this option is being denied solely due to cross-subsidy,\u201d a representative said.\nIndustry leaders noted that domestic consumers have reduced their monthly electricity consumption to below 200 units to remain eligible for subsidies by installing small solar plants.\nAamir Sheikh stated that neither industry nor exports can survive under current tariffs, adding that the cross-subsidy mechanism must be eliminated entirely. \u201cThe solution to Pakistan\u2019s economic problems lies in industrial job creation, not in forcing industry to subsidise the domestic sector,\u201d he said.\nIndustry representatives also pointed out that industrial consumers pay an additional Rs3.23 per unit as Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)\u2014another form of cross-subsidy\u2014despite having no role in the creation of circular debt. They noted that 10,000 people enter the job market daily, requiring the same number of new jobs to prevent social instability.\n\u201cIndustry pays around Rs35 per kWh against an actual cost of Rs29 per kWh, with full bill recovery and negligible line losses. The entire DSS is effectively a cross-subsidy,\u201d Aamir Sheikh maintained.\nArif Bilwani urged the government and NEPRA to abolish peak and off-peak tariff structures to ensure industrial survival.\nAll Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) emphasized that removing the cross-subsidy burden from B3 and B4 consumers would generate economy-wide benefits. Aligning tariffs for large-scale manufacturing with regional benchmarks of around 9 cents per kWh would restore competitiveness, boost exports, attract investment, and create jobs. Increased electricity demand would also improve capacity utilization, reduce per-unit costs, and lower tariffs across all consumer categories.\nRehan Javed proposed several recommendations: (i) transparent disclosure of cross-subsidies embedded in industrial tariffs; (ii) a time-bound plan for eliminating industrial cross-subsidies; (iii) provision of any remaining support through explicit, targeted budget subsidies instead of embedded tariffs; and (iv) ensuring that industrial off-peak consumption is not treated as the primary subsidy pool.\nHe also urged NEPRA to apply voltage-wise allowed loss factors, differentiate distribution margins by voltage, and notify a defined high-voltage cost-of-service adjustment for B-category consumers.\nResponding to industry concerns, Naveed Qaiser said the government remains in continuous consultation with stakeholders to reduce industrial tariffs. He noted that industrial cross-subsidies have been reduced from Rs225 billion to Rs102 billion, equivalent to a reduction of Rs5.13 per kWh.\nOverall industrial tariffs have fallen from Rs62.33 per kWh in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per kWh, a reduction of Rs16.68 per kWh (26 per cent).\nThe Power Division informed the Authority that Pakistan\u2019s current installed power generation capacity stands at 58,013 MW, including 9,590 MW from government-owned power plants, 2,007 MW from hydel IPPs, 11,547 MW from thermal IPPs, and 2,795 MW from renewable IPPs.\nPower available on the National Grid Company system is 36,397 MW, while KE\u2019s generation capacity is 2,647 MW. Net metering contributes 6,340 MW, and off-grid solar stands at 12,629 MW.\nUnder the new Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), installed capacity is projected to reach 87,209 MW by 2035, with 90 per cent clean energy, 10 per cent fossil fuel, 96 per cent local resources, and 4 per cent imported fuel.\nPakistan\u2019s power import bill, which rose from $1.9 billion in 2018 to $2.4 billion, is projected to decline to $0.3 billion by 2035.\nOn solarisation, the Power Division reported that electricity sales declined from 113 billion units in 2023 and are expected to fall to 101 billion units by 2026, largely due to increased solar adoption. This has created a financial burden of approximately Rs3.5 per kWh on DISCO consumers who continue to pay electricity bills.\nFor FY 2026, 116.40 billion units were received, while 113.58 billion units are expected in CY 2026. Electricity sales stood at 103.56 billion units in FY 2026 and are projected at 101.23 billion units in CY 2026. Transmission and distribution losses are expected to decline from 11.04 per cent to 10.87 per cent.\nEnergy charges are projected to decrease by Rs1.74 per kWh, capacity charges to increase by Rs0.50 per kWh, Use of System Charges by Rs0.51 per kWh, and distribution margins by Rs0.26 per kWh.\nPrior year adjustments will rise by Rs0.14 per kWh, while revenue requirements will decline by Rs0.33 per kWh and working capital by Rs0.29 per kWh. Overall, the Net Revenue Requirement is expected to fall by Rs0.61 per kWh during CY 2026.\nNaveed Qaiser further stated that power sector circular debt which stood at Rs 1.6 trillion on June 30, 2025 will remain the same as seasonal variation of Rs 79 billion will be offset.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The National Grid Company (NGC) \u2014 formerly the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) \u2014 and the Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) have reportedly locked horns over the proposed retention of the Standards and Specifications (S&S) organisation, sources close to the Managing Director of PPMC toldBusiness Recorder.\nIn this regard, the Power Division has issued directions to NTDC, while the Minister has provided guidance regarding the transfer of the Standards and Specifications (S&S) function for 11kV and below from NGC to PPMC.\nHowever, as a state-owned enterprise, NGC is required to obtain formal approval from its Board of Directors for any such functional transfer. A due diligence process is currently under way.\nREAD MORE:Rs23bn NGC-PMLTC dispute lands in CPEC panel\u2019s camp\nBased on the findings of a constituted committee and NGC\u2019s institutional experience, the newly appointed Managing Director of NGC, Altaf Hussain Malik, has highlighted several critical risks associated with the proposed transfer.\nSafety and system integrity:The S&S function ensures uniformity, quality, and safety across the power distribution network. NGC possesses decades of engineering expertise, accredited laboratories, and compliance with international standards such as IEC, IEEE, and ANSI. Transferring this role to a non-engineering entity like PPMC\u2014which lacks the requisite technical capacity and testing infrastructure\u2014could compromise equipment reliability, increase system failures, and pose significant public safety risks.\nRegulatory and legal non-compliance:NGC operates under a Nepra licence, with the S&S mandate embedded in the Grid Code. PPMC is an unlicensed entity with no statutory role in engineering standards.\nAny such transfer would violate existing regulations and require extensive legislative and regulatory amendments, creating legal uncertainty and potential audit objections.\nFinancial and operational impact:The S&S office is a profitable, revenue-generating unit for NGC, contributing approximately Rs 30\u201340 million per month. Its transfer without proper financial and operational valuation would result in substantial revenue losses to the national exchequer and disrupt service continuity to DISCOs \u2014 none of which have raised concerns about NGC\u2019s current S&S services.\nMisalignment with sector reforms and global practice:Globally, standards and specifications are managed by utilities and are ultimately vested within distribution companies once they develop in-house capacity.\nTransferring this function to an intermediate, non-technical government entity does not align with international best practices and would add unnecessary bureaucratic layering without any technical or operational benefit.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "19-Change of name: A company can change its name subject to section 10, by special resolution. Section 10 relates to names not allowed.\nPreviously, approval of the Commission was required. The registrar\u2019s existing powers under section 10 to review proposed name appropriateness remain intact, thereby ensuring that regulatory safeguards are still maintained.\nWhere a company changes its name it shall, for a period of ninety days from the date of issue of a certificate by the registrar under sub-section (1), continue to mention its former name along with its new name on the outside of every office or place in which its business is carried on and in every document or notice referred to in section 22.\nREAD MORE:OPINION: Companies Act 2017: Significant proposed amendments by SECP \u2014 I\nProvided that this requirement shall not apply to a single member company and private company, not being Public Interest Company and subsidiary of listed company.\nCommencement of Business: The requirement under section 19 for a separate declaration of \u201ccommencement of business\u201d has become redundant and unnecessary in view of the existing legal and procedural framework. It is now proposed to be eliminated\nRegistered Office: A company shall have a correspondence or registered office to which all communications and notices shall be addressed. In case no registered office address is notified by the Company at time of incorporation, correspondence address shall be deemed as registered office address of the Company for all purposes of the Act.\nPrincipal Line of Business: Under the proposed amendment principle line may be replaced with sector name only in order to simplify procedure and cater requirement of economic survey and other government organization.\nThe International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) will be adopted for sector classification for which concept paper has already been issued. Moreover, change in sector is also not required to be reported on any separate form, such change will be updated in annual return and updated Articles of Association shall be filed with annual return.\nMerger of Public Sector not for profit companies: Public sector company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, may be merged into another public sector for-profit company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, or its assets can be transferred to another public sector for-profit company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, provided that the transferor company has obtained funds or donations or seed money or capital only from the Government. Provided that section 42 company may be merged into another section 42 company, preferably having similar or identical objects subject to the provisions contained in section 284 of the Act.\nPrivate Company to Single Member Company: (1) A private company, not being a public interest company and a subsidiary of a listed company may be converted into a single-member company without prior approval of the Commission in writing by passing a special resolution.\nIssue of Shares at Discount: Subject to sanction of resolution for issue of shares at discount in the case of listed company the mandatory approval of Commission is being dispensed with. This is a step in the right direction.\nReduction in Capital: A private limited company having a share capital may reduce its share capital by special resolution and supported by a solvency statement of all the directors, as referred in Section 89A.\nThe company may reduce its share capital in any way, namely-\n(a) cancel any paid-up share capital which is lost or un-represented by available assets; or for which subscription money has not been received from subscribers;\n(b) pay off any paid-up share capital which is in excess of the needs of the company.\nIt is proposed to be prescribed. This is necessarily required as proposed for voluntary winding up of private limited companies.\n(a) accounting and book keeping services;\n(b) internal audit;\n(c) design and implementation of any financial information system;\n(d) actuarial services;\n(e) investment advisory services;\n(f) investment banking services;\n(g) rendering of outsourced financial services;\n(h) management services; and\n(i) any other kind of services as may be specified: Provided that an auditor or audit firm who or which has been performing any non-audit services shall comply with the provisions of this section before the closure of the first financial year of the company.\nExplanation.\u2014For the purposes of this sub-section, the term \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d shall include rendering of services by the auditor,\u2014\n(i) in case of auditor being an individual, either himself or through his relative or any other person connected or associated with such individual or through any other entity, whatsoever, in which such individual has significant influence or control, or whose name or trade-mark or brand is used by such individual;\n(ii) in case of auditor being a firm, either itself or through any of its partners or through its parent, subsidiary or associate entity or through any other entity, whatsoever, in which the firm or any partner of the firm has significant influence or control, or whose name or trade mark or brand is used by the firm or any of its partners.\nAt present, PSX Rule Book lists down the prohibited services. Pursuant to this a statutory auditor of a listed company is prohibited to provide following non-assurance services:\n(a) Preparing financial statements, accounting records and accounting services;\n(b) Financial information technology system design and implementation, significant to overall financial statements;\n(c) Appraisal or valuation services for material items of financial statements;\n(d) Acting as an Appointed Actuary within the meaning of the term defined by the Insurance Ordinance, 2000;\n(e) Actuarial advice and reviews in respect of provisioning and loss assessments for an insurance entity;\n(f) Internal audit services related to internal accounting controls, financial systems or financial statements;\n(g) Human resource services relating to:\n(i) Executive recruitment;\n(ii) Work performed (including secondments) where management decision will be made on behalf of a listed audit client;\n(h) Legal Services;\n(i) Management functions or decisions;\n(j) Corporate finance services, advice or assistance which may involve independence threats such as promoting, dealing in or underwriting of shares of audit clients;\n(k) Any exercise or assignment for estimation of financial effect of a transaction or event where an auditor provides litigation support services as identified in subsection 607 of the Code of Ethics for Chartered Accountants;\n(l) Share Registration Services (Transfer Agents); and\n(m) Any other service(s) which the Council with the prior approval of the Commission, may determine to be a \u201cprohibited service\u201d.\nRegister of members: Every company shall keep an electronic register of its members. An electronic register must contain such particulars of each member as may be specified.\nPower of Court to Rectify the Register of Members: Section 126 of the Companies Act, 2017 empowered the Court to order rectification of the register of members or debenture-holders in cases of fraudulent or erroneous entry, omission, or unnecessary delay. While this provision provided judicial oversight, in practice it resulted in lengthy, costly, and time-consuming litigation, even for matters of a purely administrative or procedural nature. With the evolution of corporate regulation and increased reliance on electronic filings and real-time data maintenance, the continued requirement of approaching courts for rectification of registers become disproportionate and inconsistent with modern regulatory practices. The retention of section 126 also resulted in duplication of remedies, as similar relief mechanisms already exist under sections 87 and 464 of the Act. Moreover to cater this, section 74A is inserted and sec 464(7) is amended to further address it.\nStatutory Meeting: The elimination of the requirement of holding a statutory meeting is proposed as the provision has no practical utility in the present regulatory framework.\nThe original objective of ensuring initial disclosure of a company\u2019s affairs is already achieved through existing requirements. .\nAnnual General Meeting: Every company is required to hold an annual general meeting within sixteen months from the date of its incorporation and thereafter once in every calendar year within a period of one hundred and twenty days following the close of its financial year. This requirement is proposed to be eliminated for private companies, not being public interest companies and subsidiaries of listed companies, where the board of directors holds at least seventy five percent of voting rights.\nProvisions as to meetings and votes.\u2014 A company may hold a general meeting-\na) at a physical venue; or\nb) by using virtual meeting technology through service providers in the manner prescribed; or c) both at a physical venue and by using virtual meeting technology through service providers in the manner prescribed.\nProvided that from a date to be notified by the Commission, every company shall be required to hold e-meetings and conduct e-voting through a prescribed e-platform, in the manner specified by the Commission, for such class or classes of companies as may be notified.\u2019\nExplanation: \u201cService provider\u201d means any person registered by the Commission to provide an e-platform for meetings in terms of Section 134A.\nCompanies face considerable practical difficulties in allocating nominal shareholding to the independent and woman directors for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of this section. Independent and female directors also face considerable difficulties dealing with ownership of the companies in which they are acting as independent directors, including cumbersome asset disclosures and tax-related disclosures at the time of transfer of shares.\nIndependent Director: The independent director of a listed company shall be elected or appointed in the same manner as specified by the Commission.\nDisqualification of Director: Where a person has been penalised under section 127 of the Act or has contravened the provisions of the sections 182, 184, 197, 208, 222, 243, 254, 261, 272, 324, 400, 401, 402, 405, 418, 424 and 497 or has been penalized under section 193 of the Act, the said person cannot be a director.\nLoan to Directors: Restriction on loan to directors shall not apply in case of loan given to the chief executive or the whole-time director who is an employee of the company, subject to the condition that the loan is given as per the approved company policy for loans to employees.\nMethod of Contracting: These provisions do not relate to Company have been deleted.\nLiability of Undesired Activities: Liability for \u201cundesired activities\u201d is subjective and restrictive for shareholders. Eliminating the section will reduce ambiguity and will give freedom to shareholders who are actual owners of the company.\nInspection of books of account by the Commission: It is proposed that for the purpose of ascertaining whether a company who is complying with or has complied with any provision or requirement of this Act or the terms and conditions of licence or registration, the Commission may from time to time inspect any record or document relating to any company. This provision already exists however it is proposed to clarify the matter.\nDeclaration of Dividend: At present, the following condition prevails:\n(2) No dividend shall be declared or paid by a company for any financial year out of the profits of the company made from the sale or disposal of any immovable property or assets of a capital nature comprised in the undertaking or any of the undertaking of the company, unless the business of the company consists, whether wholly or partly, of selling and purchasing any such property or assets, except after such profits are set off or adjusted against losses arising from the sale of any such immovable property or assets of a capital nature: Provided that no dividend shall be declared or paid out of unrealized gain on investment property credited to profit and loss account.\nThe provision is proposed to be replaced by:\n(2) A resolution of directors passed under subsection (1) shall contain a statement that, in the opinion of the directors, the company will immediately after the distribution, satisfy the solvency test.\nThe deletion of sub-section (2) removes restriction on dividend distribution from capital gains, which no longer reflects modern accounting standards and business realities. Instead, the proposed proviso introduces a solvency test to ensure that dividends, whether from current or accumulated profits, are declared only when the company can meet its financial obligations\nUnclaimed Dividend: The unclaimed dividend shall vest with the Federal Government with oversight by the Commission.\nCost Audit. Provisions relating to \u201cAudit of Cost Accounts\u201d are proposed to be eliminated.\nRight of Commission: A new provision has been inserted to the effect that the Commission may investigate a dispute exists among the members or directors regarding shareholding or directorship arising from a fraudulent entry, an entry made without sufficient cause, or an omission in the relevant statutory register.\nManagement by Administrator. The Commission or the registrar has been given powers to appoint administrators on its own motion also if a situation for appointment of administrator exists. Previously, this right was subject to the approval of members having not less than sixty percent of the paid up capital of a company or a secured creditor or secured creditors having interest equivalent\nProcess of voluntary winding up: The amendment proposes that the Court has no role in the process of voluntary winding-up proceedings, which are intended to be managed independently by the company and its creditors without judicial intervention. Accordingly, the power to approve any extension in the completion of winding-up proceedings has been aligned with the voluntary nature of the process and vested in the company, through a special resolution in the general meeting, and in the creditors\u2019 meeting in case of a creditors\u2019 voluntary winding up. This change ensures procedural consistency, reduces unnecessary court involvement, and promotes efficiency, self-regulation, and timely closure of companies.\nUnregistered Company: An unregistered company \u201cincludes any partnership, association or company consisting of more than seven members\u201d. This definition is proposed to be deleted.\nSecurity clearance of shareholder and director.\u2014The Commission may require the security clearance of any shareholder or director or other office bearer of a company or class of companies as may be notified by the concerned Minister-in-charge of the Federal Government.\nExplanation.\u2014 For the purposes of this section, the expression \u201cMinister-in-Charge of the Federal Government\u201d shall mean the Minister-in-Charge of the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control.\n(a) the document is complete in all material respects and complies with the requirements of law;\n(b) all prescribed fees and penalties, if any, have been duly paid; and\n(c) the document is properly authenticated in the manner prescribed, the registrar shall accept such return or document for registration and record the same in the register.\nThe registrar shall issue a certificate, acknowledgment, or such other confirmation of acceptance as may be prescribed.\nAcceptance of a document or return under this section shall not be construed as a certification of the correctness, validity, or legality of the contents thereof, and the responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the information contained therein shall remain with the company and its officers.\n(i) clear, legible, accessible, and capable of being readily retrieved;\n(ii) maintained in a manner that ensures authenticity, integrity, and reproducibility in accordance with applicable legal standards;\n(iii) capable of being produced or presented to the Commission or any other authority when so required under the law; and\n(iv) protected from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.\n(2) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-section (1), the Commission may, by notification or directive, require any company or class of companies to:-\n(i) maintain records in such system, programme, or format - whether physical, electronic, digital, or any combination thereof - as may be specified; and\n(ii) provide, submit, or transmit data or information in real time, periodic, or batch form through such physical or automated mechanism as may be prescribed, including but not limited to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Data Acquisition Portals (DAPs), Secure File Transfers (FTPs), or other secure and automated data-sharing systems.\n(3) The Commission may prescribe such standards, security protocols, and procedures as it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality, reliability, and lawful use of data transmitted or maintained under this section.\nThe Commission or the registrar may, upon an application being made to it within sixty days from the date of any order passed by it otherwise than in revision under sub-section (1), or on its own motion, review such order, and such review order shall be final.\nAn order passed or made by the Federal Government under this Act shall be subject to review by the Federal Government of its own motion or on an application made to it within sixty days from the date of the order.\nThe orders relating to mergers, etc., are supposed to be excluded from this provision.\nAppeal against order passed by officer of the Commission. Any person aggrieved by any order passed under this Act may, within thirty days of such order, except as otherwise provided in this Act, prefer an appeal to an officer authorized by the Commission where the order has been passed or upheld by the Registrar of Companies. Consequential to amendments proposed in section 464(6) & (7) where powers are given/amended to the Registrar of Companies. In light of these amendments, the appellate structure envisaged under section 480(a), which provides for an appeal to a registrar designated by the Commission against orders passed by officers subordinate to the Registrar, has become redundant and no longer relevant in the context of actions taken under sections 464(6) and (7).\nDefinition of the term \u2018material\u2019. It is proposed that it would mean any information which, if altered or obscured, would reasonably influence the decision of the stakeholders relying on such information.\n(Concluded)\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nSyed Shabbar Zaidi & Co.\nThe views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the newspaper",

      "summary": "Siemens (Pakistan) Engineering (PSX: SIEM) was incorporated in Pakistan as a public limited company in 1953. Siemens AG, Germany (parent company) has the majority stake of 93.03 percent in the company followed by general public holding 3.31 percent of SIEM\u2019s shares. GP margin also slumped from 16.9 percent in 2018 to 15 percent in 2019. Administrative expense grew by 20.20 percent year-on-year in 2019 on the back of higher payroll expense despite drop in the number of employees from 665 to 602. SIEM\u2019s fate turned around in 2021 as its topline posted 12 percent year-on-year rise to clock in at Rs.14,348.95 million. The sales growth was mainly backed by energy transmission business which received new orders worth Rs.15 billion in 2021 versus new orders of Rs.5.6 billion in previous year. Despite geopolitical and macroeconomic impediments in 2022, SIEM\u2019s topline posted a staggering 30.37 percent year-on-year improvement. The major wins of 2022 were energy transmission contract with K-Electric to build the KANUPP. SIEM\u2019s net sales grew by a splendid 56.9 percent year-on-year to clock in at Rs.29,351.73 million. Contract with NTDC for the construction of grid station at Allama Iqbal Industrial city/ M-3 Faislabad was the major achievement for SIEM. SIEM\u2019s net finance expense magnified by 1142.14 percent in 2023 as the company obtained short-term borrowings worth Rs.4048.937 million during the year. The company streamlined its workforce to 487 employees in 2024 from 498 employees in2023. SIEM recorded net sales of Rs.12,427.111 million, down 64.66 percent year-on-year. Gross profit enhanced by 31.20 percent to clock in at Rs.2914.155 million in 2025. In 2025, SIEM sold off its energy business to Siemens Energy Pakistan (Private) Limited. SIEM posted operating profit of Rs.1466.41 million in 2025, up 837.62 percent year-on-year. The company is putting diligent efforts to grab more orders from Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries.",
      "fullText": "Siemens (Pakistan) Engineering (PSX: SIEM) was incorporated in Pakistan as a public limited company in 1953. The principal activity of the company is the implementation of projects under contracts and also manufacturing, installation and sale of electronic and electrical capital goods.\nSIEM\u2019s business portfolio includes smart infrastructure, digital industries, smart grid and smart buildings, power generation and distribution as well as automation and digitization, to name a few.\nPattern of Shareholding\nAs of September 30, 2025, SIEM has a total of 8.247 million shares outstanding which are held by 1261 shareholders. Siemens AG, Germany (parent company) has the majority stake of 93.03 percent in the company followed by general public holding 3.31 percent of SIEM\u2019s shares.\nAdamjee Insurance Company Limited accounts for 1.80 percent of SIEM\u2019s shares. The remaining shares of SIEM are held by other categories of shareholders.\nHistorical Performance (2019-24)\nSIEM\u2019s topline and bottomline which had been on the skids in 2019 and 2020 boasted a turnaround in 2021 whereby the company not only posted topline growth but also recovered from the net loss posted in the previous year. In the subsequent years, the topline continued to expand.\nDespite strengthening net sales, the bottomline slid in 2023 and ended up in the negative zone in 2024. The margins which had been declining until 2020 picked up in 2021 and 2022 only to fall back in 2023 and 2024.\nSIEM\u2019s margins posted their optimum level in 2022 and their weakest level in 2024 (see the graph of profitability ratios). The detailed performance review of the period under consideration is given below.\nIn 2019, SIEM\u2019s topline dropped by 14.59 percent year-on-year to clock in at Rs.16,672.92 million. This came on the back of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in Pakistan and also because some major projects in Afghanistan were completed in 2018.\nCost of sales slid by 12.64 percent year-on-year in 2019, however, high per unit cost due to inflation and Pak Rupee depreciation and also because of high fixed overhead cost due to low capacity utilization, pushed down gross profit by 24.21 percent year-on-year in 2019.\nGP margin also slumped from 16.9 percent in 2018 to 15 percent in 2019. Distribution expense inched down by 2.17 percent year-on-year in 2019 mainly on account of higher commission income earned during the year and also because of reversal of allowance on deposits and other receivables. Administrative expense grew by 20.20 percent year-on-year in 2019 on the back of higher payroll expense despite drop in the number of employees from 665 in 2018 to 602 in 2019.\nOther income nosedived by 80.76 percent year-on-year in 2019 because of lesser liabilities written back during the year and lesser insurance claims. Other expense also shrank by 46.22 percent year-on-year in 2019 which was the result of lower provisioning for WWF and WPPF.\nDespite a check on expenses, operating profit fell by 37.13 percent year-on-year in 2019 with OP margin sliding down to 8.6 percent from OP margin of 11.7 percent recorded in 2018.\nNet finance expense magnified by 444.26 percent year-on-year in 2019 due to higher discount rate. This culminated into 38.8 percent year-on-year decline in net profit which clocked in at Rs.709.47 million in 2019 with NP margin of 4.26 percent versus NP margin of 5.94 percent recorded in 2018. EPS also dwindled from Rs.140.56 in 2018 to Rs.86.03 in 2019.\n2020 brought about further 23.20 percent decline in SIEM\u2019s topline which was recorded at Rs.12,805.38 million. This was on account of COVID-19 which completely halted economic activities for three months and slowed down the growth momentum for the rest of the year.\nCost of sales shriveled by 15.92 percent year-on-year in 2020, yet couldn\u2019t prevent the gross profit from slipping by 64.42 percent year-on-year in 2020.\nGP margin plunged to 6.95 percent in 2020.\nDistribution expense tapered off by 7 percent year-on-year in 2020 on account of reversal of loss allowance on trade receivables and also because of the discounting of long-term loans and trade receivables.\nAdministrative expense grew by 7.23 percent year-on-year in 2020 due to higher payroll expense on account of inflation. This was despite the fact that the number of employees was reduced to 539 in 2020.\nOther income didn\u2019t offer any support either and went down by 46.49 percent year-on-year in 2020 due to lower gain on sale of property, plant and equipment and also because of no insurance claims recorded during the year.\nSIEM didn\u2019t incur any other expense during the year as the company didn\u2019t book any provisioning for WWF and WPPF in 2020.\nThe company incurred operating loss of Rs. 55.44 million in 2020. While the company availed SBP Refinance scheme for the payment of salaries and wages and also obtained lease liabilities which built up its long-term liabilities, short-term borrowings majorly reduced during 2020. This coupled with lower discount rate in the second half of 2020 (year ending September), resulted in 26.40 percent year-on-year decline in net finance expense.\nSIEM posted net loss of Rs.496.015 in 2020 with loss per share of Rs.60.14.\nSIEM\u2019s fate turned around in 2021 as its topline posted 12 percent year-on-year rise to clock in at Rs.14,348.95 million. In 2021, topline growth came after two successive years of decline.\nThe sales growth was mainly backed by energy transmission business which received new orders worth Rs.15 billion in 2021 versus new orders of Rs.5.6 billion in the previous year.\nTargeted measures of cost optimization resulted in 172.29 percent year-on-year rise in gross profit in 2021 with GP margin jumping up to 16.9 percent, the level last seen in 2018. Distribution expense grew by 20.83 percent year-on-year in 2021 as a result of low commission income as well as high payroll expense incurred during the year.\nAdministrative expense also posted year-on-year rise of 9.6 percent in 2021. SIEM also booked allowance worth Rs.149.95 million for ECL in 2021 as against reversal of Rs.13.99 million recorded in the previous year.\nHowever, it was nullified by the gain of Rs. 247.85 million on disposal of leasehold land and building during the year.\nSIEM also made other income of Rs.65.08 million during the year which was 441.70 percent higher than that recorded in 2020. This mainly comprised of liabilities no longer payable written back during the year.\nUnlike last year when the company incurred losses and didn\u2019t book any provisioning for WWF and WPPF, the company booked provisioning of Rs.85.3 million in 2021. SIEM recorded operating profit of Rs.1360.13 million in 2021 with OP margin of 9.48 percent.\nThe lucky streak continued as the company recognized net finance income of Rs.29.92 in 2021, as against the rest of the years under consideration where it incurred net finance expense. This was on account of a massive decline in borrowings coupled with low discount rate post COVID-19.\nSIEM posted net profit of Rs.850.01 million in 2021 with NP margin of 5.92 percent. EPS clocked in at Rs. 103.07 in 2021.\nDespite geopolitical and macroeconomic impediments in 2022, SIEM\u2019s topline posted a staggering 30.37 percent year-on-year improvement to clock in at Rs.18,707.06 million. The major wins of 2022 were energy transmission contract with K-Electric to build the KANUPP as well as gaining SAP license, implementation and maintenance contract for NTDC.\nSIEM also recorded gain of Rs.2000.72 million on derivatives due to sharp depreciation of Pak Rupee during the year. Cost of sales grew by 32.76 percent year-on-year mainly on account of Pak Rupee depreciation, fuel and power price hikes as well as inflationary pressure.\nHowever, robust revenue and gain on derivatives translated into 101.14 percent rise in gross profit with GP margin climbing up to 26 percent \u2013 the highest ever achieved by the company.\nA major hit to SIEM\u2019s profitability in 2022 came from expected credit losses aggregating Rs.874.11 million recorded during the year due to geopolitical impediments in the energy transmission business which made SIEM\u2019s credit recoveries questionable.\nDistribution expense escalated by 8.52 percent year-on-year in 2021 which was primarily on account of a spike in payroll expense, receivables written off during the year, advertising and promotion as well as travelling charges.\nAdministrative expense also registered 8.48 percent hike in 2022 on the back of payroll expense as the number of employees grew from 536 in 2021 to 576 in 2022. Other income shrank by 50.46 percent in 2022 as lesser amount of liabilities was written back in 2022 when compared to the previous year. 125.49 percent higher other expense incurred in 2022 was due to higher provisioning done for WWF and WPPF.\nOperating profit boasted 91.4 percent year-on-year growth with OP margin rising to 13.92 percent in 2022. SIEM incurred net finance expense of Rs.22.97 million in 2022 which was the result of higher discount rate. Bottomline grew by 103 percent year-on-year in 2022 to clock in at Rs.1725.98 million with NP margin of 9.23 percent and EPS of Rs.209.28.\nIn 2023, SIEM\u2019s net sales grew by a splendid 56.9 percent year-on-year to clock in at Rs.29,351.73 million. This was mainly on account of energy transmission business. Contract with NTDC for the construction of grid station at Allama Iqbal Industrial city/ M-3 Faislabad was the major achievement for SIEM within the energy business.\nGain on derivatives also improved by 54.63 percent in 2023. Cost of sales grew by 70.93 percent year-on-year in 2023 due to rising commodity prices, Pak Rupee depreciation and soaring inflation. Gross profit inched up by 10.44 percent in 2023, however, GP margin drastically fell to 18.35 percent. 23.45 percent escalation in distribution expense in 2023 was the result of higher payroll expense and a surge in IT, data communication and networking charges. Furthermore, the company made no scrap sales and a petite commission income during the year.\nAdministrative expense escalated by 19.94 percent in 2023 due to higher payroll expense incurred during the year despite the fact that SIEM trimmed its workforce from 576 employees in 2022 to 498 employees in 2023.\nAllowance for ECL mounted by 47.57 percent in 2023. Other income also contracted by 56.42 percent in 2023 due to lesser liabilities written back during the year. Lesser profit related provisioning during the year translated into 80.59 percent lower other expense incurred during the year. All these factors translated into 1.87 percent lower operating profit in 2023 with OP margin sinking to 8.7 percent.\nSIEM\u2019s net finance expense magnified by 1142.14 percent in 2023 as the company obtained short-term borrowings worth Rs.4048.937 million during the year. Increased borrowings coupled with higher discount rate greatly took its toll on the bottomline of the company which slid by 17.92 percent year-on-year to clock in at Rs.1416.676 million in 2023 with EPS of Rs.117.72 and NP margin of 4.83 percent.\nIn 2024, SIEM\u2019s net sales grew by 19.81 percent to clock in at Rs.35,166.30 million. This was mainly on account of demand from the industrial business segments i.e. smart infrastructure and digital industries.\nNew orders of Rs. 26,079 million were recorded in 2024. However, this couldn\u2019t cascade down as unrealized loss incurred on measurement of foreign currency derivatives (due to appreciation of Pak Rupee against foreign currencies) and high cost of sales suppressed gross profit by 58.76 percent year-on-year in 2024. GP margin drastically fell to its lowest level of 6.32 percent in 2024.\nDistribution expense mounted by 35.48 percent in 2024 due to higher payroll expense, business support service charges as well as IT, communication and networking charges incurred during the year.\nThe company streamlined its workforce to 487 employees in 2024 from 498 employees in 2023, resulting in 33 percent diminution in administrative expense in 2024. Allowance for ECL contracted by 75.50 percent in 2024.\nOther expense dropped by 93.34 percent in 2024 as the company reversed the provision booked for WWF. Other income improved by 116.36 percent in 2024. Operating profit tapered off by 93.88 percent in 2024 with OP margin thinning down to 0.44 percent.\nThe execution of large-scale energy projects during the year required greater borrowings which coupled with elevated discount rate resulted in 590.59 percent higher net finance cost incurred by SIEM in 2024. As a consequence, the company incurred net loss of Rs.2048.087 million in 2024. This translated into loss per share of Rs.248.34 in 2024.\nRecent Performance (2025)\nIn 2025, SIEM recorded net sales of Rs.12,427.111 million, down 64.66 percent year-on-year. This included sales by smart infrastructure and digital industries. Gross profit enhanced by 31.20 percent to clock in at Rs.2914.155 million in 2025.\nIn 2025, SIEM sold off its energy business to Siemens Energy Pakistan (Private) Limited.\nThis resulted in unrealized gain recorded on foreign currency derivatives worth Rs.705.082 million due to economic transfers of underlying foreign currency host contracts in 2025. This was against the loss on derivates worth Rs.2596.753 million recorded in the previous year which took its toll on the gross profit in 2024. GP margin clocked in at 23.45 percent in 2025 versus GP margin of 6.32 percent posted in 2024.\nDistribution expense dipped by 12.57 percent while administrative expense dropped by 25.92 percent in 2025 due to lesser operating expense from discontinued operations incurred during the year.\nSEIM also booked reversal of allowance booked for ECL worth Rs.78.576 from continued operations and Rs.79.291 from discontinued operations in 2025. This was against the allowance of Rs.316.05 million booked on ECL in 2024.\nOther income massively dropped from Rs.30.39 million in 2024 to Rs.3.40 million in 2025, down 88.82 percent year-on-year as the company wrote off liabilities no longer payable in the previous year. In contrast to other income, other expense mounted from Rs.2.49 million in 2024 to Rs.92.20 million in 2025 due to high-base effect as the company recorded reversal on provision booked on WWF in 2024.\nSIEM posted operating profit of Rs.1466.41 million in 2025, up 837.62 percent year-on-year.\nThis translated into OP margin of 11.80 percent in 2025 versus OP margin of 0.44 percent posted in 2024. Net finance income of Rs.213.39 million recorded in 2025 versus net finance expense of Rs.1970.12 million registered in 2024 also greatly buttressed the bottomline.\nNet finance income was due to no outstanding short-term liabilities in 2025 and also because of higher profit on bank deposits due to improved liquidity position of the company.\nGain on sale of business worth Rs.65.151 million was also recorded in 2025. This translated into net profit of Rs.829.413 million in 2025 versus net loss of Rs.2048.087 million posted in 2024. EPS was recorded at Rs.100.57 in 2025 versus loss per share of Rs.248.34 recorded in 2024. NP margin clocked in at 6.67 percent in 2025.\nFuture Outlook\nAfter the sale of its energy business, SIEM\u2019s business portfolio now comprises of Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries. The company is putting diligent efforts to grab more orders from these segments.\nImprovement in macroeconomic indicators provides impetus for better business environment and demand recovery for SIEM.",

      "fullText": "Weak performance by Pakistan\u2019s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country\u2019s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.\nThe report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with \u201crigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)\u201d to reduce tariffs were a milestone.\nHowever, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.\n\u201cOverall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,\u201d the report read.\nRead more:ECC approves Rs659.65bn govt guarantee for circular debt financing\nThe regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the \u201cold era of scarcity is ending\u201d, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might \u201cprove to be even more complex\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.\nIn its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.\nMeanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the \u2018Take or Pay\u2019 electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.\nNEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.\n\u201cA significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan\u2019s power system.\u201d\nThe regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.\n\u201cIt remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.\u201d\nOn the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.\nRead more:Circular debt rose Rs79bn on \u2018seasonable, operational factors\u2019: Power Division\nAt the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.\n\u201cGovernance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan\u2019s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,\u201d the NEPRA report said.\nKE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.\nIn contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.\nQESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.\nIn terms of recovery, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) was the best-placed DISCO with a recovery rate of 101.7%, followed by GEPCO and LESCO.",

The regulator emphasized that power sector entities must operate under commercially binding agreements. Nepra noted that challenges faced by power sector entities span planning, execution, and operational domains. Weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management further constrain the sector\u2019s ability to provide reliable and affordable electricity. Part Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) added Rs46.388 billion to generation costs in FY 2024-25.

Weak DISCO performance contributed approximately Rs397 billion to circular debt during the year. Nepra termed load-shedding based on AT&C losses unlawful and inequitable.",
      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: An assessment of Pakistan\u2019s power sector during FY 2024-25 prompted National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to observe that despite several structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remains limited and insufficient to inspire confidence in the sector\u2019s ability to support sustained industrial growth or provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential segments.\nIn its State of the Industry Report 2024-25, NEPRA stated that the power sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain efficiency and undermine its contribution to economic development.\nThe regulator emphasized that power sector entities must operate under commercially binding agreements that clearly define roles, performance standards, and accountability mechanisms.\nREAD MORE:NEPRA could come under Power Division\u2019s control, as per govt\u2019s latest amendments\nEach entity should bear the financial consequences of its inefficiencies rather than passing these costs on to consumers, who are currently burdened with approximately Rs233 billion in Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)\u2014a cost arising not from normal business operations but from inefficiencies within certain sector entities.\nAccording to the report, generation capacity under \u201cTake or Pay\u201d contracts remains significantly underutilized, resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants. Simultaneously, the transmission network is both constrained and underutilized, contributing to higher transmission tariffs and preventing the dispatch of cheaper and more efficient electricity in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).\nOn the distribution side, several government-owned DISCOs continue to suffer from poor governance, with transmission and distribution (T&D) losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery, and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. These inefficiencies further exacerbate asset underutilisation across generation, transmission, and distribution, while fueling the circular debt problem.\nNepra noted that challenges faced by power sector entities\u2014largely government-owned\u2014span planning, execution, and operational domains.\nPersistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered financial sustainability and limited the sector\u2019s contribution to economic growth. Weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management further constrain the sector\u2019s ability to provide reliable and affordable electricity.\nDuring FY 2024-25, efforts were made to reduce \u201cTake or Pay\u201d generation capacity through the retirement or decommissioning of inefficient power plants with consistently low utilisation. As a result, 2,829 MW of capacity was retired, decommissioned, or had its Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) terminated.\nConsequently, effective operational generation capacity declined to 41,121 MW as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888 MW a year earlier. However, 884 MW of new hydropower capacity\u2014Suki Kinari Hydropower Project\u2014was added during the year.\nThe utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the CPPA-G system remained 38.82%. NEPRA highlighted that generation costs account for nearly 82% of the electricity tariff. During FY 2024-25, the actual per-unit Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) stood at Rs14.21/kWh, the highest component of the electricity tariff, primarily due to underutilisation of \u201cTake or Pay\u201d plants.\nDuring the year, several power plants approached NEPRA through CPPA-G seeking reductions in generation tariffs. Approval of these adjustments is expected to yield long-term benefits by lowering generation costs, improving tariff efficiency, and stabilizing consumer prices, while also supporting investor confidence through a predictable regulatory environment.\nHowever, NEPRA noted that persistent inefficiencies in public sector power plants \u2014 such as the 747 MW Guddu Power Plant, 969 MW Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, and several WAPDA-operated hydro plants\u2014are undermining tariff reduction efforts. These inefficiencies result in lower utilisation, higher costs, and reduced system efficiency, offsetting gains from IPP tariff reductions and plant retirements.\nThe Part Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) added Rs46.388 billion to generation costs in FY 2024-25, compared to Rs55.671 billion in 2023-24, and, while unavoidable, these costs can be significantly reduced through effective demand-side management.\nSimilarly, Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) costs declined to Rs13.285 billion, from Rs39.521 billion, though NEPRA said further reductions are possible through better grid management.\nLower utilisation of Thar coal-based power plants, which operated at 67.23% utilisation, also raised generation costs by inflating both CPP and Energy Purchase Price (EPP). Delays in ensuring regular coal supply to Lucky Electric Power Company further exacerbated inefficiencies.\nNepra observed widespread underutilisation of transmission assets, including the 4,000 MW Matiari\u2013Lahore HVDC line, which operated at just 35% utilisation despite payments based on full availability. Manual system logs further hinder accurate assessment of transmission performance.\nThe poor performance of the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) has led to violations of the economic merit order, increased generation costs, project delays, and cost overruns. Delays in key projects\u2014including KE-NGC interconnection, Lahore North Grid, and SCADA-III\u2014have adversely affected system reliability and finances.\nGovernance remains the most critical issue confronting DISCOs. KE, PESCO, HESCO, SEPCO, and QESCO were identified as the poorest performers, with excessive losses, low recovery, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Except for TESCO, no DISCO met Nepra-approved T&D loss targets.\nWeak DISCO performance contributed approximately Rs397 billion to circular debt during the year. Nepra termed load-shedding based on AT&C losses unlawful and inequitable, as it penalizes compliant consumers and deepens sector inefficiencies.\nRising electricity costs and poor service have pushed consumers\u2014particularly affluent ones\u2014towards rooftop solar PV systems and battery storage, reducing grid demand during non-solar hours.\nNepra also expressed concern over the underperformance of the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO), citing limited adoption of modern technologies and the absence of a fully functional SCADA system.\nThe regulator concluded that Pakistan\u2019s power sector transformation remains incomplete without full implementation of the 1992 WAPDA Restructuring Plan, emphasizing corporatization, decentralization, privatization, and separation of policy, regulation, and operations. Continued centralized control, overlapping mandates, and weak accountability, it warned, will perpetuate inefficiencies and impose unnecessary financial burdens on the economy.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: President of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), Muhammad Ikram Rajput, has called for the immediate abolition of cross-subsidy embedded in electricity tariffs for industries, stating that the additional cost ranging from Rs4.5 to Rs7 per unit is rendering industrial operations increasingly uncompetitive and financially unviable.\nHe said the industrial sector is already grappling with high production costs, weak demand, and mounting financial pressures. In such circumstances, the cross-subsidy amounting to nearly a 20 percent additional burden has made it difficult for many industrial units to sustain even routine operations.\nQuestioning the policy rationale, Rajput said that if, as claimed by the Ministry of Energy, performance in the power sector has improved, it is difficult to understand why a competitive electricity tariff of around 9 cents per unit for industry remains unattainable. \u201cIf the sector is indeed stabilised, why are the benefits not being passed directly on to industrial consumers?\u201d he asked.President KATI stressed that without affordable and competitive electricity, neither export growth nor sustainable job creation is possible. He warned that the Prime Minister\u2019s stated objective of boosting exports and ultimately exiting the IMF programme cannot be achieved as long as industry continues to bear the burden of policies unrelated to its actual consumption or performance.\nRajput also expressed concern over the design of the current three-year incremental consumption package. He noted that while the previous winter package offered broad-based relief to industry, the current scheme is restrictive, excluding several industrial units particularly those whose electricity consumption was higher between December 2023 and November 2024.\nHe further criticised the load factors imposed by the Power Division, stating that there is no clear technical or regulatory justification for applying such benchmarks in a concessional package intended to stimulate electricity demand.\nThese parameters, he said, appear to have been borrowed from anti-theft and detection billing mechanisms, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the package.\nInstead of encouraging additional consumption, the scheme risks merely shifting demand within the industrial sector.\nThe KATI president urged Federal Minister for Energy (Power Division) Sardar Awais Leghari to immediately remove cross-subsidy from industrial electricity bills and to undertake a comprehensive review of the incremental consumption package so that it genuinely supports increased industrial activity.\nHe said the future of industry, export competitiveness, and overall economic recovery is directly linked to fair, transparent, and rational electricity pricing.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Tax Ombudsman (FTO) has resolved a major dispute between the two tax offices of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on matter related to deduction and deposit of withholding tax under Section 235 of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001 on electricity bills of the consumers.\nThe FTO has stopped Regional Tax Office (RTO) Islamabad from issuing any further coercive notices to Hazara Electric Supply Company Limited (HAZECO).\nIn this regard, the FTO has issued an order against FBR.\n\u201cNeedless to emphasise, the instant complaint also represents a critical failure in the internal coordination and smacks of a blatant disregard for regulatory dispensations devised by FBR (HQ). Since the matter falls squarely in the administrative domain of Member Operations (IR), his indulgence is called for resolving the matter definitively,\u201d the FTO order added.\nThe complaint was filed under Section 10(1) of the Federal Tax Ombudsman Ordinance 2000 (FTO Ordinance) primarily against RTO, Abbottabad for erroneously diverting the tax deduction for the month of September, 2025, amounting to Rs 180 million and additionally against CTO, Islamabad for initiating coercive measures through issuance of Show Cause notices in the name of senior officials of Hazara Electric Supply Company Limited.\nFacts of the case are that the complainant is a registered electricity distribution company registered with CTO, Islamabad. HAZECO shoulders the responsibility of withholding tax under Section 235 of the ITO, 2001\non electricity bills of the consumers and subsequent deposit to the FBR as per procedure laid down in Circular of 2022. The complainant company routinely creates PSIDs and provides the same to its bankers through which the bank makes payment of tax withheld by the HAZECO to the FBR field formation i.e. Corporate Tax Office, Islamabad.\nIn line with the past practice, the HAZECO generated PSID u/s 235 for the month of September 2025 thereby crediting the payment to the Chief Commissioner, CTO, Islamabad. It was later discovered that the officials of RTO, Abbottabad exerted pressure on the bank authorities and managed to create another PSID misusing HAZECO particulars and submitted the same to the bank, thus diverting the amount of withheld taxes to RTO, Abbottabad.\nFeeling aggrieved, the CTO, Islamabad issued multiple show cause notices to the senior officials of HAZECO for their alleged connivance in erroneously crediting the tax amount to the tune of Rs 180 million to RTO, Abbotabad. These acts on part of both the formations caused undue harassment and anxiety for the complainant. The HAZECO has also agitated against the issuance of repeated notices to its functionaries.\nDuring the course of proceedings, it has emerged that the HAZECO stands registered with CTO, Islamabad. The Regional Tax Office Abbotabad has been incessantly vying to have the jurisdiction transferred to it on the premise that the Company is primarily carrying on its business ventures in Hazara Division and the entrustment of jurisdiction to RTO, Abbotabad would ensure proper monitoring and better realization of withholding taxes. The request is yet to be granted by the FBR (HQ).\nFurthermore, both the field formations are relying on one instrument to justify their acts. Circular No. 01 of 2022, dated 01.07.2021 prescribes the dispensation of bifurcation of tax deducted between field formations.\nThe FTO has directed Member (Operations) to examine the matter and address the rift in consonance with Circular No. 01 of 2022.\nThe FBR will direct the chief commissioner CTO Islamabad to desist from issuing any further coercive notices to the complainant company and retract show cause notices already issued to HAZECO office holders, the FTO added.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: Shakil Ashfaq, President of the Bin Qasim Association of Trade and Industry (BQATI), has expressed grave concern over the continued imposition of cross-subsidy on industrial electricity tariffs, stating that this policy is directly undermining industrial productivity, discouraging investment, and eroding Pakistan\u2019s export competitiveness.\nHe noted that industrial electricity tariffs currently carry a cross-subsidy ranging from Rs 4.5 to Rs 7 per unit, adding nearly 20 percent to power costs that are already uncompetitive by regional standards. He stated that industry is no longer in a position to absorb this burden, and many industrial units are operating under extreme financial stress.\nShakil Ashfaq pointed out that despite having a broad base of small industrial units, Pakistan has failed to build and sustain large-scale industry\u2014particularly in energy-intensive sectors operating in the Bin Qasim industrial zone. He emphasised that distorted and punitive electricity pricing discourages expansion, modernization, and long-term planning, forcing industries to remain small, underutilized, or unviable.\nHe further highlighted that the number of protected consumers has increased substantially in recent years. However, instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal measures, the government has chosen to recover the cost directly from industry. He termed this approach unfair and economically damaging, noting that industry has been treated as a convenient adjustment mechanism even while it faces declining demand, rising input costs, and persistent uncertainty.\nCommenting on the Incremental Consumption Package, Shakil said the scheme suffers from serious design flaws and structural anomalies. He pointed out that industries which maintained higher electricity consumption during the reference period December 2023 to November 2024 have been declared ineligible, despite being consistent contributors to system demand.\nHe also questioned the load factors applied in the package, stating that they have no technical or regulatory basis for an incentive framework. He said these factors appear to be borrowed from theft and detection billing methodologies, which are meant for enforcement and not for incentivizing demand growth, adding that the package has therefore lost its intended purpose.\n\u201cThis design will not increase overall electricity demand,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt will only shift demand within the industrial sector, create artificial distortions, and reward behavior that has no connection to real economic productivity.\u201d\nShakil Ashfaq also challenged repeated claims by the Power Ministry regarding improvements in the performance of the power sector. He stated that if the sector has genuinely improved, a competitive industrial tariff of around 9 cents per unit should already be achievable. The continued absence of such a tariff, he said, raises serious concerns about policy direction and priorities.\nHe urged the government to immediately remove cross-subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs, correct the anomalies in the Incremental Consumption Package, and align energy policy with the national objective of industrial growth rather than short-term revenue recovery.\nHe concluded by stating that Pakistan cannot achieve export expansion, employment generation, or economic stability while systematically weakening its productive sector. Unless these structural distortions are removed, industrial confidence will continue to erode and the economy will remain trapped in stagnation.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

After PPMC is fully manned, it would be a sole designated entity. During audit of the accounts of MD, PPMC Islamabad for 2024-25, it was observed that Designated Entity, ie, PPMC had failed to achieve multiple Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets assigned under the NEP 2023-27 upto the FY 2024-25.\nAGP raises questions over \u2018malfeasance\u2019 in Power Division think tank\nThese included non-achievement of critical deliverables such as development of the integrated energy plan design, establishment of the Central Electrification Registry, institutionalization of strategic risk management, preparation of system value and tariff evaluation frameworks, operationalisation of MRV mechanism for GHG emissions, establishment of the R&D Secretariat, development of the Central Platform for R&D, initiation of minimum required R&D projects, and publishing of due-diligence and electrification reports within mandated timelines.\nAccording to AGP, the lapse occurred due to insufficient institutional capacity, delays in staffing and operationalisation of PPMC, lack of a robust internal monitoring mechanism for tracking NEP deliverables, and inadequate coordination with CPPA-G and other sectoral stakeholders.\nFurthermore, strategic planning functions were not fully established, resulting in weak implementation oversight and slow progress on mandated tasks. Failure to meet these NEP targets has resulted in delays in sectoral reforms, weakened progress toward national electrification, de-carbonization, risk management, and R&D institutionalization objectives, and compromised the Government\u2019s ability to implement the National Action Plan (2023-27) within stipulated timelines.\n\u201cInefficient performance resulted in non-achievement of key deliverables of the National Electricity Plan 2023-27 by designated entity PPMC upto the period 2024-25,\u201d the AGP said adding that the matter was taken up with the management in December, 2025. No reply was received to date.\nAudit has recommended that PPMC should immediately develop and implement a robust action plan to achieve all pending NEP 2023-27 deliverables within stipulated timelines. The Ministry of Energy (Power Division) should strengthen monitoring, reporting,\nThe AGP further stated that during audit of the accounts of MD, PPMC Islamabad for 2024-25, it was observed that despite the Cabinet\u2019s approval to transfer the function of developing uniform designs, standards, and specifications (11kV and below) for distribution sector from NGC/NTDC to PPMC, and subsequent instructions by Power Division on 19.05.2025, the designated function was neither timely established nor fully operationalised.\nThe BoD in its meeting held on April 10,2025 approved the inclusion of the strategy energy Financing and Design and Standards functions within the organizational structure of PPMC and HR and Legal Committee in its 139th meeting of May 26, 2025 approved the 15 posts excluding support staff. However, delays persisted in deployment of technical HR, transfer of documentation, systems handover, and establishment of operational readiness. As a result, functional control over distribution design and specifications remained fragmented between NGC/NTDC and PPMC.\nThe AGP maintained that this delay, caused by inadequate follow-up after Cabinet approval, absence of a structured implementation roadmap, and slow migration of resources, has led to non-uniform technical standards across DISCOs, risks of procurement and design inconsistencies, potential quality deviations, and hindered achievement of the National Electricity Policy 2021 goal of a standardized, efficient, and optimized distribution system.\nNon-adherence to cabinet directive and NEP-2021 resulted in delayed transfer and non-operationalisation of design, standards and specification (DSS) function from NGC to PPM? upto the period 2024-25. The matter was taken up with the management in December, 2025. No reply was received to date.\nAudit recommended that PPMC should expedite full operationalisation of the design & standards function by completing staff deployment, system transfer, and implementation milestones in line with cabinet directives and NEP-2021.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "NEPRA\u2019s FY26 tariff decision shows a puzzling divergence between consumer classification, electricity consumption, and solar capacity estimates. On the residential side, the number of protected consumers rises to 21.5 million from 17 million in the government motion.\nThe largest increase is in the 101\u2013200 kWh slab, now counting 12.53 million consumers. Total consumption for this slab remains 3.89 billion kWh, translating to about 26 kWh per household per month. This is far below the lower bound of the slab and suggests administrative reclassification or policy-driven inflation rather than actual usage.\nHouseholds in the 1\u2013100 kWh category average 163 kWh per month, consistent with low-consumption behavior. The mismatch compresses per-consumer allocations and raises questions about fairness in subsidy targeting.\nOn the commercial front, numbers are more consistent. Nepra lists 3.52 million commercial consumers, up from 2.97 million in the motion.\nTotal consumption remains unchanged. This aligns with 3.5 million consumers recorded in the July 2025 base tariff, suggesting a routine reconciliation of records. The contrast shows that residential slab anomalies are likely due to methodology or policy choices rather than systemic errors.\nThe decision also addresses solarization. It cites a Power Planning & Monitoring Company (PPMC) report estimating 12,629 MW of off-grid solar capacity, in addition to 6,539 MW of net-metered installations, for a total of nearly 19,000 MW.\nThe report is not public, and the cut-off date is unclear. Import data suggests that cumulative solar panel imports already amount to around 50,000 MW, far higher than the official estimate.\nIt is also unclear whether behind-the-meter residential or commercial solar is included. Nepra assumes this capacity will generate nearly 30 billion kWh outside the grid, based on 4.5 hours of daily irradiation, and estimates the impact on base tariffs at Rs3.5 per unit.\nThe key risk is that underestimating off-grid and behind-the-meter solar could jeopardize demand-side planning and grid management. If actual capacity is far higher than official estimates, the base tariff and subsidy framework may fail to reflect true consumption patterns, distorting financial planning and resource allocation.\nThe anomalies in residential slabs and the underestimation of solar capacity point to deeper challenges in Pakistan\u2019s electricity planning. Inflated consumer counts in higher protected slabs dilute actual subsidy coverage.\nAt the same time, official off-grid and behind-the-meter solar estimates fall far short of what import data suggest. This misalignment risks distorting tariff calculations, weakening demand-side management, and complicating grid operations.\nWithout clear methodology and public access to underlying data, policy decisions may be built on assumptions that do not reflect reality, leaving households, utilities, and planners exposed to unforeseen costs and operational stress.",

Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 1.4%, and MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.3%.\nTrump said he would impose additional 10% import levies from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, rising to 25% on June 1 if no deal is reached.\nMajor European Union states decried the tariff threats over Greenland as blackmail, and France proposed responding with a range of previously untested economic countermeasures.\nThe EU\u2019s options include a package of its own tariffs on 93 billion euros ($108 billion) of U.S. imports that was suspended for six months in early August and measures under an Anti-Coercion Instrument that could hit U.S. services trade or investments.\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank noted European countries owned $8 trillion of U.S. bonds and equities, almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined, and might consider bringing some of that money back home.\n\u201cWith the U.S. net international investment position at record negative extremes, the mutual interdependence of European-U.S. financial markets has never been higher,\u201d said George Saravelos, Deutsche\u2019s global head of FX research.\n\u201cIt is a weaponization of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets.\u201d\nIt should also make for a fraught few days at Davos as leaders from around the world gather at the World Economic Forum, including a large U.S. group led by Trump himself.\nDOLLAR NOT SO SAFE HAVEN\nChinese blue chips bucked the trend and rose 0.4% as data showed annual economic growth slowed to 4.5% in the December quarter, but still topped forecasts.\nIndustrial output also beat the market thanks to strength in exports, but a miss in retail sales underlined the continued weakness of domestic demand.\nThe Bank of Japan meets on Friday and, while no rate hike is expected this time, policymakers could flag a tightening as soon as April.\nOne added wrinkle is domestic politics given Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is expected to soon dissolve parliament to allow for an election in February.\nDelayed data on U.S. core inflation and consumption for November are due on Thursday and will refine investor expectations for when the Federal Reserve might cut again.\nA run of solid economic news at home has seen markets largely give up on an easing before June, with April priced at 65% for no change.\nEarnings season continues as banks are joined by a more diverse set of companies, including Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric and Intel.\nIn currency markets, the euro recovered from an early dip to rise 0.2% to $1.1620, while sterling clawed its way back up to $1.3387.\nThe dollar eased 0.4% against the Swiss franc to 0.7991 francs, and 0.2% against the yen to 157.77.\nThe cash Treasury market was shut, but 10-year futures firmed 1 tick. The 30-year contract actually fell 6 ticks as the risk of European selling loomed large.\nGold proved more of a safe harbour, rising 1.7% to $4,673 an ounce, while silver climbed 3% to $94.0.\nOil prices were flat, amid lingering concerns about a potential U.S. strike on Iran as a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier group was expected to arrive in the Persian Gulf this week.\nBrent was little changed at $64.19 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 0.1% to $59.52 per barrel.",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: Referring to a news item appearing in a section of press, Acting President Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Raza expressed serious concern and strong opposition to the proposed amendments to the Nepra Act, 1997 and the Electricity Act, 1910, which indicated that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) may be placed under the administrative control of the Power Division.\nMuhammad Raza stated that the proposed amendments effectively strike at the very foundation of regulatory independence, which is a universally accepted principle for ensuring transparency, predictability, and credibility in utility regulation.\nHe cautioned that placing Nepra under the direct influence of an executive ministry would compromise its ability to make impartial, technically sound, and cost-reflective decisions, thereby weakening confidence in Pakistan\u2019s power sector governance framework.\nHe pointed out that independent regulators are established precisely to act as neutral arbiters between the government, utilities, investors, and consumers.\nAny move that transforms Nepra into a subordinate body of the Power Division would not only undermine its authority but also raise serious concerns about politicisation of tariff determinations and regulatory decisions, which must remain insulated from short-term administrative or political pressures.\nHe warned that such amendments could severely damage investor confidence at a time when Pakistan desperately needs private sector participation to address chronic inefficiencies, mounting circular debt, and persistent capacity payment issues in the power sector.\nHe emphasised that investors require regulatory certainty and independence, and any perception of executive interference would deter fresh investment and increase the cost of capital for ongoing and future projects.\nMuhammad Raza further stated that weakening Nepra\u2019s autonomy would ultimately harm industrial and commercial consumers, who already face uncompetitive electricity tariffs and unreliable supply.\nAn independent regulator is essential to ensure fair scrutiny of costs, efficiency benchmarks, and service standards, whereas an administratively controlled regulator may be compelled to prioritise short-term fiscal or political considerations over long-term sector sustainability and consumer protection.\nHe also questioned the rationale behind the proposed amendments, noting that policy disagreements between a regulator and a ministry should be resolved through structured dialogue and institutional mechanisms, not by curtailing the regulator\u2019s independence.\nSuch an approach, he said, sets a dangerous precedent and reverses years of reform efforts aimed at strengthening governance and accountability in the power sector.\nRaza urged the government to immediately reconsider the proposed amendments and initiate comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders, including chambers of commerce, industry representatives, energy experts, and consumer bodies.\nHe stressed that Pakistan\u2019s economic revival depends on transparent, credible, and independent institutions, and that weakening Nepra would be a regressive step with long-term negative consequences for the economy.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019s industrial sector is being pushed to the brink by an unjust electricity pricing regime that forces industry to bankroll government failures in the power sector, Chairman of the Economic Policy and Business Development (EPBD) think tank and former caretaker federal minister Gohar Ejaz said on Tuesday.\nSpeaking in the context of the NEPRA tariff rebasing hearing, Ejaz highlighted that the power sector will require a staggering Rs 629 billion in subsidies, while the government has allocated only Rs 248 billion. The remaining gap, he said, is being unfairly bridged through cross-subsidisation, with industry bearing the heaviest burden.\nREAD MORE:Industrial, export-oriented consumers: Imposition of Rs130bn cross-subsidy opposed\n\u201cThis is nothing short of a hidden tax on industry,\u201d Ejaz said. \u201cThe government is not paying its share, so industry is being forced to subsidise other consumer categories. This has made Pakistani industry uncompetitive, both regionally and globally.\u201d\nAccording to Ejaz, if industrial consumers were charged purely on cost-of-service principles\u2014without cross-subsidies\u2014electricity tariffs for industry would be close to 9 US cents per unit even today, despite inefficiencies, governance failures, and systemic losses in the power sector.\nHe warned that persistently high energy prices are choking industrial activity, leading to plant shutdowns, declining exports, and job losses across the country.\n\u201cIt is the industrial sector that is subsidising other consumers on behalf of the government. This model is unsustainable.\u201d\nEjaz posed a stark question to policymakers: What happens when industry collapses?\n\u201cIf factories shut down, who will employ millions of industrial workers? Who will earn the foreign exchange needed to keep the economy afloat?\u201d he asked.\nHe stressed that cross-subsidy policies are economically destructive, eroding Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing base and accelerating de-industrialisation.\nREAD MORE:Public procurement: PPRA says has implemented reforms\nCalling for urgent reform, Ejaz urged the government to fully fund power sector subsidies transparently through the federal budget, end cross-subsidisation that penalises productive sectors, reduce inefficiencies and losses in distribution companies and align industrial energy tariffs with regional competitors.\n\u201cIndustry cannot and will not carry the power sector\u2019s burden any longer,\u201d Ejaz concluded. \u201cIf Pakistan is serious about growth, exports, and employment, it must stop treating industry as an endless source of revenue to cover policy failures.\u201d",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019 provincial revenue potential remains largely untapped, and claims that provinces have outperformed the federal government on tax collection do not stand up to a factual review, said Khurram Shehzad, Advisor to the Finance Minister.\n\u201cThe debate on fiscal federalism must be anchored in measured outcomes, not perceptions,\u201d Shehzad said, pointing to wide disparities between federal and provincial tax effort despite provinces holding major constitutionally assigned tax bases.\nHe shared details with media noting that in fiscal year 2025 the federal government collected over Rs 13 trillion, equivalent to 11.3 percent of GDP, placing Pakistan on a trajectory to reach the 15 percent federal tax-to-GDP benchmark by June 2028. For countries at Pakistan\u2019s level of development, total tax revenue of around 18 percent of GDP is considered normal, with the balance expected from provincial and state governments.\nBy contrast, all provinces combined collected just Rs 979 billion in fiscal year 2025, or 0.85 percent of GDP. \u201cProvinces are expected to contribute around 3 percent of GDP. To get there by 2028, collections will need to more than triple,\u201d Shehzad said.\nAccording to him, the core problem is not the absence of a tax base, but weak revenue yield from existing bases.\nOn sales tax, Shehzad highlighted that services \u2014 a provincial subject \u2014 have an estimated taxable base of Rs 29 trillion, yet provinces collected only Rs 650 billion, a yield of 2.2 percent. In contrast, sales tax on goods \u2014 a federal subject \u2014 generated Rs 3.9 trillion from a Rs 30 trillion base, a yield of around 13 percent.\n\u201cThis gap alone shows the difference in collection efficiency,\u201d he said.\nThe picture is even starker in agricultural income tax, also a provincial responsibility. Despite an estimated taxable base of Rs 3.7 trillion, provinces collected just Rs 8.4 billion, a yield of 0.2 percent.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019s GDP growth is projected to remain at 3 percent in fiscal year 2025\u201326 before rising to 3.4 percent in fiscal year 2026\u201327, driven by a recovery in agricultural production and reconstruction efforts following a series of floods in 2025, the World Bank said.\nHowever, Pakistan current account deficit is expected to widen in fiscal year 2026-27, with a rise in import demand, alongside the strengthening growth, and post-flood normalization of remittance inflows, the Bank stated in its latest report on Global Economic Prospects.\nThe Bank has also warned that in several oil importers, particularly Pakistan and Tunisia, further increases in US tariffs could lead to notable declines in exports. In addition, economies with a more concentrated export destination structure would be more vulnerable to trade related shocks.\nREAD MORE:Pakistan\u2019s exports as share of GDP shrinking: World Bank\nThe report further stated that in Morocco and Pakistan, the implementation of deeper-than-anticipated regulatory reforms to promote private sector activity could boost growth, reduce informality, and create jobs.\nIn Pakistan, a relaxation of import restrictions and an expansion of bank credit, stemming partly from easing financial conditions, have contributed to the strengthening of activity, particularly in the industrial sector.\nAmong oil importers, current account balances have improved in Morocco, Pakistan, and Tunisia, partly because of increases in remittances and tourism revenues, it added.\nAmong oil importers, inflation has declined, particularly on account of softening food prices. This has led to multiple policy rate cuts, including in Pakistan, though monetary policies have still remained restrictive to tame inflation in several economies, the Bank added.\nThe report noted that the global economy is proving more resilient than anticipated despite persistent trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Global growth is projected to remain broadly steady over the next two years, easing to 2.6% in 2026 before rising to 2.7% in 2027, an upward revision from the June forecast.\nThe resilience reflects better-than-expected growth\u2014especially in the United States, which accounts for about two-thirds of the upward revision to the forecast in 2026. Even so, if these forecasts hold, the 2020s are on track to be the weakest decade for global growth since the 1960s.\nThe sluggish pace is widening the gap in living standards across the world, the report finds: at the end of 2025, nearly all advanced economies enjoyed per capita incomes exceeding their 2019 levels, but about one in four developing economies had lower per capita incomes.\nIn 2025, growth was supported by a surge in trade ahead of policy changes and swift readjustments in global supply chains. These boosts are expected to fade in 2026 as trade and domestic demand soften.\nHowever, the easing global financial conditions and fiscal expansion in several large economies should help cushion the slowdown, according to the report. Global inflation is projected to edge down to 2.6% in 2026, reflecting softer labour markets and lower energy prices.\nGrowth is expected to pick up in 2027 as trade flows adjust and policy uncertainty diminishes.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "China\u2019s Five-Year Plans have long served as the backbone of its economic and social transformation. Since the launch of the first plan in 1953, these policy blueprints have guided the country from socialist industrialization to export-led growth and mass urbanization.\nUniquely, China remains the only major economy to have successfully completed every Five-Year Plan with broadly achieved objectives. As Beijing prepares for the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026\u20132030), the shift underway carries profound implications not only for China\u2019s future development but also for the global political economy.\nFor much of the reform era, particularly during the 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans, China pursued high-speed growth driven by heavy investment, industrial expansion, and exports. This model delivered extraordinary results, including sustained double-digit GDP growth and China\u2019s rise as the world\u2019s manufacturing hub.\nThe 13th Plan began acknowledging a \u201cnew normal\u201d of slower growth, yet quantitative expansion remained central. By the late 2010s, however, structural constraints\u2014overcapacity, environmental degradation, declining investment returns, demographic pressures, and intensifying geopolitical competition\u2014made a strategic recalibration unavoidable.\nThe turning point came with the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021\u20132025), which marked a decisive move away from growth at all costs. Notably, it avoided setting a rigid GDP growth target and instead elevated the concept of \u201chigh-quality development.\u201d\nInnovation, technological self-reliance, environmental sustainability, and social equity replaced sheer expansion as policy priorities. The emphasis on supply-chain security and the \u201cdual circulation\u201d strategy reflected China\u2019s response to global uncertainty and external pressures.\nThe forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan builds on this transformation. Covering the period from 2026 to 2030, it represents a critical phase in China\u2019s long-term goal of basically achieving socialist modernization by 2035. The plan is expected to consolidate China\u2019s shift toward an innovation-led, resilient, and people-centered economy, focusing on quality rather than speed of growth.\nTechnological self-reliance will be a central pillar. China aims to strengthen indigenous innovation in strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum technology, bio manufacturing, hydrogen energy, and space industries. This drive is designed to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and foreign restrictions, but it also has global implications, particularly as technological competition with Western economies intensifies.\nEqually significant is the plan\u2019s strong commitment to green development. China has already emerged as the world\u2019s largest investor in renewable energy, accounting for a substantial share of global solar and wind capacity additions. The 15th Plan is expected to further integrate ecological protection, clean energy, and low-carbon industrial systems into economic planning, aligning growth with climate responsibility.\nSocial modernization is another defining feature. Building on the vision of \u201ccommon prosperity,\u201d the plan emphasizes rural revitalisation, urban renewal, demographic resilience, and improved social welfare. By strengthening domestic consumption and reducing regional disparities, China seeks to create a more balanced and inclusive development model.\nBeyond its domestic agenda, the 15th Five-Year Plan carries wide international significance. It reinforces China\u2019s intention to remain engaged with the global economy while reshaping globalisation through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development, Security, Civilisation, and Governance Initiatives.\nFor developing regions in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa, the plan signals a shift toward higher quality, sustainable, and innovation-oriented cooperation.\nFor countries like Pakistan, this presents both opportunities and challenges. Chinese investment can support infrastructure development, industrial upgrading, and energy transition. At the same time, it underscores the need for careful policy choices to ensure economic sustainability, strategic balance, and long-term national interests.\nUltimately, China\u2019s 15th Five-Year Plan symbolizes a historic transition\u2014from rapid catch-up growth to qualitative, innovation-driven, and environmentally conscious modernization. Its success will shape not only China\u2019s internal resilience and technological leadership but also the future contours of global trade, innovation, and development. As such, the plan deserves close attention well beyond China\u2019s borders.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nDr Zafaruddin Mahmood\nThe writer has served as Pakistan\u2019s first Consul General, at Shanghai and speaks fluent Mandarin.

Deep-rooted policy and institutional weaknesses\u2014marked by excessive controls, subsidies, taxes, trade protection, and the dominant role of SOEs \u2014 have suppressed productivity, investment, and export competitiveness.\nAs a result, private investment remains stuck at around 10 percent of GDP, far below 20\u201325 percent in India and Bangladesh, while exports have declined from 16 percent of GDP in the 1990s to about 10 percent today.\nThe WBG aims to tackle these structural constraints by supporting a shift toward a more open, export-led growth model. With an estimated additional $60 billion in annual export potential, realizing this opportunity will depend on decisive improvements in the business environment.\nThe World Bank team briefed the Finance Minister on the progress of ongoing operations and projects under the CPF, including recent developments in fiscal and revenue reforms, macroeconomic stabilisation efforts, and policy-based engagements.\nBoth sides acknowledged that Pakistan has made progress toward macroeconomic stability through prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and emphasized the need to translate this stability into sustained economic growth, higher investment, and job creation.\nThe discussion focused on designing a coherent, programmatic investment framework aligned with CPF objectives, covering business environment reforms, state-owned enterprise reforms, trade facilitation, capital market development, and export competitiveness.\nAurangzeb underscored the government\u2019s commitment to structural reforms already underway, including tariff rationalisation, improved SOE governance, regulatory modernisation, and transparency initiatives.\nHe also emphasized the importance of deepening capital markets, expanding access to long-term finance, and strengthening institutional coordination to support private sector\u2013led growth.\nThe meeting also discussed employment and skills development as a critical pillar of economic growth.\nThe Finance Minister highlighted the need for market-driven vocational and technical training, closer public-private collaboration, and alignment of skills development with domestic and overseas labour market demand, particularly in sectors such as IT, healthcare, nursing, hospitality, and construction.\nThe World Bank shared its ongoing work on labour mobility, skills matching, and digital labour market platforms to enhance workforce productivity and overseas employment opportunities.\nSectoral priorities including digital services exports, agriculture and agribusiness, minerals and mining, healthcare, and selected manufacturing segments were also discussed as potential focus areas for future World Bank-supported operations.

Shrimps and prawns followed with earnings of $40.46 million, while frozen cuttlefish generated $36.13 million.\nOther products, including shrimp meal, crabs, sardines, mackerel, flatfish species, and fish meal, also contributed to higher export receipts, underscoring diversification and growth in value-added processing.\nChina retained its position as Pakistan\u2019s largest export destination, importing more than 83,602 metric tons worth $149.2 million, i.e. nearly 59% of total seafood exports, driven by steady demand for high-quality frozen products.\nThailand ranked second with imports valued at $31.3 million, mainly shrimps and prawns, supported by Pakistan\u2019s HACCP-certified processing standards.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), Malaysia, and Japan followed, with rising shipments of cuttlefish and fish meal.\nThe minister added that market diversification efforts have also expanded exports to the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Kuwait, and the United States.\nMonthly export figures showed consistent growth, peaking at $56.42 million in November and $55 million in December, aided by seasonal demand and logistical improvements. Non-tax revenue from the fisheries sectors also increased to Rs127.7 million (approximately $460,000), up from Rs118 million in 2025.\nREAD MORE:Seafood exports to EU states unlikely to resume next year\nChaudhry attributed the gains to government initiatives under the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, including collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on sustainable fishing practices and investments in port infrastructure at Karachi and Gwadar.\n\u201cThese developments signal the fisheries sector\u2019s rising contribution to foreign exchange earnings and economic stability,\u201d he said, while stressing the need for strict regulatory compliance and sustainable fishing to protect marine biodiversity.\nHe acknowledged ongoing challenges such as climate-related impacts on migratory species, but noted that emerging tools like eDNA monitoring and broader blue economy strategies are gaining momentum as Pakistan aligns with IMO conventions and strengthens regional cooperation.",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal announced the imposition of an \u201cExport Emergency\u201d in the country entailing the creation of a special cell in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to address problems and constraints facing the business community on an urgent basis with the objective of increasing exports by 40 percent in four years and 200 percent by 2035.\nHis statement reflects an awareness of a decline in exports leading to a rise in the trade deficit during the first half of the current year against the same period the year before \u2014 negative USD 19,204 million as opposed to negative USD 14,271 million \u2014 which implies that the reliance on foreign borrowing, including rollovers from friendly countries, borrowing from bilaterals and multilaterals, to shore up foreign exchange reserves continues unabated.\nAwareness of a problem is the first step towards its resolution and requires sector experts/stakeholders to delve into the causes of the problem and formulate a set of remedial measures designed to resolve it in the short, medium and ideally long term.\nThere is a plethora of empirical research gathering dust in government offices that highlights the reasons behind Pakistan\u2019s cyclical economic volatility.\nThe October 2024 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report titled Request for an Extended Fund Arrangement reiterated the crux of the problem notably \u201ceconomic volatility has only increased over time, with a tight correlation between Pakistan\u2019s boom-bust economic outcomes and its macroeconomic policies.\u201d The report, disturbingly, added that \u201ccompared to nine other regional peers, the country\u2019s export growth since 2000 has been second to last, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.\nREAD MORE:BR RESEARCH: Pakistan\u2019s export performance: the emergency reflex\nThe country\u2019s trade restrictions (including exchange measures, tariff and non-tariff barriers, restrictions to payments, etc.) have placed it consistently at or around the 90th percentile of the highest Measurement of Aggregate Trade Restrictions index\u2026. This high level of protection has not helped improve, and likely undermined, Pakistan\u2019s competitiveness.\u201d One can only hope that the export emergency cell would take cognizance of these observations and not repeat past mistakes which have been to extend monetary and fiscal subsidies to specific influential sectors with the objective of increasing exports, which would reactivate the boom-bust syndrome.\nWhile setting up an export emergency cell in the PM Office indicates that that the government has elevated it at the highest executive level, thereby facilitating appropriate policy decisions promptly, there is a need to carefully review the pledges made by the economic team leaders to the Fund \u2014 pledges that if not met may not only lead to a cessation of the next tranche release but as has been evident since 2019 may lead to the three friendly countries refusing to roll over 12 billion dollars to another year.\nThe Fund\u2019s advice is implicit in its observation: \u201cwith an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles, the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products. Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors.\u201d In other words, structural reforms are required that do not consist of monetary or fiscal incentives or setting up special economic zones, that the government has pledged to phase out and not announce any new ones but to end all existing economic distortions.\nIf past precedence is anything to go by an \u2018export emergency cell\u2019 will undertake measures that would bring it in conflict with pledges made to the IMF. To increase our leverage with the Fund would require taking measures that would be supported by the Fund and include ending the energy cross-subsidy paid for by industry, reducing current expenditure to create fiscal space that would ease the vise-like application of the Federal Board of Revenue\u2019s audit function being described as harassment by industry, end red tape implicit in any new venture and end the elite capture of both budgeted resources as well as outlay.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "We enter the New Year not with renewal, but with remembrance \u2013 remembrance of the same problems, the same pains, the same untold miseries that have stalked this land for decades. Time has moved forward, calendars have changed, and digits have been replaced, yet nothing fundamental has changed in the lived reality of the people. We transport ourselves into the New Year carrying all our past baggage \u2013 old wounds, festering injustices, and unfulfilled promises \u2013 still crying out for improvement, reforms, good governance, an end to cancerous corruption, and relief from elite capture that continues to destroy the very fabric of our society.\nThe illusion of change collapses when confronted with facts.\nOur rulers peddle an official unemployment rate of around 7 percent, projecting an image of relative stability. Yet renowned and independent economists place real unemployment closer to 22 percent, exposing a massive gap between official narratives and lived reality. Each year, over 22 million young people enter the labour force, hopeful yet increasingly disillusioned, only to find shrinking opportunities and closed doors. This youth bulge, instead of becoming a demographic dividend, is fast turning into a social and economic time bomb.\nHunger, meanwhile, stalks millions. More than 8 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, unsure where their next meal will come from. Among children, the crisis is even more heartbreaking. Around 38 percent suffer from stunted growth, a permanent scar of malnutrition that impairs physical and cognitive development. These are not mere statistics; they are lifelong sentences imposed on innocence.\nEducation \u2013 the most powerful instrument of social mobility \u2013 stands in ruins. Shamefully, Pakistan has one of the lowest literacy rates in South Asia. Over 25 million children are out of school, while the Pakistan Institute of Education reports that around 20 million children have never attended school at all. Millions of these children, instead of spending their formative years learning, playing, and dreaming, are forced into garages, hotels, workshops, shops, and menial labour to support families crushed by poverty. Their stolen childhoods are the most damning indictment of our governance failures.\nHealthcare paints an equally grim picture. Our health system is overwhelmed and under-resourced, struggling to cope with both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Public hospitals are massively flooded with ailing souls, lacking beds, medicines, equipment, and trained staff. The poor village women carrying the emaciated babies in their laps roam from pillar to post for the scarce medicines and absentee doctors. For the poor and have-nots, illness often becomes a death sentence or a descent into irreversible debt. Preventive healthcare remains neglected, while private care is prohibitively expensive, pushing medical treatment beyond the reach of the common citizen. The common man \u2013 the very soul and architect of Pakistan \u2013 remains trapped in a cycle of poverty, injustice and betrayal.\nInfrastructure, the backbone of any functional state, is crippling and collapsing. Vast segments of the population still lack proper sanitation and sewage systems, living amid filth that breeds disease and indignity. Roads crumble, water systems fail, electricity remains unreliable, and urban planning is almost non-existent. These failures are not accidents; they are the result of years of neglect, corruption, and misplaced priorities.\nJustice, too, remains elusive. Cases crawl through courts for years, even decades, making justice expensive, exhausting, and inaccessible for ordinary citizens. The poor suffer delays; the powerful exploit loopholes. At the grassroots, our police stations \u2013 the thanas \u2013 are often governed not by law, but by connections and currency, further eroding public trust in the state.\nInflation continues to perish and break the bones of the people, relentlessly eroding purchasing power and dignity. Even as official figures fluctuate, the cost of food, fuel, utilities, and basic necessities keeps ordinary families in a permanent state of anxiety. Survival itself has become a daily struggle.\nAnd towering over all these crises is the mountain of debt. Better not to speak of it \u2013 yet we must. Billions are borrowed annually to build infrastructure and improve the lot of commoners \u2013 yet the lives of multitudes remain untouched by progress. Flood water turns towns and cities into lakes, yet the state services are visibly absent. Pakistan today stands drowning in debt of around Rs. 80.6 trillion, translating into a burden of approximately Rs. 318,252 on every citizen. Each passing day adds to these fetters, tightening the noose around the nation\u2019s economic sovereignty. Debt servicing consumes resources that should have built schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, while wasteful administration and discretionary expenditures show no signs of austerity or restraint.\nMost painfully, our public representatives, intoxicated by rhetoric, continue to raise their perks and privileges, even as they sermonize about reforms, good governance, ending elite capture, and curing the monster of corruption. The contradiction is glaring, the hypocrisy staggering. Why are we still here with birthday problems? Nations that rose from ashes \u2013 Germany, Japan, South Korea \u2013 stand as titans. Even Bangladesh once poorer out spaces us in growth. Let them think today to steer us out of crises and transport us to new year with new resolve and commitment to alleviate our suffering and festering problems of past years.\nIn such circumstances, we have little to cherish as we step into the New Year. We enter it with old stories, old scars, and a mountain of unresolved crises. Yet, despite everything, the people do not surrender hope. They carry a fragile but persistent optimism \u2013 the belief that the New Year might finally bring departure from destructive past practices and a genuine turn toward reform.\nWhat the people seek is not charity, but justice. Not slogans, but structural change. They yearn for real efforts by those in power to pull the country out of debilitating poverty, staggering unemployment, crippling inflation, and drowning debt. They aspire to a future with quality education, decent employment, functioning healthcare, resilient infrastructure, better law and order, and above all, dignity, honour, and respect \u2013 the hallmarks of a civilized, independent, and honourable nation.\nOnly then will a New Year carry true fragrance \u2013 not merely of a changed digit, but of changed lives. Only then will the promise of a new horizon cease to be poetic rhetoric and become lived reality. Until that day, the people will continue to step into each New Year burdened, bruised, yet unbroken \u2013 still hoping that time will one day move not just forward, but towards justice.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nQamer Soomro\nThe writer is a Shikarpur-based retired civil servant.

These include banquet halls, catering services, ready-made garments, as well as transportation costs. In 2025 there were more daytime wedding events than in the past five years. Other reasons include better weather and the fact that children are on holidays from school. The concept of wedding event management is rapidly gaining ground.",
      "fullText": "The marriage industry has evolved into a key economic contributor in Pakistan, generating nearly Rs33 billion during this winter seasonin economic activity from weddings held in Karachi alone, according to one estimate.\nThis figure represents only the direct industries associated with wedding ceremonies, which include banquet halls, catering services, ready-made garments, as well as transportation costs.\nIt has been obtained through calculation: the total number of banquets in Karachi are about 800, and the occupancy rate was 70%. This means that 560 weddings took place in one day. If we multiply 560 by 60, the number comes out to be 33,600. Since 600 halls are located in middle-class or lower-middle-class localities, the average expense per wedding has been figure out Rs1million. In this way, the total amount comes to around Rs33 billion.\nAccording to Rana Rais Ahmed, president of the All Karachi Marriage Hall Lawn Banquet Owner Association, the number of direct industries involved in wedding ceremonies ranges from 80 to 100, while the number of allied industries is approximately 250, including the construction industry.\n\u201cAlthough a wedding appears to be just an event, there are around 250 industries associated with it. Direct industries include catering, flowers, banquets, and men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, while indirect industries also include the construction sector, because before weddings people often renovate or build\u201d Ahmed said.\nWhile speaking toBusiness Recorder, the president said from March 2025 until around November, the wedding season was almost negligible. However, the season performed well in December and January, with hall occupancy reaching up to 70%.\nHe explained that until a few years ago, people scheduled weddings according to the Islamic calendar, but now the trend has changed. There is a preference for winter months for several reasons. In the 1980s and 1990s there were very few Pakistani families living abroad, but now their number has increased significantly, and they return to Pakistan during the December-January holidays. Other reasons include better weather and the fact that children are on holidays from school.When asked about the growing trend of daytime weddings in Karachi, the president said that the main reason is that halls can cost up to 50% less and are more easily available. In 2025 there were more daytime wedding events than in the past five years.\nKarachi has a total of 800 halls, about 600 of which are located in Orangi, Korangi, Surjani, PIB Colony, and surrounding areas. The remaining hubs are situated along Shahrah-e-Faisal, Bahadurabad, Gulistan-e-Jauhar, and Sakhi Hassan, according to Ahmed.\nHe also said the concept of wedding event management is rapidly gaining ground, gradually replacing traditional methods of organizing marriages. This growing trend reflects changing social preferences, time constraints, and a desire for more personalized and well-organised wedding experiences.\nIzzah Zaman, the CEO of event planning marketplaceShadiyana, toldBusiness Recorderdemand for services is spread fairly evenly across income groups.Between October and December 2025, event management companies recorded an almost 25% increase in desktop-based queries, indicating that users are taking time to research vendors, pricing, and availability - a sign that event planning behaviour is evolving.\nZaman has noticed a reduction in average guest counts. She said currently the average guest counts during the December\u2013January wedding season stood at approximately 249, with a noticeable preference for more intimate and personalized events.\n\u201cHowever, this shift does not necessarily translate into lower overall wedding spending. In many cases, spending is being reallocated towards experience, quality, and personalization. Given this nuance, it would be difficult to make a definitive claim that wedding budgets have reduced overall\u201d, the CEO said.",

      "fullText": "WASHINGTON: Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said on Friday she was confident that the remnants of what she called Venezuela\u2019s \u201ccriminal regime\u201d would eventually be dismantled and there would be an orderly transition to free elections, but cautioned that the road ahead would be difficult and complex.\nMachado spoke to reporters a day after meeting President Donald Trump at the White House, where she presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to him as she sought to sway him to give the opposition a role in determining Venezuela\u2019s future after the U.S. ousted longtime leader Nicolas Maduro.\nTrump has backed former Maduro loyalists, led by interim President Delcy Rodriguez, to govern the OPEC nation for now instead of Machado, whose movement was widely seen as the legitimate winner of the 2024 election that Maduro was accused of rigging.\nCONFIDENT OF ORDERLY MOVE TO ELECTIONS\nSince the January 3 lightning raid that toppled Maduro, Trump has prioritized gaining access to Venezuela\u2019s vast oil reserves, not restoring democracy to Venezuela, and made clear he sees the current leadership as the best bet for maintaining order.\nMachado\u2019s visit to Washington has done little to clarify any role she may have in the changes under way in Venezuela. She said she insisted in her meeting with Trump on returning to Venezuela as soon as possible, but cited no tangible agreements with the U.S.\nVenezuela acting president, opposition leader navigate new relations with Trump administration\nDespite signs of the Trump administration deepening ties with Maduro\u2019s government, Machado gave a mostly upbeat assessment.\n\u201cI am profoundly, profoundly confident that we will have an orderly transition (to elections),\u201d she told a press conference, but stressed that the process would take time to unfold.\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with tension or relations between Delcy Rodriguez and myself,\u201d she said, but insisted that a \u201ccriminal structure\u201d that has dominated Venezuela for years would eventually dismantle itself. She did not elaborate on how this would happen.\nMachado branded Venezuela\u2019s new leader a \u201ccommunist\u201d and said Rodriguez is afraid of Trump and holds an unsustainable position as head of a system that is \u201crepressive\u201d but does not include the military.\nRodriguez\u2019s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCIA DIRECTOR MEETS RODRIGUEZ\nCoinciding with Machado\u2019s White House visit on Thursday, CIA Director John Ratcliffe flew to Caracas, the highest-level known U.S. visit since the toppling of Maduro and another sign of the two sides jockeying for favor with the Trump administration. In a photo circulating on social media, the two shook hands surrounded by several people, with Rodriguez wearing a bright green pantsuit and sneakers.\nTrump to host Venezuelan opposition leader sidelined by US\nMachado expressed gratitude to Trump and avoided any direct criticism of his approach to post-Maduro Venezuela, which has frustrated many in the country\u2019s opposition.\nTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Machado was a \u201cwonderful woman who has been through so much\u201d and that giving him her Nobel Peace Prize medal was \u201ca wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\u201d The White House later posted a photo of Trump, alongside Machado, holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.\nSEEKING TRUMP\u2019S FAVOR\nMachado\u2019s attempt to win Trump\u2019s favor in their first face-to-face meeting came after he dismissed the idea of installing her as Venezuela\u2019s leader to replace Maduro, who was whisked away to New York to face prosecution on \u201cnarco-trafficking\u201d charges.\nDuring the visit, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump stood by his \u201crealistic\u201d assessment that Machado did not currently have the support needed to lead the country in the short term.\nWhile declining to offer details of her discussions with Trump, Machado acknowledged \u201cthere may be some phase that we hadn\u2019t anticipated or that we don\u2019t like.\u201d But she asserted that the opposition was participating in Venezuela\u2019s transition, without offering specifics.\nMachado, who fled the South American nation in a daring seaborne escape in December, is competing for Trump\u2019s ear with members of Venezuela\u2019s government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.\nTrump says no more Venezuelan oil, money to go to Cuba\nTrump has on several occasions praised Rodriguez, Maduro\u2019s former vice president, and told Reuters on Wednesday, \u201cShe\u2019s been very good to deal with.\u201d\nRatcliffe met with Rodriguez at Trump\u2019s direction \u201cto deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship,\u201d according to a U.S. official.\nThe two discussed intelligence cooperation, economic stability and the need to ensure Venezuela was no longer a \u201csafe haven for America\u2019s adversaries, especially narco-traffickers,\u201d according to the U.S. official.\nMachado was banned from running in Venezuela\u2019s 2024 presidential election by a top court stacked with Maduro allies, and went into hiding.\nOutside observers widely believe Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition figure backed by Machado, won by a substantial margin, but Maduro claimed victory.\nMany Machado and Gonzalez allies were jailed in the fallout of the election, with rights group Foro Penal estimating about 800 political prisoners in the country. Among them is Rafael Tudares, the husband of Gonzalez\u2019s daughter Mariana Gonzalez, who was detained in January 2025. Mariana Gonzalez said on Friday that authorities allowed her to speak with Tudares for 25 minutes through a panel of bulletproof glass, and she found him in poor health.\n\u201cRafael was visibly affected, both physically and emotionally,\u201d she said in a social media post. \u201cIsolation and being kept away from his children are not human conditions for anyone.\u201d\nIn an annual address to lawmakers on Thursday, Rodriguez called for diplomacy with the United States and said that should she need to travel to Washington, she would do so \u201cwalking on her feet, not dragged there.\u201d\nShe also said she would propose reforms to her country\u2019s oil industry aimed at increasing access for foreign investors. The potential shift comes as international oil companies are lobbying for changes in Venezuelan law that would give them the right to freely export oil produced in the country.",

Its southeastern sandy beach offers strong potential for hospitality, recreation and leisure activities, the minister said.\n\u201cThe natural beauty and coastal environment of Ziarat Hasan Shah Island present a unique opportunity to create a high-value recreational hub that aligns with Pakistan\u2019s growing coastal tourism demand,\u201d Chaudhry added.\nAfter PIA, Arif Habib sets sights on \u2018blue economy\u2019\nAs per the ministry, unlike other offshore developments, the island is accessible by land, allowing a direct road connection to Karachi\u2019s existing road network. This accessibility would help reduce infrastructure costs and speed up development, while also encouraging local employment and business activity, the minister noted.\nAccording to the ministry, the project will be implemented under a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) or Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, with the government seeking private investors with experience in hospitality, tourism and leisure development.\n\u201cWe aim to attract credible partners while ensuring public interests are protected, and returns remain sustainable,\u201d said Chaudhry.\nPakistan has more than 1,000 kilometres of coastline, much of it underutilised, and the government is seeking to position the maritime sector as a key driver of economic growth.\nThe island project is part of broader port-led and coastal initiatives intended to expand trade, tourism and investment as Pakistan seeks to strengthen its blue economy.",

India also has extensive defence ties with Russia.\nThat said, foreign equity inflows into India\u2019s defence sector have been muted, accounting for $26.5 million of total foreign inflows of $765 billion in the 25 years through September 2025, according to government data.\nIndia has sought to bolster funding for the defence sector following a short but deadly conflict with arch-rival Pakistan last May, in which drones and fighter jets took centre stage.\nThe defence ministry is asking for a 20% increase in spending in the budget for fiscal 2026/27 over the $75.36 billion allotted for the current year. Last year, the government also said it aimed to nearly double domestic production of defence equipment to $33.25 billion and boost defence exports to $5.5 billion by 2029.\nDefence exports grew 12% year-on-year in 2024/25 to $2.6 billion - a record high as India seeks to shed its long-standing status as one of the world\u2019s largest arms importers.",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) was asked to keep in mind 27th Constitutional Amendment and other factors while delivering judgement on Super Tax under Sections 4B and 4C.\nA three-member bench, headed by the Chief Justice Amin, on Wednesday heard the FBR appeals against the judgements of Sindh, Lahore and Islamabad High Courts regarding levy of Super Tax under Section 4C, inserted in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 through Finance Act 2015.\nFarough Naseem, representing Karachi based taxpayers, said both the sides, particularly the FCC, would have to maintain the balance, in passing the judgement on the FBR appeals regarding levy of Super Tax under Sections 4B and 4C.\nREAD MORE:Super tax levy only under single tax regime, FCC told\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t unsettle the settled provisions. This is not in anyone\u2019s interest to unsettle the settled law.\u201d\nHe warned the bench that; \u201cIf you disturb the settled provisions then there will be judicial chaos,\u201d adding the provisions of law are always prospective.\nHe further argued that the Federal Constitutional Court can\u2019t ignore 75 years\u2019 jurisprudence of Pakistan, adding if it (FCC) would do that then there would be judicial havoc. He further said that the Courts never bulldoze the past judgements, and hoped that the FCC would not bulldoze the 75 years\u2019 jurisprudence.\nFarough stated that if the Court would allow the Parliament to legislate law with retrospective effect, then there will be horrible consequences for the economic activity in the country.\nHe argued that the FCC is hearing the appeals against the judgements of the High Courts, which were passed in accordance with the law that was prevalent before the 27th Constitutional Amendment. He stated therefore the Court now has to see whether those judgements were correct according to the law of that time.\nHe contended that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) would have to establish that the judgements, passed by the High Courts (SHC, LHC & IHC) according to the laws of that time, were wrong. He stated that the FCC three-member is handicapped to examine the judgements delivered by the larger bench of the Supreme Court. If the FCC wants to do that then it would not be appropriate, he cautioned the bench.\nFarough stated that the FBR\u2019s claim that the Super Tax was imposed on individuals and the companies earning more than Rs 500 million was due to shortage of money, adding the FBR\u2019s this policy would create chaos, as not only the foreign investors would move their businesses out of the country, but those companies who pay huge taxes would also run away. He suggested that the FBR has other means to generate funds.\nHe said General Ziaul Haq had imposed Martial Law which somehow was successful, but the Martial Law of Pervez Musharraf failed because he did not consider other factors.\nFarough argued that though it cannot be said that the Supreme Court of Pakistan judgements are binding on the FCC. However, the FCC needs to keep in mind that those judgements were delivered by the highest court of the country before the 27th Amendment. His emphasis was that the High Courts had rightly set aside the Sections 4B and 4C in accordance with the law prevalent at that time.\nThe case was adjourned until Thursday (today).\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019 provincial revenue potential remains largely untapped, and claims that provinces have outperformed the federal government on tax collection do not stand up to a factual review, said Khurram Shehzad, Advisor to the Finance Minister.\n\u201cThe debate on fiscal federalism must be anchored in measured outcomes, not perceptions,\u201d Shehzad said, pointing to wide disparities between federal and provincial tax effort despite provinces holding major constitutionally assigned tax bases.\nHe shared details with media noting that in fiscal year 2025 the federal government collected over Rs 13 trillion, equivalent to 11.3 percent of GDP, placing Pakistan on a trajectory to reach the 15 percent federal tax-to-GDP benchmark by June 2028. For countries at Pakistan\u2019s level of development, total tax revenue of around 18 percent of GDP is considered normal, with the balance expected from provincial and state governments.\nBy contrast, all provinces combined collected just Rs 979 billion in fiscal year 2025, or 0.85 percent of GDP. \u201cProvinces are expected to contribute around 3 percent of GDP. To get there by 2028, collections will need to more than triple,\u201d Shehzad said.\nAccording to him, the core problem is not the absence of a tax base, but weak revenue yield from existing bases.\nOn sales tax, Shehzad highlighted that services \u2014 a provincial subject \u2014 have an estimated taxable base of Rs 29 trillion, yet provinces collected only Rs 650 billion, a yield of 2.2 percent. In contrast, sales tax on goods \u2014 a federal subject \u2014 generated Rs 3.9 trillion from a Rs 30 trillion base, a yield of around 13 percent.\n\u201cThis gap alone shows the difference in collection efficiency,\u201d he said.\nThe picture is even starker in agricultural income tax, also a provincial responsibility. Despite an estimated taxable base of Rs 3.7 trillion, provinces collected just Rs 8.4 billion, a yield of 0.2 percent.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "Pakistan is the 5th most populous country having 64 percent of its population under the age of 30. It is often being pitched as a land of opportunities. However, despite an expanding market, a youthful workforce and strategic location, the country has not been able to attract enough investment, whether domestic and foreign.\nA lot of literature has highlighted various economic issues as the main culprits like interest rate, exchange rate, inflation, low economic growth, etc. but, there are some other issues, which are affecting investment adversely in the country. When other countries are moving upward, Pakistan\u2019s investment is sliding downward.\nBack in 1975, the investment to GDP ratio of Pakistan was approximately 17 percent. After 50 years, it has decreased to 13.1 percent, which is a serious concern and needs proper pondering of policy makers.\nBeside weak domestic investment, the country\u2019s performance of attracting FDI is also lackluster. Back in 1990s, Pakistan used to attract more FDIs than India, but the equation has flipped completely. For example, in 1992, Pakistan attracted USD 336.5 million in FDI, while India attracted only USD 276.5 million. Now the trajectory has completely changed; in 2024, Pakistan only managed USD 2.7 billion, while India attracted USD 27.1 billion, which is almost 13 times higher.\nIn 2022, India attracted USD 50 billion FDI, while Pakistan has just USD 1.46 billion. Why has this huge divergence occurred? Various initiatives were taken like the Board of Investment, One Window Operation, and most recently the establishment of SIFC, but to no avail. Simply, policies are not feasible to attract the investors.\nFor instance, take the corporate tax rate, which is extremely high and can reach 65 percent. An investor wants profit, not punishment for investing. The standard corporate base rate is 29 percent and reaches up to 44 percent for some sectors. Then there are 10 percent super tax, 2 percent worker welfare fund, and 5 percent worker participation fund, summing up to 50 percent.\nAlso add 15 percent income tax of the dividends; the tax rate reaches 65 percent. Why on the earth will someone invest with such a higher tax rate? Why an investor will not invest in Dubai where the corporate tax rate is only 9 percent when income is above a threshold otherwise 0 percent tax? However, this seems a small problem as compared to the other issues, which are discouraging investors.\nThe security situation is one of them. It has not improved for decades. The country ranked second on the Global Terrorism Index and the attacks are not receding. How is one supposed to invest in such situation? Even domestic investors have shifted their capital to safe havens.\nSimilarly, the law and order situation in the country is also forcing investors to move to safer avenues.\nPolitical instability is another major hurdle. Political parties are after one another driven by vendetta and not by national interest. There is no long-term political vision for the betterment of the country.\nCitizens witness strikes, lockdowns and closure of main roads for weeks, affecting businesses adversely. In developed democracies, there are consistencies of policy regardless whichever party is in the government. Regrettably, the case is different in Pakistan.\nLikewise, regulatory burdens and red tape are another nightmare. Instead of facilitation, regulations are often used as a tool of control. Compliance is very time consuming. If someone wants to install an electricity or gas connection, he has to wait for months. If one wants faster service, then one has to grease the palm of the authorities.\nSimilarly, opening a bank account is a herculean task, providing endless documents like utility bills, proof of income and so on. Company registration takes even more long and hectic documentation. Why would someone put his hard earned money in a process full of hurdles? On top of that, repatriating money or profit is also a struggle.\nThe weak judicial system is often ignored while discussing the investment issue. A strong judicial system provides confidence to investors that his interest cannot be harmed by anyone. Pakistan judicial system is ranked 129 out of 142 on the World Justice Project. There is no quick mechanism for dispute resolution.\nThe courts are overburdened and inefficient having more than 2.3 million backlog of cases. A commercial dispute takes years and sometime even decades. If someone wants to trouble you, he will just file a fabricated case and it will take years to prove that there is nothing substantial behind it.\nFor many domestic investors, the fear of political victimization combined with the lack of judicial protection discourages them to invest.\nThen there are issues of infrastructure and policy inconsistency. Investors face electricity and power outages along with very high cost. To cope, many businesses have installed solar for power generation and every year there is a debate to tax their own generation.\nThe lack of policy inconsistency makes the situation further exacerbated. Many investors fear that today\u2019s rules will not survive the next budget. In such unpredictability, no one is ready to invest in the country.\nTo cut the long story short, if Pakistan wants high investment, it has to make some amends. Otherwise, increasing investment will be a far cry in the wilderness.\nPakistan must address its governance problem, improve its law and order situation, strengthen its judicial system, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, improve policy consistency and cool down the political temperature. Then it will boost the morale of investors to invest in the country. Instead of higher taxes, the country needs to incentivize investors so that productivity can rise. Without transparent tax system, regulatory regime, protection of rights, contract enforcement, sustainable macro policy and reliable infrastructure, Pakistan will be bypassed by the serious investors.\nThe country cannot afford the outflow of investors like the recent exit of Procter & Gamble (P&G), Shell, Telenor, Pfizer, Bayer, Total Energies, Uber, Careem, and Microsoft.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nWajid Islam\nThe writer is a Research Economist at the Pakistan institute of development economics (PIDE), Islamabad.

      "fullText": "TAHIR AMINISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered Pakistan\u2019s economic growth outlook, cutting its GDP projection for the current fiscal year to 3.2 percent, down from 3.6 percent estimated in its October 2025 World Economic Outlook.The Fund in its latest report \u201cWorld Economic Outlook 2026 update, global economy: steady amid divergent forces\u201d, estimated Pakistan\u2019 GDP growth at three percent in 2025, which is projected to grow to 3.2 percent in the outgoing fiscal year 2026 and 4.1 percent in 2027.World Bank has projected Pakistan GDP growth to remain at three percent in fiscal year 2025\u201326 before rising to 3.4 percent in fiscal year 2026\u201327.The National Accounts Committee (NAC) has approved the updated growth of GDP during fiscal year 2024-25 at 3.09 percent. The Committee further estimated that economy has posted a growth of 3.71 percent during first quarter (Q1) of fiscal year 2025-26.The Fund stated that global growth is projected to remain resilient at 3.3 percent in 2026 and at 3.2 percent in 2027: rates similar to the estimated 3.3 percent outturn in 2025. The forecast marks a small upward revision for 2026 and no change for 2027 compared with that in the October 2025 WEO. This steady performance on the surface results from the balancing of divergent forces. Headwinds from shifting trade policies are offset by tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), more so in North America and Asia than in other regions, as well as fiscal and monetary support, broadly accommodative financial conditions, and adaptability of the private sector.Global headline inflation is expected to decline from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2025 to 3.8 percent in 2026 and further to 3.4 percent in 2027. The inflation projections are also broadly unchanged from those in October and envisage inflation returning to target more gradually in the United States than in other large economies.Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. Re-evaluation of productivity growth expectations about AI could lead to a decline in investment and trigger an abrupt financial market correction, spreading from AI-linked companies to other segments and eroding household wealth. Trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity. Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices. Larger fiscal deficits and high public debt could put pressure on long-term interest rates and, in turn, on broader financial conditions. On the upside, activity could be further lifted by AI-related investment and eventually transform into sustainable growth if faster AI adoption translates into strong productivity gains and increased business dynamism. Activity could also be supported by a sustained easing in trade tensions. Policies to foster stability and sustainably lift medium-term growth prospects require a keen focus on restoring fiscal buffers, preserving price and financial stability, reducing uncertainty, and implementing structural reforms without further delay.",

      "fullText": "China\u2019s Five-Year Plans have long served as the backbone of its economic and social transformation. Since the launch of the first plan in 1953, these policy blueprints have guided the country from socialist industrialization to export-led growth and mass urbanization.\nUniquely, China remains the only major economy to have successfully completed every Five-Year Plan with broadly achieved objectives. As Beijing prepares for the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026\u20132030), the shift underway carries profound implications not only for China\u2019s future development but also for the global political economy.\nFor much of the reform era, particularly during the 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans, China pursued high-speed growth driven by heavy investment, industrial expansion, and exports. This model delivered extraordinary results, including sustained double-digit GDP growth and China\u2019s rise as the world\u2019s manufacturing hub.\nThe 13th Plan began acknowledging a \u201cnew normal\u201d of slower growth, yet quantitative expansion remained central. By the late 2010s, however, structural constraints\u2014overcapacity, environmental degradation, declining investment returns, demographic pressures, and intensifying geopolitical competition\u2014made a strategic recalibration unavoidable.\nThe turning point came with the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021\u20132025), which marked a decisive move away from growth at all costs. Notably, it avoided setting a rigid GDP growth target and instead elevated the concept of \u201chigh-quality development.\u201d\nInnovation, technological self-reliance, environmental sustainability, and social equity replaced sheer expansion as policy priorities. The emphasis on supply-chain security and the \u201cdual circulation\u201d strategy reflected China\u2019s response to global uncertainty and external pressures.\nThe forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan builds on this transformation. Covering the period from 2026 to 2030, it represents a critical phase in China\u2019s long-term goal of basically achieving socialist modernization by 2035. The plan is expected to consolidate China\u2019s shift toward an innovation-led, resilient, and people-centered economy, focusing on quality rather than speed of growth.\nTechnological self-reliance will be a central pillar. China aims to strengthen indigenous innovation in strategic sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum technology, bio manufacturing, hydrogen energy, and space industries. This drive is designed to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and foreign restrictions, but it also has global implications, particularly as technological competition with Western economies intensifies.\nEqually significant is the plan\u2019s strong commitment to green development. China has already emerged as the world\u2019s largest investor in renewable energy, accounting for a substantial share of global solar and wind capacity additions. The 15th Plan is expected to further integrate ecological protection, clean energy, and low-carbon industrial systems into economic planning, aligning growth with climate responsibility.\nSocial modernization is another defining feature. Building on the vision of \u201ccommon prosperity,\u201d the plan emphasizes rural revitalisation, urban renewal, demographic resilience, and improved social welfare. By strengthening domestic consumption and reducing regional disparities, China seeks to create a more balanced and inclusive development model.\nBeyond its domestic agenda, the 15th Five-Year Plan carries wide international significance. It reinforces China\u2019s intention to remain engaged with the global economy while reshaping globalisation through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development, Security, Civilisation, and Governance Initiatives.\nFor developing regions in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa, the plan signals a shift toward higher quality, sustainable, and innovation-oriented cooperation.\nFor countries like Pakistan, this presents both opportunities and challenges. Chinese investment can support infrastructure development, industrial upgrading, and energy transition. At the same time, it underscores the need for careful policy choices to ensure economic sustainability, strategic balance, and long-term national interests.\nUltimately, China\u2019s 15th Five-Year Plan symbolizes a historic transition\u2014from rapid catch-up growth to qualitative, innovation-driven, and environmentally conscious modernization. Its success will shape not only China\u2019s internal resilience and technological leadership but also the future contours of global trade, innovation, and development. As such, the plan deserves close attention well beyond China\u2019s borders.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nDr Zafaruddin Mahmood\nThe writer has served as Pakistan\u2019s first Consul General, at Shanghai and speaks fluent Mandarin.

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal announced the imposition of an \u201cExport Emergency\u201d in the country entailing the creation of a special cell in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to address problems and constraints facing the business community on an urgent basis with the objective of increasing exports by 40 percent in four years and 200 percent by 2035.\nHis statement reflects an awareness of a decline in exports leading to a rise in the trade deficit during the first half of the current year against the same period the year before \u2014 negative USD 19,204 million as opposed to negative USD 14,271 million \u2014 which implies that the reliance on foreign borrowing, including rollovers from friendly countries, borrowing from bilaterals and multilaterals, to shore up foreign exchange reserves continues unabated.\nAwareness of a problem is the first step towards its resolution and requires sector experts/stakeholders to delve into the causes of the problem and formulate a set of remedial measures designed to resolve it in the short, medium and ideally long term.\nThere is a plethora of empirical research gathering dust in government offices that highlights the reasons behind Pakistan\u2019s cyclical economic volatility.\nThe October 2024 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report titled Request for an Extended Fund Arrangement reiterated the crux of the problem notably \u201ceconomic volatility has only increased over time, with a tight correlation between Pakistan\u2019s boom-bust economic outcomes and its macroeconomic policies.\u201d The report, disturbingly, added that \u201ccompared to nine other regional peers, the country\u2019s export growth since 2000 has been second to last, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.\nREAD MORE:BR RESEARCH: Pakistan\u2019s export performance: the emergency reflex\nThe country\u2019s trade restrictions (including exchange measures, tariff and non-tariff barriers, restrictions to payments, etc.) have placed it consistently at or around the 90th percentile of the highest Measurement of Aggregate Trade Restrictions index\u2026. This high level of protection has not helped improve, and likely undermined, Pakistan\u2019s competitiveness.\u201d One can only hope that the export emergency cell would take cognizance of these observations and not repeat past mistakes which have been to extend monetary and fiscal subsidies to specific influential sectors with the objective of increasing exports, which would reactivate the boom-bust syndrome.\nWhile setting up an export emergency cell in the PM Office indicates that that the government has elevated it at the highest executive level, thereby facilitating appropriate policy decisions promptly, there is a need to carefully review the pledges made by the economic team leaders to the Fund \u2014 pledges that if not met may not only lead to a cessation of the next tranche release but as has been evident since 2019 may lead to the three friendly countries refusing to roll over 12 billion dollars to another year.\nThe Fund\u2019s advice is implicit in its observation: \u201cwith an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles, the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products. Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors.\u201d In other words, structural reforms are required that do not consist of monetary or fiscal incentives or setting up special economic zones, that the government has pledged to phase out and not announce any new ones but to end all existing economic distortions.\nIf past precedence is anything to go by an \u2018export emergency cell\u2019 will undertake measures that would bring it in conflict with pledges made to the IMF. To increase our leverage with the Fund would require taking measures that would be supported by the Fund and include ending the energy cross-subsidy paid for by industry, reducing current expenditure to create fiscal space that would ease the vise-like application of the Federal Board of Revenue\u2019s audit function being described as harassment by industry, end red tape implicit in any new venture and end the elite capture of both budgeted resources as well as outlay.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

This would be the same pace of growth as in 2025.\nBut the Washington-based lender cautioned in its World Economic Outlook update that \u201cthe resilience exhibited so far is driven largely by a few sectors,\u201d signaling vulnerability.\nWhile the global economy appears to be \u201cshaking off the trade and tariff disruptions of 2025,\u201d this does not mean they had no impact, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.\nInstead, the challenges were offset by \u201ctailwinds from the AI and tech investment boom,\u201d he told reporters.\nThis was especially true in North America and Asia, the IMF said.\nThe private sector also showed adaptability in dealing with trade shocks, while fiscal and monetary support provided boosts.\nAfter he returned to the White House last January, US President Donald Trump unleashed sweeping tariffs that hit allies and competitors alike, roiling financial markets and supply chains while causing trade tensions to rocket.\nBut temperatures cooled over the year as the Trump administration struck tariff deals with several partners and crucially reached a temporary truce with the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, China. For now, global inflation is expected to drop from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2025 to 3.8 percent in 2026.\nTrump\u2019s latest tariff threats against eight European countries in a standoff over the Danish territory of Greenland have thrown a spanner in the works.\n\u201cWe see that we\u2019re in this world in which trade tensions can erupt, geopolitical tensions can erupt. And that\u2019s a downside risk for the global economy,\u201d Gourinchas toldAFPduring an interview in Brussels.\nNonetheless, the IMF said trade policy uncertainty remains much higher than in January 2025 and there could still be occasional flare-ups.\nThe US Supreme Court is also due to rule on the legality of Trump\u2019s use of emergency economic powers to impose tariffs on goods from virtually all trading partners.\nThe high court is widely expected to deliver a decision in early 2026, the fund said.\nThe strikedown of some duties would \u201cinject another dose of trade policy uncertainty into the global economy,\u201d Gourinchas added.\nOne concern is how Trump could tap other legal authorities to reimpose tariffs. Another issue is how the court ruling would impact government revenues, and therefore fiscal policies, he added.\nBesides trade, the AI boom pushing the global economy forward comes with its own risks, Gourinchas said.\nHe flagged the risk of a \u201cmarket correction\u201d if expectations about AI gains, productivity and profitability are not realized.\nA major catalyst of recent Wall Street stock records has been bullish sentiment about artificial intelligence.\nHowever, if growth due to AI turns out to be unrealistic, a big drop in the stock market \u2014 a correction \u2014 could damage the economy if consumers pull back.\nThe pickup in tech investment and expenditure was estimated to add around 0.3 percentage points to average annualized US GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2025.\nThis offset a drag from the lengthy government shutdown late in the year.\nGourinchas noted the divergence between the United States \u2014 which is seeing a jump in AI tech investment \u2014 and other advanced economies.\nThe IMF estimates US growth at 2.4 percent this year, 0.3 percentage points higher than predicted in October.\nIn contrast, it expects euro area growth of 1.3 percent, and a slower pace in Japan.\nGrowth in China and India is also \u201crelatively strong\u201d compared with other emerging markets, Gourinchas said.\nMost of the upward revision in global growth this time was accounted for by the United States and China, the IMF said.\nLooking ahead, Gourinchas stressed the need for central bank independence, so that they can pursue their mandate of price stability and financial stability.\nHe did not comment on an ongoing US Justice Department probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nBut he noted that the importance of the US dollar for the international monetary system means it is \u201ceven more important\u201d the Fed is able to do its job and do it well.",

Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,\u201d the report read.\nRead more:ECC approves Rs659.65bn govt guarantee for circular debt financing\nThe regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the \u201cold era of scarcity is ending\u201d, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might \u201cprove to be even more complex\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.\nIn its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.\nMeanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the \u2018Take or Pay\u2019 electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.\nNEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.\n\u201cA significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan\u2019s power system.\u201d\nThe regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.\n\u201cIt remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.\u201d\nOn the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.\nRead more:Circular debt rose Rs79bn on \u2018seasonable, operational factors\u2019: Power Division\nAt the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.\n\u201cGovernance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan\u2019s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,\u201d the NEPRA report said.\nKE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.\nIn contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.\nQESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.\nIn terms of recovery, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) was the best-placed DISCO with a recovery rate of 101.7%, followed by GEPCO and LESCO.",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: Despite lofty assurances, reform roadmaps and repeated declarations of intent, the government\u2019s narrative on fixing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) rings hollow when confronted with unforgiving fiscal reality.\nIn the first full fiscal year of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s government, SOEs slid deeper into financial distress, with their cumulative net losses surging by nearly 300 percent, soaring from Rs30.6 billion in FY2023-24 to a massive Rs122.9 billion in FY2024-25. These numbers, presented by the finance ministry at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises last week, expose a widening gap between promise and performance.A closer reading of the data deepens this disquiet. The combined revenues of SOEs fell over 10 percent to Rs12.4 trillion in FY2024-25, while even among profitable enterprises, earnings lost momentum, with aggregate profits sliding 13 percent from the previous year to end at Rs710 billion.\nREAD MORE:ADB approves $540mn financing to advance SOE reforms, coastal resilience in Pakistan\nLoss-making SOEs offered little comfort, with their combined losses easing by a negligible two percent, a change too small to signal any meaningful turnaround. Worse still, SOEs also drew a massive Rs2.1 trillion in annual fiscal support, underscoring how public resources continue to be funneled into chronic inefficiency rather than productive growth. These fiscal flows were driven largely by higher equity injections to address the circular debt build-up, making it patently clear that public funds are being used to manage distress, and not to resolve the structural failures that continue to drag SOEs and the wider economy down.\nWhile the finance ministry attributes the decline in SOE revenues primarily to falling international oil prices, which compressed margins in the oil sector, this factor can only explain a small part of the slowdown, and cannot account for the sheer magnitude of the losses now weighing on the public balance sheet. These losses, it must be noted, are not broadly spread but heavily concentrated in a small cluster of entities, most notably the National Highway Authority and several power distribution companies (DISCOs). This is hardly a new development. These entities have long been mired in inefficiency and chronic red ink, underscoring that the losses in FY2024-25 reflect deep-seated structural failures rather than temporary market fluctuations. Nowhere is this more evident than in DISCOs, which have come to embody the power sector\u2019s systemic decay: a crumbling transmission and distribution (T&D) network haemorrhaging revenue through electricity theft, excessive line losses and chronic mis-governance. High depreciation and financing costs compound the problem, as an ageing T&D infrastructure inflates balance sheets without generating commensurate revenue, while repeated borrowing to bridge cash shortfalls and service circular debt accumulates interest expenses, locking these entities into a self-perpetuating cycle of financial stress.\nEven when it comes to profit-making SOEs, the system\u2019s limits are apparent, as their returns often rely on guaranteed government contracts, leaving open the question of whether they could survive under genuine open market competition. The need for a bold, wide-ranging reform agenda for SOEs, then, remains urgent, yet progress on the ground has been painfully slow.\nEfforts so far have been piecemeal, lacking coherence, and often driven more by pressure from international lenders than by a genuine commitment to restructuring loss-making entities. Meaningful change would require comprehensive sectoral reorganisation, greater deregulation to foster competition and the establishment of robust corporate governance frameworks to tackle inefficiencies, while strengthening transparency and accountability.\nWhat we\u2019ve had on our hands instead is political inertia and bureaucratic resistance. This has meant that for an administration that has repeatedly promised sweeping SOE reform, plans remain largely on paper, execution is patchy at best and the cost of delay keeps mounting.\nThe government must recognise that without decisive action on SOE governance, accountability and privatisation, the reform narrative will remain meaningless while the financial haemorrhage continues unabated.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: An assessment of Pakistan\u2019s power sector during FY 2024-25 prompted National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to observe that despite several structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remains limited and insufficient to inspire confidence in the sector\u2019s ability to support sustained industrial growth or provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential segments.\nIn its State of the Industry Report 2024-25, NEPRA stated that the power sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain efficiency and undermine its contribution to economic development.\nThe regulator emphasized that power sector entities must operate under commercially binding agreements that clearly define roles, performance standards, and accountability mechanisms.\nREAD MORE:NEPRA could come under Power Division\u2019s control, as per govt\u2019s latest amendments\nEach entity should bear the financial consequences of its inefficiencies rather than passing these costs on to consumers, who are currently burdened with approximately Rs233 billion in Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)\u2014a cost arising not from normal business operations but from inefficiencies within certain sector entities.\nAccording to the report, generation capacity under \u201cTake or Pay\u201d contracts remains significantly underutilized, resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants. Simultaneously, the transmission network is both constrained and underutilized, contributing to higher transmission tariffs and preventing the dispatch of cheaper and more efficient electricity in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).\nOn the distribution side, several government-owned DISCOs continue to suffer from poor governance, with transmission and distribution (T&D) losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery, and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. These inefficiencies further exacerbate asset underutilisation across generation, transmission, and distribution, while fueling the circular debt problem.\nNepra noted that challenges faced by power sector entities\u2014largely government-owned\u2014span planning, execution, and operational domains.\nPersistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered financial sustainability and limited the sector\u2019s contribution to economic growth. Weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management further constrain the sector\u2019s ability to provide reliable and affordable electricity.\nDuring FY 2024-25, efforts were made to reduce \u201cTake or Pay\u201d generation capacity through the retirement or decommissioning of inefficient power plants with consistently low utilisation. As a result, 2,829 MW of capacity was retired, decommissioned, or had its Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) terminated.\nConsequently, effective operational generation capacity declined to 41,121 MW as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888 MW a year earlier. However, 884 MW of new hydropower capacity\u2014Suki Kinari Hydropower Project\u2014was added during the year.\nThe utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the CPPA-G system remained 38.82%. NEPRA highlighted that generation costs account for nearly 82% of the electricity tariff. During FY 2024-25, the actual per-unit Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) stood at Rs14.21/kWh, the highest component of the electricity tariff, primarily due to underutilisation of \u201cTake or Pay\u201d plants.\nDuring the year, several power plants approached NEPRA through CPPA-G seeking reductions in generation tariffs. Approval of these adjustments is expected to yield long-term benefits by lowering generation costs, improving tariff efficiency, and stabilizing consumer prices, while also supporting investor confidence through a predictable regulatory environment.\nHowever, NEPRA noted that persistent inefficiencies in public sector power plants \u2014 such as the 747 MW Guddu Power Plant, 969 MW Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, and several WAPDA-operated hydro plants\u2014are undermining tariff reduction efforts. These inefficiencies result in lower utilisation, higher costs, and reduced system efficiency, offsetting gains from IPP tariff reductions and plant retirements.\nThe Part Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) added Rs46.388 billion to generation costs in FY 2024-25, compared to Rs55.671 billion in 2023-24, and, while unavoidable, these costs can be significantly reduced through effective demand-side management.\nSimilarly, Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) costs declined to Rs13.285 billion, from Rs39.521 billion, though NEPRA said further reductions are possible through better grid management.\nLower utilisation of Thar coal-based power plants, which operated at 67.23% utilisation, also raised generation costs by inflating both CPP and Energy Purchase Price (EPP). Delays in ensuring regular coal supply to Lucky Electric Power Company further exacerbated inefficiencies.\nNepra observed widespread underutilisation of transmission assets, including the 4,000 MW Matiari\u2013Lahore HVDC line, which operated at just 35% utilisation despite payments based on full availability. Manual system logs further hinder accurate assessment of transmission performance.\nThe poor performance of the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) has led to violations of the economic merit order, increased generation costs, project delays, and cost overruns. Delays in key projects\u2014including KE-NGC interconnection, Lahore North Grid, and SCADA-III\u2014have adversely affected system reliability and finances.\nGovernance remains the most critical issue confronting DISCOs. KE, PESCO, HESCO, SEPCO, and QESCO were identified as the poorest performers, with excessive losses, low recovery, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Except for TESCO, no DISCO met Nepra-approved T&D loss targets.\nWeak DISCO performance contributed approximately Rs397 billion to circular debt during the year. Nepra termed load-shedding based on AT&C losses unlawful and inequitable, as it penalizes compliant consumers and deepens sector inefficiencies.\nRising electricity costs and poor service have pushed consumers\u2014particularly affluent ones\u2014towards rooftop solar PV systems and battery storage, reducing grid demand during non-solar hours.\nNepra also expressed concern over the underperformance of the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO), citing limited adoption of modern technologies and the absence of a fully functional SCADA system.\nThe regulator concluded that Pakistan\u2019s power sector transformation remains incomplete without full implementation of the 1992 WAPDA Restructuring Plan, emphasizing corporatization, decentralization, privatization, and separation of policy, regulation, and operations. Continued centralized control, overlapping mandates, and weak accountability, it warned, will perpetuate inefficiencies and impose unnecessary financial burdens on the economy.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: While acknowledging that K-Electric has no role in the accumulation of circular debt, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has noted that KE consumers are nonetheless paying a Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per kWh, highlighting the inequitable burden of sector inefficiencies on electricity users.\nNepra stated that despite determining consumer-end tariffs in a manner that fully covers the revenue requirements of all entities across the power supply chain, persistent structural inefficiencies and the historical poor performance of distribution companies (Discos) leave little reason to expect that circular debt can be sustainably controlled.\nThe regulator explained that if NEPRA-determined tariffs were fully implemented and all sector entities met prescribed performance targets, each entity\u2019s financial obligations would be met and circular debt would not arise.\nREAD MORE:Govt wants to alter KE consumer-end tariff as per Nepra fixation\nHowever, in practice, several power sector entities fail to achieve these targets due to weak governance, poor recovery performance, and high technical and commercial losses, resulting in insufficient revenue collection and the continued accumulation of circular debt.\nAs of June 30, 2025, circular debt in Pakistan\u2019s power sector stood at approximately Rs1.614 trillion, compared to Rs2.393 trillion a year earlier, reflecting a reduction of around Rs780 billion. Nepra noted, however, that this decline does not represent a structural improvement and mirrors similar short-term reductions seen in the past.\nAccording to Nepra, both current and previous declines in circular debt primarily resulted from external financial injections rather than from meaningful sector reforms. During FY 2024-25, DISCO inefficiencies contributed approximately Rs265 billion through excessive T&D losses and Rs132 billion due to low recovery ratios. Despite these shortcomings, the overall circular debt figure declined during the year.\nNepra attributed this reduction to the Government of Pakistan securing commercial financing to retire liabilities of Power Holding (Private) Limited (PHPL) and clear arrears owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). While this intervention temporarily lowered circular debt, it failed to address the sector\u2019s underlying inefficiencies.\nTo service the cost of this borrowing, most electricity consumers \u2014 excluding a few protected domestic categories\u2014are now required to pay an additional Rs3.23 per kWh under the Debt Servicing Surcharge for several years. Nepra noted that this surcharge effectively transfers the burden of sector inefficiencies to consumers and represents one of the largest components of the end-user tariff, after the Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) and Energy Purchase Price (EPP).\nNepra further stated that KE, the country\u2019s only private-sector distribution company, does not contribute to circular debt, as it absorbs the financial impact of higher losses and lower recoveries instead of passing these costs on to consumers. Despite this, KE consumers remain subject to the DSS. To date, KE has collected and remitted Rs35.76 billion under the DSS to the Government of Pakistan and CPPA-G.\nThe regulator observed that had public-sector Discos been privatized in line with the 1992 power sector reform strategy, trillions of rupees in losses could have been avoided, and consumers would have benefited from improved service quality. Nepra added that although challenges to privatization persist even after more than two decades, these hurdles can be overcome through well-designed strategies and firm political commitment.\nGiven the prevailing structural inefficiencies and the historical performance of Discos, Nepra concluded that there is little justification to expect sustainable control of circular debt or lasting improvements in the power sector under the existing framework.\nREAD MORE:Consumers of KE, others: Govt to pass on Rs53.4bn relief under QTA for Q4\u201925\nNepra data shows that KE has recorded a sustained decline in transmission and distribution losses since its privatization in 2005, when losses were reported at around 40 percent. By FY 2024-25, KE\u2019s losses had fallen to below 15 percent, a level that remains above ideal benchmarks but is significantly lower than those observed across several public-sector Discos. The regulator attributed this long-term reduction to improved governance mechanisms and greater operational accountability following privatization.\nIn its assessment of recovery performance, Nepra observed that KE absorbed the impact of recovery shortfalls internally rather than transferring the burden to the power supply chain. While KE consumers continued to pay the federally imposed Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS), under which Rs. 35.76 billion was collected during the year, the utility itself did not add to sector-wide payment arrears, distinguishing its financial treatment from that of government-owned Discos.\nReferring to broader sector reforms, Nepra noted that KE\u2019s post-privatization experience illustrates the potential benefits of reduced government control, including greater financial discipline and operational responsiveness. However, the regulator cautioned that KE\u2019s performance should be viewed as part of a wider reform discussion rather than an isolated solution, emphasising that comprehensive structural changes across all distribution companies would be required to achieve sustainable sector-wide improvement.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

Nepra reports have almost always followed this timeline. Given the scale and complexity of the SOIR, a January release is entirely plausible. Delays are structural, not exceptional.\nAt another level, the ministry\u2019s own entities bear responsibility. Persistent failures in timely submission of generation, distribution, transmission, and collection data may well have ledinto these lags.\nTo call the flagship report \u201cdated and misleading\u201d is sour in taste. Six months do not fundamentally change sector dynamics. No ground-breaking initiatives have occurred in that period that could invalidate Nepra\u2019s findings.\nIf the ministry genuinely objects to \u201cmisleading conclusions,\u201d the solution is simple: publish monthly or quarterly sectoral data publicly. Transparent, timely disclosure would allow researchers and policymakers to assess the sector accurately, rather than relying on reactive rebuttals.\nREAD MORE:Power sector: Nepra sees \u2018limited\u2019 progress despite fixes\nThe minister takes issue with Nepra\u2019s characterization of the Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per unit as \u201cadditional.\u201d Technically, he is correct. The surcharge, levied to collect a small matter of Rs1800 billion to service the loans stemming from the government\\s own colossal perennialinefficiency, over the next six years, is not new.\nBut winning the technical point misses the larger reality. This surcharge is the biggest exercise yet of penalizing the paying public for government inefficiencies. It is a tacit admission that the system cannot run without transferring the cost of loans, subsidies, and operational shortfalls directly to households.\nContrary to Leghari\u2019s framing, the DSS did not exist forever. It was introduced at the start of FY24, and the government has now formally extended it for six more years from FY25. This is not a minor clarification. It is a direct burden on the public, effectively stamping in place a mechanism to extract billions to keep a poorly managed system afloat.\nThe minister went a step further by rejecting Nepra\u2019s claim that system losses above regulatory targets impose an unnecessary burden on consumers. According to the minister, these gaps, both high losses and low recoveries, are financed by the Ministry of Finance through general revenue and therefore do not burden electricity consumers.\nThis argument takes the cake.\nLosses above allowed limits and recoveries below targets feed directly and mechanically into the circular debt pipeline. There is no abstraction here. Every rupee lost due to inefficiency adds to the debt stock that the system cannot pay for on its own.\nTo argue that additions to circular debt do not burden consumers is baffling. Consumers are already paying for it. The DSS exists precisely because the bulk of circular debt flows from distribution inefficiencies and collection failures. In FY25 alone, losses and recoveries still imposed a toll of no less than Rs400 billion, the second highest annual accumulation in history despite claimed improvements.\nThe impact does not stop there. Transmission and distribution losses are routinely factored into quarterly tariff adjustments, which the regulator hears and approves every three months. These adjustments translate directly into higher bills. The link between losses and consumer burden is neither theoretical nor indirect. It is embedded in the tariff structure itself.\nClaiming that the government absorbs the entire cost through general revenue is both incorrect and insensitive. General revenue is taxpayer money. Diverting it to cover inefficiencies in the power sector crowds out spending on health, education, and development. It does not eliminate the burden. It merely shifts and disguises it.\nTo trivialize this reality by suggesting that inefficiencies funded through the budget are somehow benign reflects a deeper problem. It normalizes failure. It treats the misuse of public resources as acceptable. And it ignores the fact that consumers pay for inefficiency twice, once through electricity bills and again through taxes.\nResponding to assessment that rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar adoption, and that weak economic activity further suppressed demand, the minister countered by claiming the average tariff had declined from Rs53.04 per unit in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit by December 2025.\nChoosing one\u2019s own goalposts because it suits the narrative is typical of governments. Yes, tariffs have come down from their peaks. But that is like saying the scoreline improved from a 10\u20130 loss two years ago to a 7\u20130 loss this time.\nThe fact remains that electricity tariffs are still very high. Marginal relief does not erase cumulative damage. Nor does it restore confidence in the grid.\nThe shift to solar will not reverse simply because tariffs have slipped a few points. Consumers made that shift when electricity became unaffordable and unpredictable. That calculation has not changed.\nIf anything, the economics now tilt further away from the grid. Solar panels continue to get cheaper. Payback periods are shortening. Every incremental reduction in equipment cost reinforces the exit decision.\nAgainst this backdrop, citing a fall in average tariffs misses the point. Behavior has already changed. The grid is competing not with past tariffs, but with falling solar costs and permanently altered consumer expectations.\nData delays do not negate dysfunction. Surcharges do not stop being burdens because they are relabeled. Losses do not disappear because they are routed through the budget. And tariffs do not become affordable because they fall from extreme to merely high.\nThe power sector\u2019s problem is not perception. It is credibility. Until inefficiency is addressed at source rather than socialized through consumers and taxpayers, the exodus from the grid will continue. And no amount of arithmetic will change that.",

On Sunday, in a rare development, sitting Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari publicly rebutted figures presented in Nepra\u2019s State of Industry Report 2024\u201325.\n\u201cThe World Bank has held one meeting with the concerned authorities and conveyed its concerns regarding the proposed replacement of the term \u2018Federal Government\u2019 with Division\u2019. Another meeting is expected in the coming days,\u201d the sources added.\nThe country\u2019s business community and industrial sector have also expressed serious concerns over the Power Division\u2019s move, warning that it could force the regulator to compromise its independence.\nAccording to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also taken notice of the Power Division\u2019s move regarding amendments to the Nepra Act.\n\u201cThe prime minister has directed the Power minister to discuss the matter with him,\u201d the sources quoted the PM Office as saying.\nSection 3(a) of the Act empowers the Authority to determine tariffs, rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services by generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and to recommend these to the relevant division for notification.\nUnder the revised Section 31(7), notification of Nepra-approved tariffs or uniform tariffs \u2014 along with rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services\u2014shall be made in the official Gazette by the division concerned within 30 days of intimation by the Authority.\nREAD MORE:Nepra approves uniform national average tariff, ignoring industry and export sector concerns\nIf the division fails to notify the tariff or refer the matter back to Nepra for reconsideration within the specified timeframe, the Authority may direct immediate application of its approved tariff through notification, subject to any subsequent adjustments arising from reconsideration requested by the Division.\nSection 31(7)(i) provides that the division concerned may, within 30 days of receiving Nepra\u2019s intimation regarding approved tariffs of public-sector distribution and supply licensees, require the Authority to reconsider its determination on issues common to these licensees. The Nepra would then be required to complete the reconsideration within 30 days and inform the division accordingly.\nUnder Section 31(7)(ii), the Nepra may make quarterly tariff adjustments within 15 days on account of capacity and transmission charges, transmission and distribution losses, variable operation and maintenance costs, and policy guidelines issued by the division concerned.\nThe adjusted tariff would be intimated to the division prior to Gazette notification. The division may seek reconsideration within 15 days, failing which Nepra shall notify the adjusted tariff in the official Gazette. If reconsideration is sought, the Nepra must decide the matter within 15 days and intimate the division before notification.\nSection 31(7)(iii) allows the division concerned, in lieu of seeking reconsideration, to file an appeal. However, once a reconsideration request is filed, the Power Division will not be entitled to subsequently appeal the decision on that reconsideration. No changes have been proposed to Section 31(7)(iv).\nSimilarly, amendments have been proposed to the Electricity Act, 1910, replacing the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cappropriate authority\u201d or \u201cdivision concerned.\u201d\nUnder the revised Section 32(2), any dispute between an operator and the telegraph authority regarding the placement or operation of electric supply lines shall be referred to the division concerned, which may direct the operator to make necessary alterations to comply with the law. Amendments to Section 53(1)(a) relate to the service of notices, orders, or documents, stipulating that where the addressee is the Federal or Provincial Government, such service shall be made at the office designated by the division concerned.\nBusiness Recordersent few questions to Power Division. Questions and their response are as follows\nThe primary purpose of the proposed amendments is to remove procedural difficulties and avoid unnecessary administrative delays. Following the Mustafa Impex judgment, the Federal Cabinet directed all ministries to review existing laws, rules, and regulations to ensure that routine and technical matters are not escalated to the Cabinet where such escalation is not required. Accordingly, the amendments mainly replace the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cconcerned Division\u201d in limited procedural contexts to streamline filings, notifications, and technical reviews, without altering the substantive regulatory framework.\nNo. This understanding is incorrect. The amendments do not make Nepra subordinate to the Power Division in any manner. The Nepra remains an independent statutory regulator, administratively reporting to the Federal Cabinet. No changes have been proposed that require amendments to the Rules of Business or that alter Nepra\u2019s legal status, independence, or quasi-judicial authority. The amendments are strictly administrative and do not interfere with Nepra\u2019s core regulatory mandate.\nNo. Wherever policy decisions or policy directions are involved, the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d has been consciously retained in the law. At no place do the proposed amendments authorise the Power Division to issue policy directions independently or bypass the Federal Cabinet. The scope of the changes is limited to procedural and technical matters only.\nThe Federal Cabinet has approved the draft set of proposed amendments. Following this, the draft legislation will undergo due legal vetting and finalisation. Once completed, the bill will be submitted to Parliament through the Parliamentary Affairs Division, in accordance with the prescribed legislative process.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The World Bank (WB) has reportedly raised concerns over proposed amendments to the Nepra Act, 1997, and the Electricity Act, 1910, which may compromise the independence of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), well-informed sources toldBusiness Recorder.\nUnder the proposed changes, the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d is being replaced with \u201cPower Division\u201d or \u201cdivision concerned\u201d for the approval of various regulatory proposals. On Sunday, in a rare development, sitting Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari publicly rebutted figures presented in Nepra\u2019s State of Industry Report 2024\u201325.\n\u201cThe World Bank has held one meeting with the concerned authorities and conveyed its concerns regarding the proposed replacement of the term \u2018Federal Government\u2019 with Division\u2019. Another meeting is expected in the coming days,\u201d the sources added.\nThe country\u2019s business community and industrial sector have also expressed serious concerns over the Power Division\u2019s move, warning that it could force the regulator to compromise its independence.\nAccording to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also taken notice of the Power Division\u2019s move regarding amendments to the Nepra Act.\n\u201cThe prime minister has directed the Power minister to discuss the matter with him,\u201d the sources quoted the PM Office as saying.\nSection 3(a) of the Act empowers the Authority to determine tariffs, rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services by generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and to recommend these to the relevant division for notification.\nUnder the revised Section 31(7), notification of Nepra-approved tariffs or uniform tariffs \u2014 along with rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services\u2014shall be made in the official Gazette by the division concerned within 30 days of intimation by the Authority.\nREAD MORE:Nepra approves uniform national average tariff, ignoring industry and export sector concerns\nIf the division fails to notify the tariff or refer the matter back to Nepra for reconsideration within the specified timeframe, the Authority may direct immediate application of its approved tariff through notification, subject to any subsequent adjustments arising from reconsideration requested by the Division.\nSection 31(7)(i) provides that the division concerned may, within 30 days of receiving Nepra\u2019s intimation regarding approved tariffs of public-sector distribution and supply licensees, require the Authority to reconsider its determination on issues common to these licensees. The Nepra would then be required to complete the reconsideration within 30 days and inform the division accordingly.\nUnder Section 31(7)(ii), the Nepra may make quarterly tariff adjustments within 15 days on account of capacity and transmission charges, transmission and distribution losses, variable operation and maintenance costs, and policy guidelines issued by the division concerned.\nThe adjusted tariff would be intimated to the division prior to Gazette notification. The division may seek reconsideration within 15 days, failing which Nepra shall notify the adjusted tariff in the official Gazette. If reconsideration is sought, the Nepra must decide the matter within 15 days and intimate the division before notification.\nSection 31(7)(iii) allows the division concerned, in lieu of seeking reconsideration, to file an appeal. However, once a reconsideration request is filed, the Power Division will not be entitled to subsequently appeal the decision on that reconsideration. No changes have been proposed to Section 31(7)(iv).\nSimilarly, amendments have been proposed to the Electricity Act, 1910, replacing the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cappropriate authority\u201d or \u201cdivision concerned.\u201d\nUnder the revised Section 32(2), any dispute between an operator and the telegraph authority regarding the placement or operation of electric supply lines shall be referred to the division concerned, which may direct the operator to make necessary alterations to comply with the law. Amendments to Section 53(1)(a) relate to the service of notices, orders, or documents, stipulating that where the addressee is the Federal or Provincial Government, such service shall be made at the office designated by the division concerned.\nBusiness Recordersent few questions to Power Division. Questions and their response are as follows\nThe primary purpose of the proposed amendments is to remove procedural difficulties and avoid unnecessary administrative delays. Following the Mustafa Impex judgment, the Federal Cabinet directed all ministries to review existing laws, rules, and regulations to ensure that routine and technical matters are not escalated to the Cabinet where such escalation is not required. Accordingly, the amendments mainly replace the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cconcerned Division\u201d in limited procedural contexts to streamline filings, notifications, and technical reviews, without altering the substantive regulatory framework.\nNo. This understanding is incorrect. The amendments do not make Nepra subordinate to the Power Division in any manner. The Nepra remains an independent statutory regulator, administratively reporting to the Federal Cabinet. No changes have been proposed that require amendments to the Rules of Business or that alter Nepra\u2019s legal status, independence, or quasi-judicial authority. The amendments are strictly administrative and do not interfere with Nepra\u2019s core regulatory mandate.\nNo. Wherever policy decisions or policy directions are involved, the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d has been consciously retained in the law. At no place do the proposed amendments authorise the Power Division to issue policy directions independently or bypass the Federal Cabinet. The scope of the changes is limited to procedural and technical matters only.\nThe Federal Cabinet has approved the draft set of proposed amendments. Following this, the draft legislation will undergo due legal vetting and finalisation. Once completed, the bill will be submitted to Parliament through the Parliamentary Affairs Division, in accordance with the prescribed legislative process.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "19-Change of name: A company can change its name subject to section 10, by special resolution. Section 10 relates to names not allowed.\nPreviously, approval of the Commission was required. The registrar\u2019s existing powers under section 10 to review proposed name appropriateness remain intact, thereby ensuring that regulatory safeguards are still maintained.\nWhere a company changes its name it shall, for a period of ninety days from the date of issue of a certificate by the registrar under sub-section (1), continue to mention its former name along with its new name on the outside of every office or place in which its business is carried on and in every document or notice referred to in section 22.\nREAD MORE:OPINION: Companies Act 2017: Significant proposed amendments by SECP \u2014 I\nProvided that this requirement shall not apply to a single member company and private company, not being Public Interest Company and subsidiary of listed company.\nCommencement of Business: The requirement under section 19 for a separate declaration of \u201ccommencement of business\u201d has become redundant and unnecessary in view of the existing legal and procedural framework. It is now proposed to be eliminated\nRegistered Office: A company shall have a correspondence or registered office to which all communications and notices shall be addressed. In case no registered office address is notified by the Company at time of incorporation, correspondence address shall be deemed as registered office address of the Company for all purposes of the Act.\nPrincipal Line of Business: Under the proposed amendment principle line may be replaced with sector name only in order to simplify procedure and cater requirement of economic survey and other government organization.\nThe International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) will be adopted for sector classification for which concept paper has already been issued. Moreover, change in sector is also not required to be reported on any separate form, such change will be updated in annual return and updated Articles of Association shall be filed with annual return.\nMerger of Public Sector not for profit companies: Public sector company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, may be merged into another public sector for-profit company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, or its assets can be transferred to another public sector for-profit company, directly or indirectly wholly owned by Government, provided that the transferor company has obtained funds or donations or seed money or capital only from the Government. Provided that section 42 company may be merged into another section 42 company, preferably having similar or identical objects subject to the provisions contained in section 284 of the Act.\nPrivate Company to Single Member Company: (1) A private company, not being a public interest company and a subsidiary of a listed company may be converted into a single-member company without prior approval of the Commission in writing by passing a special resolution.\nIssue of Shares at Discount: Subject to sanction of resolution for issue of shares at discount in the case of listed company the mandatory approval of Commission is being dispensed with. This is a step in the right direction.\nReduction in Capital: A private limited company having a share capital may reduce its share capital by special resolution and supported by a solvency statement of all the directors, as referred in Section 89A.\nThe company may reduce its share capital in any way, namely-\n(a) cancel any paid-up share capital which is lost or un-represented by available assets; or for which subscription money has not been received from subscribers;\n(b) pay off any paid-up share capital which is in excess of the needs of the company.\nIt is proposed to be prescribed. This is necessarily required as proposed for voluntary winding up of private limited companies.\n(a) accounting and book keeping services;\n(b) internal audit;\n(c) design and implementation of any financial information system;\n(d) actuarial services;\n(e) investment advisory services;\n(f) investment banking services;\n(g) rendering of outsourced financial services;\n(h) management services; and\n(i) any other kind of services as may be specified: Provided that an auditor or audit firm who or which has been performing any non-audit services shall comply with the provisions of this section before the closure of the first financial year of the company.\nExplanation.\u2014For the purposes of this sub-section, the term \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d shall include rendering of services by the auditor,\u2014\n(i) in case of auditor being an individual, either himself or through his relative or any other person connected or associated with such individual or through any other entity, whatsoever, in which such individual has significant influence or control, or whose name or trade-mark or brand is used by such individual;\n(ii) in case of auditor being a firm, either itself or through any of its partners or through its parent, subsidiary or associate entity or through any other entity, whatsoever, in which the firm or any partner of the firm has significant influence or control, or whose name or trade mark or brand is used by the firm or any of its partners.\nAt present, PSX Rule Book lists down the prohibited services. Pursuant to this a statutory auditor of a listed company is prohibited to provide following non-assurance services:\n(a) Preparing financial statements, accounting records and accounting services;\n(b) Financial information technology system design and implementation, significant to overall financial statements;\n(c) Appraisal or valuation services for material items of financial statements;\n(d) Acting as an Appointed Actuary within the meaning of the term defined by the Insurance Ordinance, 2000;\n(e) Actuarial advice and reviews in respect of provisioning and loss assessments for an insurance entity;\n(f) Internal audit services related to internal accounting controls, financial systems or financial statements;\n(g) Human resource services relating to:\n(i) Executive recruitment;\n(ii) Work performed (including secondments) where management decision will be made on behalf of a listed audit client;\n(h) Legal Services;\n(i) Management functions or decisions;\n(j) Corporate finance services, advice or assistance which may involve independence threats such as promoting, dealing in or underwriting of shares of audit clients;\n(k) Any exercise or assignment for estimation of financial effect of a transaction or event where an auditor provides litigation support services as identified in subsection 607 of the Code of Ethics for Chartered Accountants;\n(l) Share Registration Services (Transfer Agents); and\n(m) Any other service(s) which the Council with the prior approval of the Commission, may determine to be a \u201cprohibited service\u201d.\nRegister of members: Every company shall keep an electronic register of its members. An electronic register must contain such particulars of each member as may be specified.\nPower of Court to Rectify the Register of Members: Section 126 of the Companies Act, 2017 empowered the Court to order rectification of the register of members or debenture-holders in cases of fraudulent or erroneous entry, omission, or unnecessary delay. While this provision provided judicial oversight, in practice it resulted in lengthy, costly, and time-consuming litigation, even for matters of a purely administrative or procedural nature. With the evolution of corporate regulation and increased reliance on electronic filings and real-time data maintenance, the continued requirement of approaching courts for rectification of registers become disproportionate and inconsistent with modern regulatory practices. The retention of section 126 also resulted in duplication of remedies, as similar relief mechanisms already exist under sections 87 and 464 of the Act. Moreover to cater this, section 74A is inserted and sec 464(7) is amended to further address it.\nStatutory Meeting: The elimination of the requirement of holding a statutory meeting is proposed as the provision has no practical utility in the present regulatory framework.\nThe original objective of ensuring initial disclosure of a company\u2019s affairs is already achieved through existing requirements. .\nAnnual General Meeting: Every company is required to hold an annual general meeting within sixteen months from the date of its incorporation and thereafter once in every calendar year within a period of one hundred and twenty days following the close of its financial year. This requirement is proposed to be eliminated for private companies, not being public interest companies and subsidiaries of listed companies, where the board of directors holds at least seventy five percent of voting rights.\nProvisions as to meetings and votes.\u2014 A company may hold a general meeting-\na) at a physical venue; or\nb) by using virtual meeting technology through service providers in the manner prescribed; or c) both at a physical venue and by using virtual meeting technology through service providers in the manner prescribed.\nProvided that from a date to be notified by the Commission, every company shall be required to hold e-meetings and conduct e-voting through a prescribed e-platform, in the manner specified by the Commission, for such class or classes of companies as may be notified.\u2019\nExplanation: \u201cService provider\u201d means any person registered by the Commission to provide an e-platform for meetings in terms of Section 134A.\nCompanies face considerable practical difficulties in allocating nominal shareholding to the independent and woman directors for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of this section. Independent and female directors also face considerable difficulties dealing with ownership of the companies in which they are acting as independent directors, including cumbersome asset disclosures and tax-related disclosures at the time of transfer of shares.\nIndependent Director: The independent director of a listed company shall be elected or appointed in the same manner as specified by the Commission.\nDisqualification of Director: Where a person has been penalised under section 127 of the Act or has contravened the provisions of the sections 182, 184, 197, 208, 222, 243, 254, 261, 272, 324, 400, 401, 402, 405, 418, 424 and 497 or has been penalized under section 193 of the Act, the said person cannot be a director.\nLoan to Directors: Restriction on loan to directors shall not apply in case of loan given to the chief executive or the whole-time director who is an employee of the company, subject to the condition that the loan is given as per the approved company policy for loans to employees.\nMethod of Contracting: These provisions do not relate to Company have been deleted.\nLiability of Undesired Activities: Liability for \u201cundesired activities\u201d is subjective and restrictive for shareholders. Eliminating the section will reduce ambiguity and will give freedom to shareholders who are actual owners of the company.\nInspection of books of account by the Commission: It is proposed that for the purpose of ascertaining whether a company who is complying with or has complied with any provision or requirement of this Act or the terms and conditions of licence or registration, the Commission may from time to time inspect any record or document relating to any company. This provision already exists however it is proposed to clarify the matter.\nDeclaration of Dividend: At present, the following condition prevails:\n(2) No dividend shall be declared or paid by a company for any financial year out of the profits of the company made from the sale or disposal of any immovable property or assets of a capital nature comprised in the undertaking or any of the undertaking of the company, unless the business of the company consists, whether wholly or partly, of selling and purchasing any such property or assets, except after such profits are set off or adjusted against losses arising from the sale of any such immovable property or assets of a capital nature: Provided that no dividend shall be declared or paid out of unrealized gain on investment property credited to profit and loss account.\nThe provision is proposed to be replaced by:\n(2) A resolution of directors passed under subsection (1) shall contain a statement that, in the opinion of the directors, the company will immediately after the distribution, satisfy the solvency test.\nThe deletion of sub-section (2) removes restriction on dividend distribution from capital gains, which no longer reflects modern accounting standards and business realities. Instead, the proposed proviso introduces a solvency test to ensure that dividends, whether from current or accumulated profits, are declared only when the company can meet its financial obligations\nUnclaimed Dividend: The unclaimed dividend shall vest with the Federal Government with oversight by the Commission.\nCost Audit. Provisions relating to \u201cAudit of Cost Accounts\u201d are proposed to be eliminated.\nRight of Commission: A new provision has been inserted to the effect that the Commission may investigate a dispute exists among the members or directors regarding shareholding or directorship arising from a fraudulent entry, an entry made without sufficient cause, or an omission in the relevant statutory register.\nManagement by Administrator. The Commission or the registrar has been given powers to appoint administrators on its own motion also if a situation for appointment of administrator exists. Previously, this right was subject to the approval of members having not less than sixty percent of the paid up capital of a company or a secured creditor or secured creditors having interest equivalent\nProcess of voluntary winding up: The amendment proposes that the Court has no role in the process of voluntary winding-up proceedings, which are intended to be managed independently by the company and its creditors without judicial intervention. Accordingly, the power to approve any extension in the completion of winding-up proceedings has been aligned with the voluntary nature of the process and vested in the company, through a special resolution in the general meeting, and in the creditors\u2019 meeting in case of a creditors\u2019 voluntary winding up. This change ensures procedural consistency, reduces unnecessary court involvement, and promotes efficiency, self-regulation, and timely closure of companies.\nUnregistered Company: An unregistered company \u201cincludes any partnership, association or company consisting of more than seven members\u201d. This definition is proposed to be deleted.\nSecurity clearance of shareholder and director.\u2014The Commission may require the security clearance of any shareholder or director or other office bearer of a company or class of companies as may be notified by the concerned Minister-in-charge of the Federal Government.\nExplanation.\u2014 For the purposes of this section, the expression \u201cMinister-in-Charge of the Federal Government\u201d shall mean the Minister-in-Charge of the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control.\n(a) the document is complete in all material respects and complies with the requirements of law;\n(b) all prescribed fees and penalties, if any, have been duly paid; and\n(c) the document is properly authenticated in the manner prescribed, the registrar shall accept such return or document for registration and record the same in the register.\nThe registrar shall issue a certificate, acknowledgment, or such other confirmation of acceptance as may be prescribed.\nAcceptance of a document or return under this section shall not be construed as a certification of the correctness, validity, or legality of the contents thereof, and the responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the information contained therein shall remain with the company and its officers.\n(i) clear, legible, accessible, and capable of being readily retrieved;\n(ii) maintained in a manner that ensures authenticity, integrity, and reproducibility in accordance with applicable legal standards;\n(iii) capable of being produced or presented to the Commission or any other authority when so required under the law; and\n(iv) protected from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.\n(2) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-section (1), the Commission may, by notification or directive, require any company or class of companies to:-\n(i) maintain records in such system, programme, or format - whether physical, electronic, digital, or any combination thereof - as may be specified; and\n(ii) provide, submit, or transmit data or information in real time, periodic, or batch form through such physical or automated mechanism as may be prescribed, including but not limited to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Data Acquisition Portals (DAPs), Secure File Transfers (FTPs), or other secure and automated data-sharing systems.\n(3) The Commission may prescribe such standards, security protocols, and procedures as it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality, reliability, and lawful use of data transmitted or maintained under this section.\nThe Commission or the registrar may, upon an application being made to it within sixty days from the date of any order passed by it otherwise than in revision under sub-section (1), or on its own motion, review such order, and such review order shall be final.\nAn order passed or made by the Federal Government under this Act shall be subject to review by the Federal Government of its own motion or on an application made to it within sixty days from the date of the order.\nThe orders relating to mergers, etc., are supposed to be excluded from this provision.\nAppeal against order passed by officer of the Commission. Any person aggrieved by any order passed under this Act may, within thirty days of such order, except as otherwise provided in this Act, prefer an appeal to an officer authorized by the Commission where the order has been passed or upheld by the Registrar of Companies. Consequential to amendments proposed in section 464(6) & (7) where powers are given/amended to the Registrar of Companies. In light of these amendments, the appellate structure envisaged under section 480(a), which provides for an appeal to a registrar designated by the Commission against orders passed by officers subordinate to the Registrar, has become redundant and no longer relevant in the context of actions taken under sections 464(6) and (7).\nDefinition of the term \u2018material\u2019. It is proposed that it would mean any information which, if altered or obscured, would reasonably influence the decision of the stakeholders relying on such information.\n(Concluded)\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nSyed Shabbar Zaidi & Co.\nThe views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the newspaper",

PPMC is an unlicensed entity with no statutory role in engineering standards. NGC contributes approximately Rs 30\u201340 million per month.

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The National Grid Company (NGC) \u2014 formerly the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) \u2014 and the Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) have reportedly locked horns over the proposed retention of the Standards and Specifications (S&S) organisation, sources close to the Managing Director of PPMC toldBusiness Recorder.\nIn this regard, the Power Division has issued directions to NTDC, while the Minister has provided guidance regarding the transfer of the Standards and Specifications (S&S) function for 11kV and below from NGC to PPMC.\nHowever, as a state-owned enterprise, NGC is required to obtain formal approval from its Board of Directors for any such functional transfer. A due diligence process is currently under way.\nREAD MORE:Rs23bn NGC-PMLTC dispute lands in CPEC panel\u2019s camp\nBased on the findings of a constituted committee and NGC\u2019s institutional experience, the newly appointed Managing Director of NGC, Altaf Hussain Malik, has highlighted several critical risks associated with the proposed transfer.\nSafety and system integrity:The S&S function ensures uniformity, quality, and safety across the power distribution network. NGC possesses decades of engineering expertise, accredited laboratories, and compliance with international standards such as IEC, IEEE, and ANSI. Transferring this role to a non-engineering entity like PPMC\u2014which lacks the requisite technical capacity and testing infrastructure\u2014could compromise equipment reliability, increase system failures, and pose significant public safety risks.\nRegulatory and legal non-compliance:NGC operates under a Nepra licence, with the S&S mandate embedded in the Grid Code. PPMC is an unlicensed entity with no statutory role in engineering standards.\nAny such transfer would violate existing regulations and require extensive legislative and regulatory amendments, creating legal uncertainty and potential audit objections.\nFinancial and operational impact:The S&S office is a profitable, revenue-generating unit for NGC, contributing approximately Rs 30\u201340 million per month. Its transfer without proper financial and operational valuation would result in substantial revenue losses to the national exchequer and disrupt service continuity to DISCOs \u2014 none of which have raised concerns about NGC\u2019s current S&S services.\nMisalignment with sector reforms and global practice:Globally, standards and specifications are managed by utilities and are ultimately vested within distribution companies once they develop in-house capacity.\nTransferring this function to an intermediate, non-technical government entity does not align with international best practices and would add unnecessary bureaucratic layering without any technical or operational benefit.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly was informed on Monday that the total circular debt, which stood at Rs2,794 billion in March 2024, was brought down to Rs1,614 billion in June 2025 \u2013 marking an improvement of Rs780 billion within just one year.\nIn response to questions raised by lawmakers, Minister for Power Awais Leghari outlined a series of measures designed to curb the accumulation of circular debt.\nHe explained that the measures included negotiations with power producers to waive Rs260 billion in late payment interest charges, along with efforts to reduce inefficiencies within Distribution Companies (Discos), which led to an improvement of Rs193 billion. As a result, the debt in Discos decreased from Rs590 billion in 2024 to Rs397 billion in 2025, he added.\nHe also highlighted improvements in macroeconomic indicators \u2013 such as a stable exchange rate, lower KIBOR, and reduced inflation \u2013 as factors that contributed to lower tariffs and reduced markup charges on payables. These, in turn, played a key role in reducing the circular debt, he added. The minister also confirmed that K-Electric had resumed regular payments as part of the debt reduction plan.\nHe stated that the government has set a target to eliminate circular debt within the next six years, supported by parallel reforms aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the power sector. \u201cThis initiative is expected to lead to the removal of the Debt Servicing Surcharge, which currently stands at Rs3.23 per unit and is levied to cover the markup on circular debt payables,\u201d he added.\nAdditionally, he mentioned that the government plans to reconstitute the boards of Discos to further address inefficiencies within distribution companies.\nMoreover, he stated that the government has begun transitioning to a more competitive electricity market, moving away from the long-standing single-buyer model, where the state was the sole purchaser of electricity.\nThe new structure will operate through competitive bidding and market-based pricing under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contractual Market (CTBCM) framework, he added.\nDuring the question hour, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik assured the House that the domestic gas sector is receiving uninterrupted supply at optimal pressure, especially during peak cooking hours.\nHe added that Sui companies are ensuring daily gas availability from 5 am to 10 pm. Malik also informed the House that the addition of 12 LNG cargoes to the supply network had improved the availability of regasified LNG (RLNG), helping meet demand across all sectors. Additionally, a dedicated dashboard has been set up to address consumer complaints on a daily basis.\nParliamentary Secretary for Communications, Gul Asghar Khan, confirmed that all infrastructure projects carried out by the National Highway Authority (NHA) adhere to international standards.\nKhan explained that the design of highways includes a 10-year lifespan for pavements and 50 years for bridges and tunnels. He also stated that the feasibility study for the M-10 Motorway is near completion and that the project will be executed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The M-9 Karachi-Hyderabad expressway will remain unchanged.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "Weak performance by Pakistan\u2019s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country\u2019s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.\nThe report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with \u201crigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)\u201d to reduce tariffs were a milestone.\nHowever, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.\n\u201cOverall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,\u201d the report read.\nRead more:ECC approves Rs659.65bn govt guarantee for circular debt financing\nThe regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the \u201cold era of scarcity is ending\u201d, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might \u201cprove to be even more complex\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.\nIn its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.\nMeanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the \u2018Take or Pay\u2019 electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.\nNEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.\n\u201cA significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan\u2019s power system.\u201d\nThe regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.\n\u201cIt remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.\u201d\nOn the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.\nRead more:Circular debt rose Rs79bn on \u2018seasonable, operational factors\u2019: Power Division\nAt the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.\n\u201cGovernance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan\u2019s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,\u201d the NEPRA report said.\nKE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.\nIn contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.\nQESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.\nIn terms of recovery, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) was the best-placed DISCO with a recovery rate of 101.7%, followed by GEPCO and LESCO.",

It will only shift demand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will only create a false sense of security.\u201d",
      "fullText": "KARACHI: Shakil Ashfaq, President of the Bin Qasim Association of Trade and Industry (BQATI), has expressed grave concern over the continued imposition of cross-subsidy on industrial electricity tariffs, stating that this policy is directly undermining industrial productivity, discouraging investment, and eroding Pakistan\u2019s export competitiveness.\nHe noted that industrial electricity tariffs currently carry a cross-subsidy ranging from Rs 4.5 to Rs 7 per unit, adding nearly 20 percent to power costs that are already uncompetitive by regional standards. He stated that industry is no longer in a position to absorb this burden, and many industrial units are operating under extreme financial stress.\nShakil Ashfaq pointed out that despite having a broad base of small industrial units, Pakistan has failed to build and sustain large-scale industry\u2014particularly in energy-intensive sectors operating in the Bin Qasim industrial zone. He emphasised that distorted and punitive electricity pricing discourages expansion, modernization, and long-term planning, forcing industries to remain small, underutilized, or unviable.\nHe further highlighted that the number of protected consumers has increased substantially in recent years. However, instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal measures, the government has chosen to recover the cost directly from industry. He termed this approach unfair and economically damaging, noting that industry has been treated as a convenient adjustment mechanism even while it faces declining demand, rising input costs, and persistent uncertainty.\nCommenting on the Incremental Consumption Package, Shakil said the scheme suffers from serious design flaws and structural anomalies. He pointed out that industries which maintained higher electricity consumption during the reference period December 2023 to November 2024 have been declared ineligible, despite being consistent contributors to system demand.\nHe also questioned the load factors applied in the package, stating that they have no technical or regulatory basis for an incentive framework. He said these factors appear to be borrowed from theft and detection billing methodologies, which are meant for enforcement and not for incentivizing demand growth, adding that the package has therefore lost its intended purpose.\n\u201cThis design will not increase overall electricity demand,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt will only shift demand within the industrial sector, create artificial distortions, and reward behavior that has no connection to real economic productivity.\u201d\nShakil Ashfaq also challenged repeated claims by the Power Ministry regarding improvements in the performance of the power sector. He stated that if the sector has genuinely improved, a competitive industrial tariff of around 9 cents per unit should already be achievable. The continued absence of such a tariff, he said, raises serious concerns about policy direction and priorities.\nHe urged the government to immediately remove cross-subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs, correct the anomalies in the Incremental Consumption Package, and align energy policy with the national objective of industrial growth rather than short-term revenue recovery.\nHe concluded by stating that Pakistan cannot achieve export expansion, employment generation, or economic stability while systematically weakening its productive sector. Unless these structural distortions are removed, industrial confidence will continue to erode and the economy will remain trapped in stagnation.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "After years of stop-start recoveries, Large-Scale Manufacturing is now exhibiting momentum that is difficult to dismiss as episodic. November 2025 marked a decisive break from past patterns.\nYear-on-year growth of 10.37 percent was the strongest since June 2022, while the November index reading matched the highs last seen in November FY22.\nOn a cumulative basis, LSM growth for 5MFY26 stands at 6.01 percent year-on-year, with the index reading for the July to November period the highest ever recorded for this window.\nMore telling than the headline numbers is the breadth of the recovery. On a cumulative 5MFY26 basis, 16 industries are in positive territory, with only six contracting. For November alone, just four industries remained in the red, the lowest count of negative sectors since February 2022. This confirms that LSM growth is no longer being propped up by one or two outperformers, a recurring feature of earlier recoveries.\nSectoral dynamics underline this shift. Automobiles continue to anchor growth, but petroleum has emerged as the standout performer.\nOn a cumulative basis, petroleum contributed second most to overall LSM growth after automobiles, while in November alone it made the single largest contribution. Year-on-year growth of 44 percent in November reflects record-breaking production. Both petrol and high-speed diesel reached their highest-ever monthly output, pushing the petroleum index to its strongest level since May 2018.\nThe food sector is also gaining traction. The sugar season has commenced on a firmer footing compared to last year, providing an early boost to food LSM. With sugar carrying the second-highest weight in the food basket, sustained production between November and March could meaningfully lift cumulative food sector growth in the months ahead.\nAn unexpected boost in November came from the beverage sector, which despite its relatively low weight made a significant contribution to overall LSM growth. The beverage index for November 2025 was the highest ever recorded for the month, and by a wide margin, driven primarily by strong output of soft drinks and mineral water.\nTextiles remain under pressure, but this weakness is increasingly being offset by steady gains in readymade garment exports.\nWhile month-on-month fluctuations persist, year-on-year momentum remains intact, aided by a favorable base. Pharmaceuticals, by contrast, continue to underperform overall, though November did offer a bright spot.\nTablet production rebounded to a 40-month high, suggesting early signs of stabilization within a subdued sector.\nTransport-related manufacturing continues to reinforce the expansion. Motorcycle and bicycle sales reached 4-year and 6-year monthly highs, respectively, in November, aligning with broader strength across the automobile value chain. These trends are feeding directly into LSM readings and strengthening the case for durability.\nMacro conditions are now turning supportive rather than merely less restrictive. The interest rate cycle has begun to ease, energy prices are materially lower than both one year and two years ago, and incentives on incremental electricity consumption remain in place.\nTogether, these factors are translating into improved capacity utilization and sustained output gains. LSM growth is increasingly resembling a trend rather than a short-lived rebound.\nThat said, perspective remains necessary. FY22 continues to serve as the benchmark, and it remains out of reach for FY26. To match those highs, LSM growth would need to average close to 15 percent over the remaining seven months, an outcome that appears unlikely.\nEven so, the current trajectory suggests that LSM has decisively turned a corner. The damage inflicted over the past few years has been deep, but the recovery is now broader, more balanced, and materially more credible than at any point since mid-2022.",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) has requested Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to review and rationalise the existing recovery methodology for line fill financing cost and allow recovery at the actual financing rate incurred by OMCs to reduce financial pressure on the industry.\nIn a letter to Executive Director Finance Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority Altaf Hussain, Secretary General OCAC, Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi referenced Ogra letter of January 13, 2026, and the meeting held on January 14, 2026, chaired by the Chairman Ogra, wherein various issues concerning the oil industry and the oil industry\u2019s response regarding the recovery of line fill financing cost were deliberated.\nThe OCAC reiterated that the matter of line fill financing cost recovery-particularly the rate used for recovery had already been highlighted by the industry in its earlier correspondence of July 4, 2024.\nREAD MORE:Recovery through IFEM: OMC margins, digitisation targets critical: OCAC\nDespite this, the issue remains unresolved and continues to adversely impact the financial sustainability of Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).\nAccording to the industry, Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR) is widely recognised as a benchmark reference rate; however, it does not represent the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs.\nIn practice, banks extend financing to OMCs at a premium over KIBOR, typically around KIBOR plus 2percent, reflecting credit risk, tenor, and other standard banking considerations.\nAccordingly, recovery of line fill financing cost at KIBOR alone does not reflect the true and unavoidable cost being borne by the industry.\nBased on the financing levels currently incorporated in IFEM, the financial impact of this mismatch for the line fill during the period January-June 2025 un-recovered variance was Rs. 814,231,167 (approximately Rs. 814 million); (i) financing cost recovered at average KIBOR (11.07percent): Rs. 4,508,126,561; and (ii) actual financing cost at KIBOR (11.07percent) + 2percent: Rs. 5,322,357,727.\nThis un-recovered amount represents a material financing cost currently being absorbed by OMCs. In the prevailing interest-rate environment, such partial recovery is exerting significant pressure on cash flows, working capital, and the overall financial health of the industry.\nContinued non-recovery of actual costs is neither sustainable nor consistent with the principle of cost neutrality embedded in the regulatory framework.\nOCAC has emphasised that line fill is a regulatory and operational necessity, essential for ensuring uninterrupted and efficient supply of petroleum products through pipeline infrastructure.\nConsequently, the financing cost associated with line fill is legitimate, unavoidable, and directly attributable to regulatory operational compliance. Non-recognition of the KIBOR premium component; therefore, effectively results in partial disallowance of actual costs, which is not on merit and undermines fairness.\nIn this context, OCAC has submitted that Ogra-being the regulator and monitor of the oil industry\u2014has a critical role in ensuring that genuine and prudently incurred costs are fully recoverable.\nAligning the allowed financing rate with the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs, including the applicable premium over KIBOR, would restore cost neutrality, support industry viability, and help safeguard uninterrupted supply to the national economy.\nAfter explaining the issue, OCAC has requested Ogra to review and rationalise the existing recovery methodology for line fill financing cost and allow recovery at the actual financing rate incurred by OMCs. This measure would meaningfully reduce financial pressure on the industry.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is reportedly working on three proposals to reduce the industrial electricity tariff to 9 cents per kWh by eliminating cross-subsidy \u2014 one of the key demands of export-oriented industries for years,Business Recorderhas learnt from reliable sources.\nThe National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) determined the tariffs for distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs 33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs 34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26.\nFor industrial consumers, the B-2 ToU rate has been fixed at Rs 34.47/kWh, B-3 ToU at Rs 33.26/kWh, and B-4 ToU at Rs 33.04/kWh.\nThe government will notify revised tariffs after incorporating available subsidies in line with its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nLast month, the Power Division briefed the highest forum that industrial consumers are currently being charged a base variable rate of Rs 29.25 per unit against the Nepra-determined rate of Rs 23.88 per unit, effectively cross-subsidising domestic consumers by Rs 5.37 per unit.\nEliminating this cross-subsidy would require an additional budgetary allocation of Rs 160 billion per annum \u2014 Rs 131 billion for Discos and Rs 29 billion for K-Electric.\nExplaining the rationale, sources said the move would make Pakistani industry regionally competitive and encourage higher production and exports. More affordable and predictable electricity tariffs would promote higher capacity utilisation, formalisation of industrial activity, and reinvestment in existing facilities. The reform is also expected to improve power sector efficiency by reducing reliance on captive generation, strengthening grid demand, and promoting a transparent and equitable tariff structure \u2014 thereby supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation.\nBased on data from the past 50 years, the price elasticity of demand is estimated at 0.22 percent, meaning a Rs 1 per unit reduction in tariff results in additional consumption of 265 GWh. Accordingly, a Rs 5.37 per unit reduction is expected to increase industrial electricity consumption by at least 1,423 GWh. This incremental demand is projected to raise real GDP by Rs 360 billion and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 28.5 billion.\nThe overall fiscal impact of this proposal would be Rs 160 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.\nSources further noted that the power sector budget has been reduced from Rs 1,287 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs 893 billion in FY 2025-26 due to efficiency gains, and these savings should be utilised to enhance affordability and sustainability in the power sector.\nProposal 2\nAfter removal of cross-subsidy, the all-inclusive pre-tax industrial tariff would be Rs 31.34 per unit \u2014 comprising Rs 23.88 per unit variable charge, Rs 4.23 per unit fixed charge, and Rs 3.23 per unit DSS\u2014equivalent to around 11 cents per kWh (at an exchange rate of Rs 280). A further reduction of Rs 6.13 per unit would bring the final tariff down to 9 cents per kWh.\nThis would require an additional budgetary support of Rs 182 billion per annum \u2014Rs 150 billion for Discos and Rs 32 billion for K-Electric \u2014 through fiscalisation of power producers\u2019 debt, with the resulting generation cost relief ring-fenced for industrial consumers.\nIf approved, this proposal would restore industrial competitiveness, boost production and exports, and drive economic growth. Sources said reducing the final industrial tariff to 9 cents would significantly enhance the global competitiveness of Pakistan\u2019s export-oriented and energy-intensive sectors, encourage reinvestment and expansion, and reduce dependence on captive power generation. Fiscalising legacy power sector debt would separate past inefficiencies from current consumption decisions and strengthen confidence in the policy framework.\nA Rs 6.13 per unit tariff reduction is expected to increase industrial consumption by at least 1,624 GWh, raise real GDP by Rs 411 billion, and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 32.5 billion, with a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum.\nIf the first two proposals are approved, the industrial tariff would be fixed at Rs 25.21 per kWh (9 cents), requiring a total subsidy of Rs 342 billion. However, electricity consumption would increase by 3,047 GWh, real GDP would rise by Rs 771 billion, and additional tax revenue of Rs 61 billion would be generated.\nProposal 3\nThe third proposal relates to the inclusion of greenfield industries in the Grid Sustainability Package (GSP) 2025. The government has announced the GSP as a subsidy-neutral mechanism to unlock latent demand by offering electricity at the marginal cost of 8 cents per kWh for consumption above a defined baseline.\nWhile the IMF approved the GSP, it did not allow the discounted rate to apply to the entire consumption of greenfield industries. The Power Division has requested that discussions with the IMF be reopened to include greenfield industries in full, in order to ensure grid sustainability, enhance industrial competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth.\nThe Power Division believes that since the current tariff structure already ensures full recovery of fixed costs through base consumption, extending the GSP rate to the entire load of greenfield data centres, crypto-mining facilities, and copper and aluminium industries would not compromise cost recovery. IMF-approved safeguards \u2014 including a 25 percent cap on aggregate incremental consumption, semi-annual reviews, and a termination clause\u2014further mitigate fiscal and system-level risks.\nSources said these greenfield industries, particularly data centres and crypto-mining operations, have significant potential to absorb surplus power, improve system load factors, stabilise grid operations during low-demand periods, and strengthen the financial sustainability of the power sector.\nQuantitative analysis using macroeconomic indicators shows that each additional 1 GWh of electricity sales adds Rs 253 million to real GDP. Although aluminium smelting and copper refining are energy-intensive, they generate tradable output and strong local supply chains involving mining, logistics, and exports. While the economic productivity per unit of electricity is lower for data centres and crypto-mining, these sectors still contribute meaningfully to GDP growth and tax revenues.\nIf approved, this proposal would have a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faced a significant shortfall of Rs545 billion against its original target during the first half of the current fiscal year. This gap reflects massive revenue leakage in the economy, sources said.\nAccording to a study by Ipsos on tax evasion in five sectors, over Rs1 trillion is lost annually to tax evasion and smuggling across key sectors. A strategic focus on enforcement and documentation could provide the fiscal space needed to stabilize the economy without further burdening compliant taxpayers or the formal business community.\nThe \u201cshadow economy\u201d has become the primary hurdle for economic recovery. The real estate sector alone accounts for approximately Rs500 billion in annual tax losses, while illicit tobacco trade\u2014comprising smuggled and non-tax-paid cigarettes costs the national exchequer another Rs310 billion. Other major industries, including tyres, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, and tea, collectively account for over Rs200 billion in additional evasion, the sources said.\nMacroeconomic analyst Osama Siddiqui said because these sectors operate largely outside the documented net, fiscal pressure is unfairly shifted onto a small pool of compliant taxpayers. This creates a vicious cycle where high taxes further incentivize evasion and hinder commercial growth.\nREAD MORE:FBR\u2019s \u2018revolution\u2019: future of Pakistan\u2019s economic sovereignty\nSiddiqui said that the solution lies in targeted enforcement rather than higher tax rates. \u201cTo meet these tax targets, the government must plug loopholes that lead to tax leakages and intensify targeted enforcement efforts,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe state should focus on bringing the undocumented sector into the tax net and eliminating smuggling rather than solely relying on existing resources. The ineffective implementation of Track & Trace systems across various industries highlights a lack of government resolve in curbing illicit trade.\u201d\nHe urged that the path to fiscal sustainability depends on shifting strategy from taxing the \u201calready taxed\u201d to capturing the \u201cuntaxed\u201d.

      "fullText": "NEPRA\u2019s FY26 tariff decision shows a puzzling divergence between consumer classification, electricity consumption, and solar capacity estimates. On the residential side, the number of protected consumers rises to 21.5 million from 17 million in the government motion.\nThe largest increase is in the 101\u2013200 kWh slab, now counting 12.53 million consumers. Total consumption for this slab remains 3.89 billion kWh, translating to about 26 kWh per household per month. This is far below the lower bound of the slab and suggests administrative reclassification or policy-driven inflation rather than actual usage.\nHouseholds in the 1\u2013100 kWh category average 163 kWh per month, consistent with low-consumption behavior. The mismatch compresses per-consumer allocations and raises questions about fairness in subsidy targeting.\nOn the commercial front, numbers are more consistent. Nepra lists 3.52 million commercial consumers, up from 2.97 million in the motion.\nTotal consumption remains unchanged. This aligns with 3.5 million consumers recorded in the July 2025 base tariff, suggesting a routine reconciliation of records. The contrast shows that residential slab anomalies are likely due to methodology or policy choices rather than systemic errors.\nThe decision also addresses solarization. It cites a Power Planning & Monitoring Company (PPMC) report estimating 12,629 MW of off-grid solar capacity, in addition to 6,539 MW of net-metered installations, for a total of nearly 19,000 MW.\nThe report is not public, and the cut-off date is unclear. Import data suggests that cumulative solar panel imports already amount to around 50,000 MW, far higher than the official estimate.\nIt is also unclear whether behind-the-meter residential or commercial solar is included. Nepra assumes this capacity will generate nearly 30 billion kWh outside the grid, based on 4.5 hours of daily irradiation, and estimates the impact on base tariffs at Rs3.5 per unit.\nThe key risk is that underestimating off-grid and behind-the-meter solar could jeopardize demand-side planning and grid management. If actual capacity is far higher than official estimates, the base tariff and subsidy framework may fail to reflect true consumption patterns, distorting financial planning and resource allocation.\nThe anomalies in residential slabs and the underestimation of solar capacity point to deeper challenges in Pakistan\u2019s electricity planning. Inflated consumer counts in higher protected slabs dilute actual subsidy coverage.\nAt the same time, official off-grid and behind-the-meter solar estimates fall far short of what import data suggest. This misalignment risks distorting tariff calculations, weakening demand-side management, and complicating grid operations.\nWithout clear methodology and public access to underlying data, policy decisions may be built on assumptions that do not reflect reality, leaving households, utilities, and planners exposed to unforeseen costs and operational stress.",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: President of the SITE Association of Industry (SAI), Ahmed Azeem Alvi has expressed serious concern over the continued burden of cross subsidy imposed on industrial electricity tariffs, stating that this policy is weakening industrial viability and discouraging scale, investment, and formal growth.\nHe stated that industrial tariffs are currently carrying a cross subsidy of Rs4.5 to Rs7 per unit, adding nearly 20 percent extra cost to electricity that is already uncompetitive. According to him, industry is barely able to carry its own cost structure and this additional burden has pushed many units to the brink.\nAhmed Azeem Alvi pointed out that while Pakistan has a large number of small industrial units, the country has failed to establish and retain large scale industry, largely due to distorted energy pricing.\nHe said policies that penalize consumption and expansion naturally prevent industries from growing in size and efficiency.\nHe further noted that the number of protected consumers has increased sharply in recent years, yet instead of supporting them through fiscal space, the government is using industry as a balancing tool.\nThis approach, he said, is neither sustainable nor fair, especially when industry already pays in full and on time.\nCommenting on the Incremental Consumption Package, Alvi stated that the scheme is fundamentally flawed and internally inconsistent. Industries that consumed higher electricity during the reference period from December 2023 to November 2024 have been rendered ineligible, even though they represent stable and genuine demand.\nSAI President highlighted that the load factors applied in the package have no regulatory or technical basis for incremental demand creation and appear to have been lifted from theft and detection billing frameworks meant for enforcement, not incentives. He said this anomaly has completely diluted the purpose of the package.\n\u201cAs designed, the package will not increase demand,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt will only cause demand shifting within industry, creating artificial winners and losers and further distorting consumption patterns.\u201d\nAhmed Azeem Alvi also questioned repeated claims by the Power Ministry regarding improved performance, stating that if the sector has improved, a competitive industrial tariff of around 9 cents per unit should already have been achievable. The absence of such a tariff, he said, exposes the gap between claims and ground realities.\nHe urged the government to immediately remove cross subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs, withdraw the flawed incremental package in its present form, and redesign incentives on transparent and rational principles.\nHe states that industrial revival, export growth, and employment generation cannot be achieved by penalizing consumption and rewarding inefficiency. Without correcting these structural distortions, policy announcements will continue to fail in delivering real economic outcomes.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

The message remains straightforward: rooftop solar is a public good, but it is also part of a shared system. The writer has served at the Energy Conservation Fund, NEECA. ile sowing tomorrow\u2019s technical, fiscal, and environmental challenges.",
      "fullText": "Pakistan\u2019s rooftop solar revolution has delivered cleaner power at record speed, but without urgent policy resets, it risks destabilising the very grid it depends on. The scale and speed of adoption have exposed structural faults in a system designed for one-way power flows from large, centralized generators. While policy responses are now emerging, failure to align incentives with system realities could still trade short-term gains for long-term grid fragmentation and inequity.\nThe numbers are eye-opening. With over 50 GW of solar panels imported into Pakistan in just five years, the country has witnessed one of the fastest market-driven clean energy transitions in the region. This surge has dramatically reshaped daytime electricity demand while leaving evening peaks largely unchanged, creating the classic \u201cduck curve\u201d that forces utilities to maintain costly standby capacity.\nAt the same time, a rapid influx of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is emerging alongside rooftop solar installations. Industrial and commercial consumers, in particular, are increasingly deploying BESS to manage load-shedding, avoid peak tariffs, and insulate operations from grid volatility.\nWhile this shift can improve reliability and flatten demand peaks, its system-wide impacts on load forecasting, tariff recovery, grid operations, safety standards, and end-of-life management have yet to be fully assessed or reflected in regulation.\nYet the financing behind this transformation remains largely opaque. The solar-and-storage boom is being driven primarily by households and firms with access to upfront capital, while lower-income consumers remain effectively locked out of the transition. As a result, the benefits of reduced bills, energy autonomy, and resilience accrue disproportionately to better-capitalized users, even as the fixed costs of maintaining the grid are increasingly borne by consumers with no access to distributed generation.\nThe release of draft revisions to the NEPRA (Prosumer) Regulations, 2025 reflects an emerging regulatory consensus that Pakistan\u2019s rooftop solar expansion is beginning to strain grid operations and cost recovery. The regulations codify a shift from net metering to net billing, replacing retail-rate compensation with credits based on the national average energy purchase price. This change recognizes that exported rooftop electricity has a system value distinct from retail consumption and must be priced accordingly.\nThat change in demand has material consequences for the financing of the power system. Transmission and distribution networks, capacity charges, and system-balancing services represent largely fixed or lumpy costs; they do not shrink in proportion to the kilowatt-hours an individual household consumes.\nWhen affluent consumers install rooftop PV and export surplus during daylight hours, they reduce their bills but continue to rely on the same wires, substations, and balancing services every evening. The residual cost must therefore be recovered from a shrinking pool of consumers, many of whom cannot afford distributed generation.\nThe new prosumer regulations partially address this imbalance by delinking export compensation from retail tariffs. However, they stop short of introducing explicit grid-access or capacity charges. As a result, fixed network costs remain socialized across non-solar consumers, leaving unresolved the equity concerns that accompany rapid rooftop adoption.\nREAD MORE:Pakistan\u2019s solar rush unlocked $17-19bn in private investment in 8 years: study\nRecognizing technical constraints, the regulations also empower distribution companies to refuse new connections where distributed generation capacity reaches 80% of a transformer\u2019s rated capacity, and to require load-flow studies for larger installations. These safeguards implicitly validate the concern that unmanaged rooftop growth can overload local networks, reinforcing the need for planning tools that anticipate not react to distributed generation impacts.\nThe revised framework reflects a broader fiscal reality. Pakistan\u2019s power sector continues to carry legacy liabilities and circular debt, and the federal government has recently relied on substantial financing packages to stabilize sector finances. In this context, policies that further erode distribution company revenues without addressing cost recovery risk deepening fiscal stress and political backlash.\nNone of this should be read as an argument against rooftop solar. Distributed PV reduces fuel imports, cuts emissions, and improves resilience. The challenge is no longer whether rooftop solar should grow, but how it should be integrated so that private benefits do not undermine collective infrastructure.\nTo that end, three pragmatic policy directions remain essential.\nFirst, remuneration must be aligned with system value through the continued rollout of net billing combined with time-of-use tariffs. Net billing alone reduces regressive cross-subsidies, but without temporal price signals it cannot address the mismatch between daytime exports and evening demand.\nSecond, transparent and modest grid-access or capacity charges should be introduced to ensure all connected users contribute fairly to fixed network costs. Such charges should be carefully designed, with exemptions or lifeline thresholds for low-income consumers, to avoid undermining energy access while preventing cost shifting from large exporters to vulnerable households.\nThird, incentives must pivot toward storage and demand-side management. Battery prices have fallen sharply, yet the current regulatory framework remains silent on encouraging hybrid solar-plus-storage systems or compensating prosumers for providing grid services. Without these incentives, the duck curve will persist, merely flattened rather than resolved.\nThe regulations provide procedural clarity through defined timelines and renewable five-year agreements, but the ability to revise export rates during the agreement term introduces uncertainty for investors. Predictable transition pathways rather than discretionary revisions will be critical to channeling investment toward grid-friendly technologies such as storage, smart inverters, and managed electric-vehicle charging.\nThese reforms are not unprecedented. Mature markets in Europe and North America have moved away from flat retail net metering toward net billing, dynamic tariffs, and grid-usage fees while preserving strong solar uptake. Citizen empowerment was not extinguished; it was redirected into models that are technically sound and economically sustainable.\nFor distribution companies, the imperative is to engage constructively with regulators and consumers to implement reforms that are evidence-based, transparent, and phased. Sudden reversals or opaque policymaking invite uncertainty and backlash; predictable transitions mobilize investment in storage, smart meters, and grid-edge services that benefit all users.\nFor consumers, the message remains straightforward: rooftop solar is a public good, but it is also part of a shared system. Individual energy independence should not erode the collective infrastructure that guarantees supply for everyone.\nOne critical issue still waiting in the wings is the end-of-life management of solar panels. With an average lifespan of 25-30 years, today\u2019s installations will become tomorrow\u2019s waste stream. The absence of any provision for environmentally sound disposal, recycling, or extended producer responsibility in the current regulatory framework risks replacing fuel imports with unmanaged solar waste undermining the sustainability narrative that solar power promises.\nPakistan\u2019s new prosumer regulations mark a necessary evolution from unpriced exports toward system-aware compensation. But regulation alone is not reform. Without complementary measures on storage, grid-access pricing, demand management, and lifecycle responsibility, the country risks solving yesterday\u2019s tariff problem while sowing tomorrow\u2019s technical, fiscal, and environmental challenges.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nAsad Mahmood\nThe writer has served at the Energy Conservation Fund, NEECA.

      "fullText": "KARACHI: Referring to a news item appearing in a section of press, Acting President Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Raza expressed serious concern and strong opposition to the proposed amendments to the Nepra Act, 1997 and the Electricity Act, 1910, which indicated that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) may be placed under the administrative control of the Power Division.\nMuhammad Raza stated that the proposed amendments effectively strike at the very foundation of regulatory independence, which is a universally accepted principle for ensuring transparency, predictability, and credibility in utility regulation.\nHe cautioned that placing Nepra under the direct influence of an executive ministry would compromise its ability to make impartial, technically sound, and cost-reflective decisions, thereby weakening confidence in Pakistan\u2019s power sector governance framework.\nHe pointed out that independent regulators are established precisely to act as neutral arbiters between the government, utilities, investors, and consumers.\nAny move that transforms Nepra into a subordinate body of the Power Division would not only undermine its authority but also raise serious concerns about politicisation of tariff determinations and regulatory decisions, which must remain insulated from short-term administrative or political pressures.\nHe warned that such amendments could severely damage investor confidence at a time when Pakistan desperately needs private sector participation to address chronic inefficiencies, mounting circular debt, and persistent capacity payment issues in the power sector.\nHe emphasised that investors require regulatory certainty and independence, and any perception of executive interference would deter fresh investment and increase the cost of capital for ongoing and future projects.\nMuhammad Raza further stated that weakening Nepra\u2019s autonomy would ultimately harm industrial and commercial consumers, who already face uncompetitive electricity tariffs and unreliable supply.\nAn independent regulator is essential to ensure fair scrutiny of costs, efficiency benchmarks, and service standards, whereas an administratively controlled regulator may be compelled to prioritise short-term fiscal or political considerations over long-term sector sustainability and consumer protection.\nHe also questioned the rationale behind the proposed amendments, noting that policy disagreements between a regulator and a ministry should be resolved through structured dialogue and institutional mechanisms, not by curtailing the regulator\u2019s independence.\nSuch an approach, he said, sets a dangerous precedent and reverses years of reform efforts aimed at strengthening governance and accountability in the power sector.\nRaza urged the government to immediately reconsider the proposed amendments and initiate comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders, including chambers of commerce, industry representatives, energy experts, and consumer bodies.\nHe stressed that Pakistan\u2019s economic revival depends on transparent, credible, and independent institutions, and that weakening Nepra would be a regressive step with long-term negative consequences for the economy.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "Pakistan is the 5th most populous country having 64 percent of its population under the age of 30. It is often being pitched as a land of opportunities. However, despite an expanding market, a youthful workforce and strategic location, the country has not been able to attract enough investment, whether domestic and foreign.\nA lot of literature has highlighted various economic issues as the main culprits like interest rate, exchange rate, inflation, low economic growth, etc. but, there are some other issues, which are affecting investment adversely in the country. When other countries are moving upward, Pakistan\u2019s investment is sliding downward.\nBack in 1975, the investment to GDP ratio of Pakistan was approximately 17 percent. After 50 years, it has decreased to 13.1 percent, which is a serious concern and needs proper pondering of policy makers.\nBeside weak domestic investment, the country\u2019s performance of attracting FDI is also lackluster. Back in 1990s, Pakistan used to attract more FDIs than India, but the equation has flipped completely. For example, in 1992, Pakistan attracted USD 336.5 million in FDI, while India attracted only USD 276.5 million. Now the trajectory has completely changed; in 2024, Pakistan only managed USD 2.7 billion, while India attracted USD 27.1 billion, which is almost 13 times higher.\nIn 2022, India attracted USD 50 billion FDI, while Pakistan has just USD 1.46 billion. Why has this huge divergence occurred? Various initiatives were taken like the Board of Investment, One Window Operation, and most recently the establishment of SIFC, but to no avail. Simply, policies are not feasible to attract the investors.\nFor instance, take the corporate tax rate, which is extremely high and can reach 65 percent. An investor wants profit, not punishment for investing. The standard corporate base rate is 29 percent and reaches up to 44 percent for some sectors. Then there are 10 percent super tax, 2 percent worker welfare fund, and 5 percent worker participation fund, summing up to 50 percent.\nAlso add 15 percent income tax of the dividends; the tax rate reaches 65 percent. Why on the earth will someone invest with such a higher tax rate? Why an investor will not invest in Dubai where the corporate tax rate is only 9 percent when income is above a threshold otherwise 0 percent tax? However, this seems a small problem as compared to the other issues, which are discouraging investors.\nThe security situation is one of them. It has not improved for decades. The country ranked second on the Global Terrorism Index and the attacks are not receding. How is one supposed to invest in such situation? Even domestic investors have shifted their capital to safe havens.\nSimilarly, the law and order situation in the country is also forcing investors to move to safer avenues.\nPolitical instability is another major hurdle. Political parties are after one another driven by vendetta and not by national interest. There is no long-term political vision for the betterment of the country.\nCitizens witness strikes, lockdowns and closure of main roads for weeks, affecting businesses adversely. In developed democracies, there are consistencies of policy regardless whichever party is in the government. Regrettably, the case is different in Pakistan.\nLikewise, regulatory burdens and red tape are another nightmare. Instead of facilitation, regulations are often used as a tool of control. Compliance is very time consuming. If someone wants to install an electricity or gas connection, he has to wait for months. If one wants faster service, then one has to grease the palm of the authorities.\nSimilarly, opening a bank account is a herculean task, providing endless documents like utility bills, proof of income and so on. Company registration takes even more long and hectic documentation. Why would someone put his hard earned money in a process full of hurdles? On top of that, repatriating money or profit is also a struggle.\nThe weak judicial system is often ignored while discussing the investment issue. A strong judicial system provides confidence to investors that his interest cannot be harmed by anyone. Pakistan judicial system is ranked 129 out of 142 on the World Justice Project. There is no quick mechanism for dispute resolution.\nThe courts are overburdened and inefficient having more than 2.3 million backlog of cases. A commercial dispute takes years and sometime even decades. If someone wants to trouble you, he will just file a fabricated case and it will take years to prove that there is nothing substantial behind it.\nFor many domestic investors, the fear of political victimization combined with the lack of judicial protection discourages them to invest.\nThen there are issues of infrastructure and policy inconsistency. Investors face electricity and power outages along with very high cost. To cope, many businesses have installed solar for power generation and every year there is a debate to tax their own generation.\nThe lack of policy inconsistency makes the situation further exacerbated. Many investors fear that today\u2019s rules will not survive the next budget. In such unpredictability, no one is ready to invest in the country.\nTo cut the long story short, if Pakistan wants high investment, it has to make some amends. Otherwise, increasing investment will be a far cry in the wilderness.\nPakistan must address its governance problem, improve its law and order situation, strengthen its judicial system, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, improve policy consistency and cool down the political temperature. Then it will boost the morale of investors to invest in the country. Instead of higher taxes, the country needs to incentivize investors so that productivity can rise. Without transparent tax system, regulatory regime, protection of rights, contract enforcement, sustainable macro policy and reliable infrastructure, Pakistan will be bypassed by the serious investors.\nThe country cannot afford the outflow of investors like the recent exit of Procter & Gamble (P&G), Shell, Telenor, Pfizer, Bayer, Total Energies, Uber, Careem, and Microsoft.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nWajid Islam\nThe writer is a Research Economist at the Pakistan institute of development economics (PIDE), Islamabad.

He said agreements had been signed with American and Chinese companies to explore untapped resources in Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\nThe prime minister said Pakistan was also moving rapidly in emerging fields such as information technology, artificial intelligence and crypto, describing the country\u2019s large youth population as both a challenge and a major opportunity.\nHe said federal and provincial governments were jointly implementing programmes to equip young people with vocational and technical skills, citing the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), whose initiatives undergo third-party audits and international certification to help youth secure employment abroad.\nOn foreign relations, Shehbaz said Pakistan enjoyed strong economic ties with China and was expanding cooperation with the United States in areas including mining, minerals, counterterrorism and technology.\nHe also highlighted the government\u2019s push for transparent privatisation, including Pakistan International Airlines, and said further privatisation and outsourcing were planned in airports, power distribution companies and transmission infrastructure.\nReferring to the IMF programme, the prime minister said Pakistan had implemented strict conditions \u201cin letter and spirit,\u201d adding that the Fund was now citing Pakistan as a success story among developing countries.\nOn structural reforms, he said the government had taken politically difficult decisions to shut down loss-making state entities, including Utility Stores Corporation, PASSCO and the Pakistan Public Works Department, resulting in savings of billions of rupees despite resistance from vested interests.\n\u201cWe are at a point where Pakistan is about to take off,\u201d Shehbaz said, stressing that unity, transparency and sustained reforms were essential to achieving long-term economic growth and prosperity.",

The Committee further estimated that economy has posted a growth of 3.71 percent during first quarter (Q1) of fiscal year 2025-26.\nThe Fund stated that global growth is projected to remain resilient at 3.3 percent in 2026 and at 3.2 percent in 2027: rates similar to the estimated 3.3 percent outturn in 2025.\nThe forecast marks a small upward revision for 2026 and no change for 2027 compared with that in the October 2025 WEO. This steady performance on the surface results from the balancing of divergent forces. Headwinds from shifting trade policies are offset by tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), more so in North America and Asia than in other regions, as well as fiscal and monetary support, broadly accommodative financial conditions, and adaptability of the private sector.\nGlobal headline inflation is expected to decline from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2025 to 3.8 percent in 2026 and further to 3.4 percent in 2027.\nThe inflation projections are also broadly unchanged from those in October and envisage inflation returning to target more gradually in the United States than in other large economies.\nRisks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. Re-evaluation of productivity growth expectations about AI could lead to a decline in investment and trigger an abrupt financial market correction, spreading from AI-linked companies to other segments and eroding household wealth.\nTrade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity. Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices.\nLarger fiscal deficits and high public debt could put pressure on long-term interest rates and, in turn, on broader financial conditions.\nOn the upside, activity could be further lifted by AI-related investment and eventually transform into sustainable growth if faster AI adoption translates into strong productivity gains and increased business dynamism. Activity could also be supported by a sustained easing in trade tensions.\nPolicies to foster stability and sustainably lift medium-term growth prospects require a keen focus on restoring fiscal buffers, preserving price and financial stability, reducing uncertainty, and implementing structural reforms without further delay.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

He shared that Pakistan has made significant progress by reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from 75 percent to 70 percent, achieving a primary surplus and restoring fiscal balance through responsible economic management.\nHe added that inflation in Pakistan has declined sharply from a peak of 38 percent to single digits, while the policy rate has been reduced from over 22 percent to 10.5 percent, placing the country on the favourable side of the interest rate cycle.\nSenator Aurangzeb highlighted ongoing debt management reforms, including liability management operations, debt buybacks and efforts to create value in domestic markets.\nHe also announced that Pakistan is set to enter the Chinese capital market with its inaugural Panda bond, structured as a green bond, reflecting the country\u2019s commitment to sustainable and climate-resilient financing.\nAddressing the issue of climate change, the Minister stated that for Pakistan and other vulnerable emerging economies, climate risks are real, recurring and economically disruptive.\nHe noted that building fiscal buffers has enabled Pakistan to respond to recent floods through domestic resources rather than international emergency appeals, underscoring the importance of fiscal resilience in the face of exogenous shocks.\nHe further highlighted the role of public-private partnerships and capital markets in financing adaptation and development projects, citing the successful closure of Pakistan\u2019s largest-ever syndicated financing of approximately USD 3.6 billion for a major copper mining project.\nThe project, he noted, is expected to generate around USD 2.8 billion in exports annually from 2028, significantly strengthening Pakistan\u2019s export base and supporting global energy transition needs.\nResponding to a question from the audience on technology funding and the new economy, Senator Aurangzeb emphasized Pakistan\u2019s strong potential in IT, freelancing and digital services, noting recent growth in IT exports and ongoing investments in skills development, blockchain and emerging technologies.\nHe reiterated that access to funding is not the core challenge; rather, capacity building, prioritization and effective execution are critical to translating opportunities into sustainable growth.\nConcluding his remarks, the Minister stated that responsible fiscal management, strategic use of debt, investment in the new economy and climate resilience are central to Pakistan\u2019s growth strategy, adding that \u201cit is not about the availability of debt or funding, but how wisely and effectively it is steered to create long-term economic value.\u201d\nThe panel discussion was hosted and moderated by Joumanna Bercetche, Anchor, Bloomberg News, and featured leading global financial and investment figures, including Anne Walsh, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Guggenheim Partners; Ronald P.

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) was told on Friday that the federation and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), aggrieved by a series of judgments passed by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) concerning matters related to Section 4-C of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, had filed several intra-court appeals before the IHC.\nA three-judge bench of the FCC, headed by Chief Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan heard the FBR appeals against the judgments of Sindh, Lahore and Islamabad high courts regarding levy of Super Tax under Section 4C, inserted in the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001 through Finance Act 2022.\nHafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, representing the Secretary Revenue Division, informed the bench that the preliminary objections raised by the taxpayer-respondents regarding the alleged non-maintainability of the petitions were wholly misconceived, legally untenable, and contrary to the constitutional and statutory framework.\nREAD MORE:FCC urged to rule: Charge applicable to each \u2018block\u2019 must be governed by law in force on last day\nHe said these appeals were subsequently transferred, under Article 186A of the Constitution to the constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and are presently pending before the FCC for final adjudication due to 27th Constitutional Amendment.\nDuring the proceedings, Khokhar, providing further clarification on the constitutional framework, emphasised that Article 99 of the Constitution explicitly governs the conduct of executive business within the federation.\nHe pointed out that the article mandates that such business must be transacted in strict adherence to the Rules of Business, 1973, underscoring the importance of procedural compliance in the functioning of the executive branch.\nThe counsel for Secretary Revenue Division argued that under Rule 14A read with Entry 35 of Schedule II of the Rules of Business, 1973, the Revenue Division and FBR are exclusively entrusted with matters pertaining to taxation, fiscal policy, administration of tax laws, and the protection of federal revenue.\nConsequently, the institution, prosecution, and defence of revenue litigation fall squarely within the constitutional domain of the Revenue Division and constitute acts of the federation carried out through a constitutionally designated Division.\nHe further said that in light of the amendments made to the Rules of Business, 1973, consultation with the Ministry of Law and Justice or the Office of the Attorney General is no longer mandatory for the institution or defence of revenue matters.\nHe further clarified that the subject of revenue litigation is explicitly excluded from Entry 21 of Schedule II of the Rules of Business. This exclusion, he argued, grants the Revenue Division and the FBR full autonomy in handling fiscal and taxation matters. As such, the FBR is not required to seek prior approval or consultation for such litigation, thereby affirming its independent authority in these matters.\nHe emphasized that once a subject is allocated to a Division under the Allocation of Business, Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules of Business, 1973, fully empower that Division to take all necessary executive actions to give effect to the law governing that subject, including the initiation, prosecution, and defence of legal proceedings. Any insistence on mandatory consultation, he argued, would defeat the very object of the amendments and undermine the efficiency of fiscal governance.\nKhokhar further submitted that the FBR, being an attached department of the Revenue Division as per schedule 3 of the Rules of Business, 1973, derives its authority from both the constitutional framework and statutory enactments, including the Federal Board of Revenue Act, 2007, therefore all acts performed by the FBR and its officers in revenue litigation, constitute acts of the federation itself and enjoy a strong presumption of legality.\nHe maintained that the superior courts have consistently held that where executive authority flows directly from the Constitution and the Rules of Business, objections based on an alleged lack of authorization are devoid of merit unless a clear statutory prohibition is demonstrated.\nHe stressed that fiscal governance and the protection of public revenue cannot be frustrated by hyper-technical objections, particularly when statutory remedies are pursued in good faith within the constitutional framework.\nKhokhar will make his further submissions on Monday.\nEarlier, Asma Hamid argued that the taxpayers in their respective high courts have made the relevant Inland Revenue Commissioners party, but when they filed petitions before the IHC, then they also cited federation as respondent.\nJustice Amin remarked that the taxpayer lawyers\u2019 main objection is that the federation only can file appeals when the federal legislation is set aside by the High Courts, and not in case of issuance of notices.\nAsma responded that all the high courts upheld the vires of Sections 4B and 4C, adding that the Supreme Court bench in its March 2023 leave grant order directed the taxpayers to pay 50 percent amount regarding the Super Tax.\nAsma, continuing her arguments, noted that no taxpayer had raised any challenge against the Sindh High Court\u2019s ruling, which had declared Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance intra vires and applicable from 2022. She concluded by stating that she would present her final submissions on Monday.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "LAHORE: Pakistan can still achieve its ambitious tax collection targets if the government takes decisive action against illicit trade. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faced a significant shortfall of Rs545 billion against its original target during the first half of the current fiscal year. This gap reflects massive revenue leakage in the economy, sources said.\nAccording to a study by Ipsos on tax evasion in five sectors, over Rs1 trillion is lost annually to tax evasion and smuggling across key sectors. A strategic focus on enforcement and documentation could provide the fiscal space needed to stabilize the economy without further burdening compliant taxpayers or the formal business community.\nThe \u201cshadow economy\u201d has become the primary hurdle for economic recovery. The real estate sector alone accounts for approximately Rs500 billion in annual tax losses, while illicit tobacco trade\u2014comprising smuggled and non-tax-paid cigarettes costs the national exchequer another Rs310 billion. Other major industries, including tyres, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, and tea, collectively account for over Rs200 billion in additional evasion, the sources said.\nMacroeconomic analyst Osama Siddiqui said because these sectors operate largely outside the documented net, fiscal pressure is unfairly shifted onto a small pool of compliant taxpayers. This creates a vicious cycle where high taxes further incentivize evasion and hinder commercial growth.\nREAD MORE:FBR\u2019s \u2018revolution\u2019: future of Pakistan\u2019s economic sovereignty\nSiddiqui said that the solution lies in targeted enforcement rather than higher tax rates. \u201cTo meet these tax targets, the government must plug loopholes that lead to tax leakages and intensify targeted enforcement efforts,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe state should focus on bringing the undocumented sector into the tax net and eliminating smuggling rather than solely relying on existing resources. The ineffective implementation of Track & Trace systems across various industries highlights a lack of government resolve in curbing illicit trade.\u201d\nHe urged that the path to fiscal sustainability depends on shifting strategy from taxing the \u201calready taxed\u201d to capturing the \u201cuntaxed\u201d. Strengthening regulatory enforcement and eliminating illicit trade networks are essential steps to ensure tax targets are met through growth and equity rather than emergency measures, he said.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) was urged to rule that, although a Special Tax Year is identified by reference to the normal tax year in which it ends, the charge applicable to each \u201cblock\u201d must be governed by the law in force on the last day of the respective block.\nA three-judge bench of the FCC, headed by Chief Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, on Monday heard appeals filed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) against judgments of the Sindh, Lahore, and Islamabad High Courts concerning the levy of Super Tax under Section 4C, inserted into the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001 through the Finance Act, 2021.\nAdvocate Adnan Haider, representing Trans World Associates, submitted that the split of the charge is not only necessary but also more equitable, as tax rates almost invariably change on the first day of the second block with the announcement of a new budget.\nREAD MORE:Super Tax levy: FCC urged to take into consideration 27th Amendment, other factors\nHe argued that this approach would place special tax year holders on par with normal tax year holders, as both would know in advance which tax rates apply to their earnings, and their tax liability would crystallize on the last day of the relevant block.\nHaider contended that under Section 74(1) of the ITO, a tax year comprises 12 months, while Section 74(2) provides that a special tax year may differ from a normal tax year (which corresponds to a financial year) and is denoted by the normal tax year in which its last day falls. He explained that his client follows the calendar year (January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021), which is denoted as Tax Year 2022.\nHe emphasized that, in the present matter, three six-month blocks are relevant for a Special Tax Year: the first block (January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021), which falls in Financial Year 2021 and is not subject to Section 4C of the ITO, 2001; the second block (July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021), which falls in Financial Year 2022 and to which Section 4C was retrospectively applied; and the third block (January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022), which also falls in Financial Year 2022 and is similarly subject to retrospective application of Section 4C.\nHaider submitted that FBR\u2019s counsel, Asma Hamid, relied on Lotte Akhtar (2011 PTD 2229) to argue that the levy imposed during the third block is chargeable even for the period falling within the first block in the case of a special tax year holder, despite the taxpayer\u2019s accounts having closed at the end of the second block.\nHe contended that this interpretation would unlawfully expand a special tax year from 12 months to 18 months. Such an interpretation, he argued, would seriously prejudice special tax year holders and effectively convert Section 74(2) of the ITO, 2001 from a machinery provision into a charging provision, which it is not.\nThe taxpayer\u2019s counsel further argued that the conflicting interpretations adopted by the High Courts not only make an 18-month period (three six-month blocks) relevant for special tax year holders but also cause prejudice.\nHe explained that when a charge is imposed in the third block, tax is extracted from special tax year holders even for the first block; however, when a benefit is granted in the third block, it is denied to special tax year holders on the ground that their accounting year had already ended with the close of the second block.\nHaider stated that his client had already paid super tax for the first two blocks of its Special Tax Year 2022.\nHe added that after the Islamabad High Court read down Section 4C of the ITO in Fauji Fertilizer, the petitioner approached the IHC seeking a refund. However, the High Court declined to order a refund and directed the taxpayer to avail departmental remedies.\nHe maintained that the petitioner was forced to bear the burden of super tax for the first block, which falls in Financial Year 2021, when Section 4C of the ITO, 2001 was not in force. In contrast, taxpayers following a normal tax year were not subjected to super tax for that period\u2014and rightly so.\nFarogh Naseem and Adnan Haider have concluded their arguments. From today (Tuesday), Ahmed Jamal Sukhera is scheduled to present his arguments.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: Pakistan\u2019s tax system is once again being presented as standing at the threshold of reform. The Tax Policy Office\u2019s invitation to the business community to submit proposals for Budget 2026\u201327 is framed as a turning point: a move away from short-term revenue pressures, toward consistency, economic value, and structured stakeholder engagement.\nThe institutional signal is deliberate. Tax policy formulation has been formally separated from tax administration, relocated from the Federal Board of Revenue to the Ministry of Finance. In theory, this distinction matters.\nWhat undermines the claim is not scepticism about reform, but the state\u2019s own behaviour.\nAt the same time that consultation is being emphasised, the government remains locked in a dispute with petroleum exploration and production companies over the application of Super Tax in excess of the fiscal caps embedded in petroleum concession agreements. These agreements are not discretionary incentives. They are statutory contracts, backed by law, designed to provide fiscal stability in a sector characterised by high risk, long gestation, and capital intensity.\nThe Islamabad High Court has already ruled that Super Tax cannot be applied beyond the thresholds stipulated in those agreements. Yet the matter remains unresolved, and the possibility of international arbitration has been openly raised.\nThis juxtaposition exposes a deeper contradiction in Pakistan\u2019s fiscal governance. A tax system cannot credibly claim to be predictable, value-based, and consultative while simultaneously contesting the enforceability of its own legally binding commitments.\nPolicy consistency is not a matter of intent. It is revealed through adherence to rules when they become inconvenient.\nThe Super Tax episode is not an isolated dispute. It reflects a recurring instinct within the fiscal system: the treatment of taxation as a revenue extraction tool rather than as economic architecture. Periods of stress are routinely framed as exceptional moments that justify departures from established commitments. Temporary levies become semi-permanent. Emergency logic becomes normalised. Legal certainty becomes conditional.\nThis instinct sits uneasily with the language now being used by the Tax Policy Office. Claims that taxation will be guided by economic value rather than short-term exigency are difficult to reconcile with a willingness to override contractually agreed tax caps in pursuit of incremental revenue.\nArbitration risk, reputational damage, and higher future financing costs are treated as abstract concerns, rather than as real economic costs with long-term consequences.\nThe implications extend beyond the oil and gas sector. If fiscal terms explicitly protected by statute can be reopened retroactively, the signal to investors across sectors is unambiguous. Today\u2019s framework offers no assurance against tomorrow\u2019s revision.\nConsultation may occur, but durability is not guaranteed. In such an environment, engagement becomes transactional rather than constructive, and proposals are shaped as defensive lobbying exercises rather than contributions to systemic reform.\nThe invocation of national priorities only sharpens the tension. Export competitiveness, industrial expansion, digital transformation, and energy security all depend on long-horizon investment and contractual confidence. These objectives cannot be advanced through a tax regime that relies on layered withholding, ad hoc surcharges, and retrospective reinterpretation of agreed terms. Growth does not emerge from consultation alone. It follows from credibility.\nThe institutional separation of tax policy from tax administration was long overdue.\nIn mature systems, it allows policy to be designed with economic coherence rather than enforcement convenience. But separation, by itself, does not guarantee reform. Its value depends on whether the new policy centre can impose discipline on the state\u2019s own impulses, resist short-term revenue pressures, and internalise the full economic cost of policy instability.\nThat test is already in progress. The Super Tax dispute presents a clear, observable case where legal clarity, economic logic, and long-term interest align. How the government resolves it, will matter far more than how many proposals are submitted in response to a consultation notice.\nPakistan\u2019s tax problem is not a shortage of ideas. It is a shortage of commitment to rules. Until policy credibility is restored through consistent behaviour, consultation will remain an exercise in reassurance rather than reform. The distinction is not procedural. It is foundational.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Tax Ombudsman (FTO) in a landmark order has taken serious exception to the conduct of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Refund Commissioner, for wilfully undermining the authority of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\nThe FTO categorically observed that there is absolutely no room for any department to undermine, bypass, or dilute the authority of the Supreme Court for any reason whatsoever.\nThe department is constitutionally and legally bound to respect, implement, and follow the judgments of the Supreme Court, and any attempt to circumvent or disregard such judgments is a direct violation of the rule of law and amounts to defiance of binding judicial orders.\nThe FTO held that failure to give appeal effect within the stipulated timeframe reflects delay, neglect, inefficiency, discrimination, and arbitrary exercise of authority, all of which squarely fall within the definition of maladministration under the law.\nThe FTO expressed deep frustration over the department\u2019s persistent reluctance to give appeal effect to finalised appellate orders, despite clear judicial observations and settled legal positions. It was noted that once issues have been conclusively settled at the highest judicial forum, there remains no justification whatsoever for filing references on identical issues.\nSuch conduct serves no lawful purpose and is merely a tactic to delay the issuance of legitimate refunds.\nUnder the applicable law, the department was obligated to give appeal effect within two months of receipt of the appellate order.\nHowever, the FTO found that despite the lapse of nearly ten months, the department has failed to comply with this mandatory legal requirement.\nThis landmark order by FTO Hijazi is being widely viewed as a strong reminder to tax authorities that administrative high-handedness cannot override constitutional mandates, and that respect for judicial supremacy is not optional but obligatory in a democratic system governed by the rule of law.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "As the Punjab Government completes two years in office this February, the moment invites a measured assessment of governance under the Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif\u2014one grounded not in slogans but in outcomes.\nIn a province as large and administratively complex as Punjab, the credibility of any government rests on its ability to translate intent into delivery.\nPublic welfare, transparent development, and institutional efficiency remain the true benchmarks of leadership, and it is against these standards that the Punjab government\u2019s record is increasingly being judged.\nOver the past two years, the Punjab Government has pursued a governance model that places technology, transparency, and service delivery at the centre of public administration.\nRather than relying on ad hoc initiatives, the focus has been on structural reforms\u2014particularly through the integration of digital systems across government departments. This shift toward e-governance aims at modernising state institutions, reduce discretionary powers, and align provincial administration with contemporary global practices.\nAs a result, Punjab\u2019s governance framework is now being referenced by other provinces and examined by policy practitioners beyond Pakistan.\nA notable feature of the Punjab government has been its emphasis on execution. While government leaders used to announce projects that stalled at the planning stage, the CM Punjab has prioritised initiatives designed for completion within defined timelines.\nThe approach reflects a move away from symbolic politics toward measurable performance. Developments in public transport, agriculture, education, and administrative reform point to a governance style focused on visible results.\nCentral to this transformation has been the recognition that effective governance in the modern era depends on robust digital infrastructure.\nUnder the direction of Chief Minister Maryam, Punjab\u2019s public institutions have undergone a systematic transition from manual, paper-based processes to integrated digital platforms.\nKey administrative functions\u2014ranging from ACRs and leave management to postings, transfers, and pension cases\u2014have been consolidated under the e-Filing and Office Automation System. These reforms have not only improved internal efficiency but also strengthened oversight and accountability.\nThe introduction of e-FOAS and e-procurement has fundamentally altered the pace and transparency of government operations.\nREAD MORE:CM for carrying out PDP projects strictly in accordance with standards\nThe traditional file culture, long associated with delays and inefficiencies, has been replaced by paperless workflows that allow real-time tracking and monitoring.\nDevelopment projects are assessed against predefined schedules, reducing cost overruns and minimising the lapse of funds. This shift has encouraged a performance-oriented culture within the bureaucracy, reinforcing discipline in both planning and execution.\nTo further enhance transparency, third-party validation of development schemes has been made mandatory. This mechanism ensures that public funds are utilised not only efficiently but also responsibly.\nIn parallel, the launch of the e-Biz Portal has simplified regulatory processes for businesses by enabling online acquisition of No Objection Certificates.\nBy eliminating repeated office visits and discretionary decision-making, the portal has reduced opportunities for corruption while improving the ease of doing business in the province.\nDigitization has also reshaped the functioning of the Civil Secretariat and government offices across Punjab.\nREAD MORE:Punjab launches uplift schemes in 11 cities\nThe conversion of paper-based workflows into digital systems has generated significant savings in administrative costs while improving record management and institutional memory. Through e-FOAS, files are digitally monitored, and delays are automatically flagged to senior management, allowing timely intervention and corrective action. This level of oversight represents a substantive step toward responsive and accountable governance.\nPublic procurement reforms have followed a similarly comprehensive path. The entire procurement cycle\u2014from advertisement to bid submission and contract award\u2014has been digitised through e-Tendering.\nThe system enforces compliance with procurement rules, safeguards data integrity, and minimises human intervention. Open access to tender information and digital bidding has promoted competition and transparency, resulting in notable savings for the public exchequer. To support this transition, 14,216 officials from 6,641 different offices across Punjab have been trained in e-procurement procedures.\nAt present, 23,302 suppliers are registered on the e-procurement platform, and 843,739 procurement activities have already been completed province-wide, underscoring the scale and institutional depth of the reform. It\u2019s satisfying that the institutional capacity-building has supported these reforms, and the e-procurement platform has emerged as a central pillar of public financial management in Punjab.\nAt the executive level, governance oversight has been strengthened through the establishment of the Chief Minister\u2019s Dashboard at the Chief Minister\u2019s Office. This digital platform enables real-time monitoring of government projects and initiatives, providing live data to support decision-making, transparency, and accountability.\nContinuous oversight through the dashboard allows effective tracking of progress, close scrutiny of project transparency, and timely corrective action, reinforcing accountability at the highest level of government.\nCitizen-centric services have also undergone significant reform through the launch of the \u2018Maryam Ki Dastak\u2019 initiative, a flagship digital service that delivers more than 76 government services directly to citizens\u2019 doorsteps via a mobile application.\nServices that once required repeated visits to government offices\u2014including certificates and official documentation\u2014can now be accessed from home with faster processing. Against a target of 2,747,828 services, 2,272,357 services have already been delivered, reflecting strong public uptake and growing trust in digital service delivery.\nTransparency and public access to information have also improved through the rapid development of official government websites. To date, 575 websites of government institutions have been completed across Punjab, strengthening public access to information and institutional visibility.\nAlongside this, the Chief Minister\u2019s Complaint Cell operates round the clock, enabling registration, monitoring, and resolution of citizen grievances. So far, 647,652 complaints have been received, of which 626,690 have been resolved, reflecting a more responsive and citizen-focused administrative culture.\nLand administration, a historically sensitive area of governance, has also seen substantive progress.\nThe Punjab Government has completed e-registration of approximately 25,000 mauzas, while 77 percent of mauzas across the province have already been digitised. The target of completing full land record digitisation by August 2026 is expected to significantly reduce disputes, manipulation, and uncertainty in revenue records, marking a decisive step toward long-term institutional reform.\nEqually consequential has been the restoration of merit in appointments and transfers. Postings across departments, including the police, are governed by defined criteria and performance indicators.\nThe chief minister\u2019s direct engagement in evaluating senior officers underscores an emphasis on accountability and professional competence. Officers demonstrating strong performance are formally recognised, reinforcing incentives for integrity and service delivery.\nCollectively, these reforms point to a governance philosophy anchored in discipline, transparency, and public service. With a stated policy of zero tolerance for corruption, the Punjab Government has sought to institutionalise accountability rather than rely on individual discretion. As the administration completes its second year, Punjab appears better positioned administratively than it was two years ago\u2014supported by digital systems, clearer rules, and a renewed focus on delivery.\nWhether these reforms achieve their full potential will depend on continuity and consolidation, but their direction has already begun to reshape the province\u2019s governance landscape.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nAzma Zahid Bokhari\nThe writer is Minister for Information and Culture, Punjab",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Amid a storm of opposition protests, the government on Friday staunchly defended its decision to join the US-led \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d under US President Donald Trump, hailing the move as a diplomatic triumph for Pakistan and its Muslim allies in the quest for peace in Gaza and the wider Muslim world.\nAddressing the joint sitting of parliament chaired by National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal described Pakistan\u2019s decision to join US-led \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d as a diplomatic win and urged lawmakers to celebrate it, despite mounting criticism from opposition benches.\nHe framed the decision as part of Pakistan\u2019s ongoing efforts to play a pivotal role in securing peace in Palestine, alongside other Muslim nations.\nIn his speech, Iqbal drew parallels with Pakistan\u2019s 1998 nuclear tests, recalling the international pressure the country faced at the time and the courage shown in defending its sovereignty.\nREAD MORE:Gaza peace board: Parliament not consulted: opposition\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need anyone to teach us about Pakistan\u2019s defence and integrity,\u201d he declared, emphasising that under the leadership of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty remains intact.\nHe also noted that the government and armed forces demonstrated strength during the 2025 India-Pakistan conflict, warning that any adversary would be met with a \u201cbefitting reply.\u201d\nTurning to the issue of Palestine, Iqbal acknowledged the suffering of Palestinians but insisted that joining the peace initiative was the right course of action.\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t joined the Board of Peace, the opposition would have criticised us for Pakistan\u2019s isolation from global peace efforts,\u201d he argued.\nHe stressed that Pakistan\u2019s stance on Israel as an aggressor remained unchanged, asserting that the government\u2019s involvement in the peace process was based on its commitment to Palestinian rights.\nIqbal also pointed to the ceasefire achieved between Israel and Hamas, which he said was partially the result of the efforts of eight Muslim nations working with the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe people of Palestine accepted that ceasefire and began to rebuild their lives,\u201d he added.\nHowever, opposition leaders vehemently opposed the government\u2019s stance as Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, the opposition leader in the Senate, stated that what Netanyahu had failed to achieve was now being pursued under the guise of a \u201cpeace board.\u201d\nHe expressed concern that Pakistan had joined the forum without national consensus and without informing lawmakers about its terms.\n\u201cThis so-called Peace Board will only add to the suffering of the Palestinians,\u201d he said, accusing Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Netanyahu of using the platform to further Israeli aggression.\nJamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also lashed out at the decision, alleging that it was driven by \u201cfear of Donald Trump\u201d and would ultimately strengthen Israel\u2019s position against Muslim countries.\nHe warned that Israel\u2019s aggressive stance would soon turn towards Pakistan after dealing with Hamas and Iran.\nRehman criticised the government for not consulting parliament and cabinet before joining the initiative. \u201cAmerica destroyed Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, and now, Israel will turn its attention to Pakistan,\u201d he warned.\nHe also drew attention to the issue of Pakistan\u2019s passport restrictions on travel to Israel, questioning why the government was engaging with a state that Pakistan officially does not recognise.\nThe debate over the Donald Trump-initiated \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d was marked by sharp divisions, with opposition leaders denouncing the government\u2019s lack of transparency and accusing it of compromising Pakistan\u2019s national dignity for geopolitical gain.\nThe opposition further argued that the peace initiative was nothing more than a facade for occupation, with Abbas urging parliament to pass a resolution rejecting the plan.\nDespite the growing controversy, the government defended its position, maintaining that its commitment to Palestinian rights and peace in the region remains steadfast.\nMeanwhile, the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, strongly condemned the arrest of human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, accusing the government of targeting political dissenters and violating the constitution.\nAchakzai denounced the arrest as a direct attack on political freedoms, stating that such actions demonstrated the ongoing suppression of dissent and the continuous erosion of basic civil rights in the country.\n\u201cTargeting political dissenters is a clear violation of the constitution,\u201d he said, adding that the government\u2019s use of the law to shield the interests of powerful elite was a troubling trend.\nHe called for the immediate release of the lawyer couple, demanding a \u201ctransparent and impartial\u201d investigation into their arrest.\nIronically, the proceedings of the joint sitting of parliament, which were previously streamed live on National Assembly\u2019s official YouTube channel, mysteriously disappeared from the platform. Additionally, the session was not telecast live on state-run television, raising questions about why this happened.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Tax Policy Office, Ministry of Finance is reviewing a proposal of Pakistan Business Council (PBC) to restore tax neutrality for dividends distributed within corporate group structures (Inter-Corporate Dividends) to avoid excessive/multiple taxation on the corporate sector.\nIn this regard, the PBC has submitted a detailed proposal to the TPO, Ministry of Finance.\nAccording to a communication of the PBC to Dr Najeeb Ahmed Memon, Director General, TPO, the PBC has highlighted restoration of tax neutrality for Inter-Corporate Dividends (ICDs).\nThe PBC has drawn particular attention to a structural distortion in Pakistan\u2019s tax framework relating to the taxation of ICDs. In this regard, the PBC has requested the restoration of tax neutrality for dividends distributed within corporate group structures, in line with sound tax policy principles and international best practices.\nREAD MORE:SECP continues to play pivotal role in advancing corporate sector\nUnder the current tax regime, profits earned by operating subsidiaries are subject to corporate income tax, super tax, and other statutory levies.\nWhen these after-tax profits are distributed to holding companies, they are taxed again as dividends, and upon onward distribution to ultimate shareholders, taxed a third time. This results in cumulative effective taxation approaching 68 percent, leaving investors with approximately Rs32 out of every Rs100 earned at the operating level.\nSuch excessive multiple taxation significantly inflates the cost of capital, suppresses investment returns, discourages reinvestment of earnings, and incentivizes capital flight toward informal or less transparent structures.\nThe PBC opined that the current ICD treatment has far-reaching consequences. Investors must generate disproportionately high pre-tax returns merely to match low-risk alternatives, discouraging long-term productive investment.\nEven minimal co-investments trigger dividend taxation, discouraging joint ventures, IPOs, and strategic partnerships. In recent instances, potential equity participation has been deferred due to ICD inefficiencies reducing foreign and domestic investment inflows, the PBC maintained.\nState-owned entities (SOEs) privatisation: Additional tax layers materially depress enterprise valuations.\nEstimates indicated that the Rs 5.5 trillion SOE equity base could suffer valuation discounts of approximately 25 percent, significantly outweighing the modest annual revenue collected from ICD taxation.\nThe ICD framework introduced in 2007-08 was developed through a structured taskforce comprising representatives from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), Institute of Chartered Accountant of Pakistan (ICAP) and industry experts. Its objective was to prevent multiple taxation of the same income within genuine group structures, in line with global best practices.\nThe earlier ICD regime included robust safeguards, including minimum effective shareholding thresholds (55 percent for listed groups, 75 percent for unlisted groups); mandatory holding periods to prevent short-term extraction; continuity of business requirements to ensure economic substance; SECP certification of group structures and arm\u2019s-length requirements and exclusions for trading and foreign subsidiaries.\nThese guardrails ensured that ICD tax neutrality applied only to bonafide operating groups and could not be misused for tax planning.\nGlobal Alignment and Competitiveness International benchmarking shows that developed and developing economies across Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, and Oceania do not tax inter-corporate dividends within bona fide group structures, and typically with far fewer safeguards than those previously embedded in Pakistan\u2019s regime.\nTax neutrality for ICD is a cornerstone of competitive tax systems that encourage scale, diversification, and global competitiveness. Pakistan\u2019s current position places organized, compliant domestic investors at a disadvantage relative to both foreign investors and informal sectors.\nThe council has requested restoration of tax neutrality for ICDs. for holding companies meeting substantial ownership thresholds (e.g. 55 percent plus effective shareholding), consistent with Pakistan\u2019s earlier framework.\nThis reform would correct a structural anomaly rather than introduce a new tax concession; unlock domestic and foreign investment; improve SOE privatization outcomes and capital market depth; support formalization, transparency and long-term revenue growth, PBC added.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

The 20-year yield touched 3.265%, while the 30-year yield surged to 3.61%, both all-time highs.\nThe benchmark 10-year yield surged to as much as 2.275%, the highest since February 1999. Yields move inversely to bond prices.\nMonday marks the start of a pivotal week in Japan, with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi set to dissolve parliament and call a snap election early next month, while the central bank meets to set policy.\nAn official from Takaichi\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party said on Sunday that the party is considering a pledge to abolish sales taxes on groceries for two years. Makoto Nishida, an opposition party official, said on Monday that Japan can permanently eliminate its sales tax on food by generating revenue from a newly created sovereign wealth fund.\nThe reported tax cut plan would \u201cimpact government spending, which would affect sentiment for the super-long-dated JGBs,\u201d said Keisuke Tsuruta, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\u201cEven shorter-dated JGBs will be affected by the news, as concerns about the nation\u2019s worsening fiscal health drive the yen weaker and raise bets for a rate hike by the BOJ.\u201d\nThe BOJ is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at the close of its meeting on Friday. But some central bank policymakers see scope to raise interest rates sooner than markets expect to contend with the weak yen, sources told Reuters.\nThe two-year yield, the one most sensitive to BOJ policy rates, increased to 1.215%, the highest in LSEG data going back to 2001.\nThe yield on the 40-year JGB, Japan\u2019s longest tenor, touched 3.95%, a record high.",

Under the approved amendments, several sections of the Elections Act, 2017 have been revised to replace the term \u201cSupreme Court\u201d with \u201cFederal Constitutional Court\u201d.\nSection 9 has been amended to include the Federal Constitutional Court. Section 66 now formally brings the court within the jurisdiction framework. Section 104 and 104A have been amended to assign election dispute matters to the Federal Constitutional Court.\nAs a result, election-related appeals, disputes, and legal interpretation under election laws will now fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court, which was established under the 27th Constitutional Amendment.\nThe bill now needs approval from the Senate and the President\u2019s assent before it becomes law. However, the opposition opposed the Elections (Amendment) Bill, 2026.\nDuring the debate, Acting Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Barrister Gohar opposed the bill, arguing that routine election matters were being shifted from the Supreme Court to the Constitutional Court unnecessarily.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

That\u2019s the way it goes in life.\u201d\nOriginally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after the war between Hamas and Israel, the board\u2019s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts, sparking concerns that Trump wants it to rival the United Nations.\nTrump however said the organisation would work \u201cin conjunction\u201d with the UN.\nThe Board of Peace\u2019s potential membership has however proved controversial, with Trump having invited Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine four years ago.\nTrump said Putin had agreed to join, while the Russian leader said he was still studying the invite.\nPermanent members must also pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a \u201cpay to play\u201d version of the UN Security Council.\nKey US allies including France and Britain have expressed skepticism, with the UK saying Thursday it would not attend the ceremony.\nThe members on stage largely held close ties to Trump, including Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Argentina\u2019s Javier Milei, or a wish to show their allegiance to the US president.\nREAD MORE:Trump tells Davos that Europe is heading in wrong direction\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over the war in Gaza, has said he will join but was not at the ceremony.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the ceremony that the board\u2019s focus was \u201cfirst and foremost on making sure that this peace deal in Gaza becomes enduring.\u201d\nTrump however said Hamas to disarm under the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire accord or it will be the \u201cend of them.\u201d\nThe launch of the board comes against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s frustration at having failed to win the Nobel Peace Prize, despite his disputed claim to have ended eight conflicts.\nThe inclusion of Putin has caused particular concern among US allies, but especially in Ukraine as it seeks an end to Moscow\u2019s nearly four-year-old invasion.\nTrump will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos after the \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d ceremony to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine \u2013 the major peace deal that continues to elude him.\nTrump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is due to travel to Moscow to meet Putin later Thursday, said in Davos that talks to end the war had made a \u201clot of progress\u201d and were down to one issue.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got it down to one issue, and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it\u2019s solvable,\u201d said Witkoff, without saying what the issue was.\nWitkoff added that he and the US leader\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner would not stay in Moscow overnight but fly straight to Abu Dhabi for \u201cmilitary to military\u201d talks.\nZelensky has meanwhile voiced fears that Trump\u2019s push to seize Greenland \u2013 which has dominated Davos so far and threatened to unravel the transatlantic alliance \u2013 could divert focus away from Russia\u2019s invasion of his country.\nTrump however said late Wednesday he had reached a \u201cframework of a future deal\u201d after meeting NATO chief Mark Rutte, and that he would therefore waive tariffs scheduled to hit European allies on February 1.\nHe gave no further details, leaving Europeans drawing only cautious sighs of relief. A source close to the talks toldAFPthat a 1951 Greenland defence pact would be renegotiated as part of the deal.",

      "fullText": "\u2018For the first time, we are not just competing locally\u2019\nSyed Sheharyar Ali is the CEO of Treet Corporation Limited and is based in Lahore. He joined the company in 2001 and has spent over two decades working across operations, manufacturing, and management, building experience on the ground rather than through quick role changes.\nHis work today spans manufacturing as well as related interests in healthcare, hospitality, technology, automobiles, trade, and education. He is known for a hands-on approach, with a focus on strengthening processes, supporting teams, and thinking in terms of long-term continuity.\nHe comes from a business family with roots in pre-Partition India, with earlier generations involved in trade, industry, and Pakistan\u2019s early economic development, including support to Muhammad Ali Jinnah and early engagement with international industry figures such as Henry Ford.\nFollowing are the edited excerpts of a recent conversation BR Research had with him:\nBR Research:TREET has different business segments\u2014razors, batteries, soap, pharma, packaging. Which of these are your main focus for the future versus the others and why?\nSyed Sheharyar Ali:All our businesses have strong potential\u2014packaging, pharma, batteries, and solar are all growing\u2014but what excites me most is blades and shaving, because that is our core and our heritage. Treet is a 73-year-old brand that my father\u2019s generation knows well, but younger consumers don\u2019t relate to it in the same way, which is a real business risk.\nGenesis is our way of rebuilding that relevance. It allows us to create a premium brand from scratch\u2014something we\u2019ve never done before\u2014while still leveraging the credibility of the Treet umbrella. For the first time, we are not just competing locally; we are stepping up to international-quality benchmarks and telling a new, modern story for a new generation.\nBRR: You have launched new brands like Genesis and Estella. Why not just launch new SKUs under the traditional \u201cTreet\u201d name?\nSSA: Because Treet as a brand has historically been positioned for the masses\u2014everyday use, value-driven, widely accessible. For Genesis, we wanted a different identity: premium, modern, aspirational. If we launched it purely as another Treet SKU, it would inherit the same perception.\nSo, we chose \u201cGenesis\u201d, with an association with Treet in our communications, to get the best of both worlds: (1) it can stand on its own as a premium brand, and (2) it still carries the strength, heritage, and credibility of the Treet umbrella. That standalone premium feel was a deliberate strategy, not a cosmetic change.\nBRR: Pakistan is a very price-sensitive market. How will a premium shaving brand win share here\u2014especially against imported and Western brands? And why launch Genesis now\u2014why not five years ago? Was this linked to multinational exits or a change in strategy?\nSSA: Even in a price-sensitive market like Pakistan, there is always a segment that is willing to pay for better quality, experience, and appearance. While that segment is smaller than in international markets, it is growing\u2014and Genesis has been positioned precisely for it. We are offering quality comparable to leading international brands like Gillette, but at roughly a 30 percent lower price, making it premium in positioning but still strong on value. The rising \u201cMade in Pakistan\u201d sentiment also works in our favour, as consumers are increasingly willing to choose high-quality local brands.\nAvailability is another key advantage. Smuggled and imported products exist, but they are often inconsistent in supply, especially when it comes to replacement cartridges. Our ability to provide reliable availability across the country gives us a strong competitive edge.\nThis launch is not driven by recent multinational exits. We have been developing Genesis for over two years, and it reflects a deeper shift inside Treet itself. Over the last five years, we have moved from being a volume-driven company to a value-driven one. That change is visible in how we invest, how we build brands, and how we compete\u2014and Genesis is the first major expression of that new strategy.\nBRR: What is the domestic market you\u2019re targeting for Genesis\u2014and will it cannibalize your existing Treet razor/blade business?\nREAD MORE:Treet Corp revises launch date for two personal care brands\nSSA: We are targeting the premium segment that used to be served by brands like Gillette and others\u2014roughly the 15\u201320 percent share of the market that sits above the mass segment. We do not see Genesis cannibalizing our existing Treet offerings because it is aimed at a different consumer segment with a different buying behaviour.\nThis is not about shifting our current customer from Treet to Genesis. It\u2019s about capturing the premium segment that we historically didn\u2019t own. In other words, Genesis should take share from premium imported or international-equivalent brands, not from our own base.\nBRR: You mentioned international markets are the \u201creal challenge.\u201d Why is that, and what will it take to compete globally?\nSSA: Internationally, the competitive bar is higher and the market is deeper. Domestically, we are confident we can offer a strong proposition: high quality at an attractive price point, improved distribution, and a local brand story. Globally, the challenge is competing on complete systems and ensuring we have everything in-house.\nBlade manufacturing is our strength. But for system razors, handles and cartridge assembly matter a lot. Historically, our weakness was in handle-making and cartridge assembly. With Genesis, we have plans to bring those capabilities in-house, because once you control the full system, you can compete much more effectively internationally.\nBRR: Given TREET\u2019s strong global reputation in blade manufacturing, what share of your revenues currently comes from exports, how do you see that evolving over the next few years, and what is your core competitive advantage in blades that allows you to defend and grow that position internationally?\nSSA: Exports currently account for about 20\u201330 percent of our revenues, with the rest coming from the local market. We were once closer to a 50\u201350 split, but exports declined as the global market shifted from basic shaving formats to system razors, where we were not fully present. That is now changing. Our goal is to take exports back to 50% or more within the next three to five years, and our five-year growth plan is built around that international expansion as we bring more of the system-razor value chain in-house in coming years.\nOur core advantage is blade manufacturing. High-quality blades are extremely difficult to make at scale\u2014only six to eight companies worldwide can do it well, and we are one of them. Even China, despite its manufacturing strength, has not been able to match our edge quality, which is why it is actually one of our largest export markets\u2014Chinese manufacturers import our blades to use in their own razors. That speaks to the depth and defensibility of our technology.\nBRR: Trends like \u201cbeard fashion\u201d changed shaving habits globally. Over the last decade, has this impacted your sales and demand profile?\nSSA: Beard fashion did grow, but it didn\u2019t eliminate razor use\u2014people still shave necklines, edges, and facial contours. The market shifted, it didn\u2019t disappear. More recently, we\u2019re also seeing heavier beard trends ease and shaving return among younger consumers, with self-grooming supporting growth in system razors. Overall, the trend changed how razors are used, not the underlying demand.\nBRR: You are entering women\u2019s hygiene with \u201cEstella.\u201d What convinced you the opportunity is real in Pakistan despite cultural taboos?\nSSA: Internationally, women\u2019s razors account for 20\u201330 percent of the market, but in Pakistan the segment has been largely under-served and rarely discussed\u2014even though the demand exists. We are launching a full women\u2019s range covering eyebrow, face, body, and hygiene shavers. What really validated the opportunity for us was that our best-selling online SKU is a women\u2019s eyebrow razor\u2014despite zero marketing.\nWith Genesis and Estella, we will run a 360-degree campaign to educate consumers and build awareness. Once education and availability come together, we believe the women\u2019s segment can become a meaningful new revenue stream, precisely because it fills a major gap in the market.\nBRR: You\u2019re launching about 35 SKUs at once. What does the launch footprint look like\u2014and why launch everything together?\nSSA: We are launching roughly 35 SKUs spanning from two-blade system razors and disposables up to five-blade premium systems. We\u2019re also introducing a niche \u201ccut-throat\u201d style single-blade shaving concept for people who treat shaving as an experience\u2014like the hot towel shave ritual.\nWhat\u2019s new for us is the scale and coordination: these SKUs will be available in 800+ outlets at the same time. This is the first time in TREET\u2019s history we\u2019re doing a synchronized launch of this breadth. It signals seriousness to the market, improves consumer visibility, and supports the premium brand-building goal.\nBRR: You\u2019re also entering grooming products (face washes, deodorants, shaving gels, etc.). Is this a revenue play or a brand-building play?\nSSA: It\u2019s mainly about brand-building and portfolio completeness. Grooming is new for us, and while these products may not be big revenue drivers initially, a full range helps position us as a complete grooming brand, not just a razor company. With a young, image-conscious population and rising focus on personal care, we see grooming as a natural and growing extension of our portfolio.\nBRR: A few years back, TREET was seen as financially stressed\u2014leveraged, expanding into new verticals, hit by interest rates and COVID. What went wrong, and what did you learn?\nSSA: The biggest lesson is simple: never over-leverage, no matter how confident you are. We were over-leveraged, and then a sequence of external shocks hit\u2014interest rates moved from roughly 9\u201310 percent to 24 percent, currency parity shifted sharply, and COVID disrupted operations. At the same time, we entered three new verticals we didn\u2019t fully understand, and we did it too quickly.\nHow did we recover? We took painful corrective steps\u2014debt restructuring, and yes, selling personal assets to meet obligations. But the core turnaround was operational: we built a stronger professional team\u2014finance, supply chain, marketing, and others \u2014and changed how the company runs. We moved from operational losses to consolidated profitability, and the difference between then and now is night and day.\nBRR: Over the next few years, how do you plan to finance growth\u2014profits, debt, equity, or something else?\nSSA: It will be a mix. Profitability now gives us room to reinvest internally. But understand that a major expansion in production or technology may need more \u2014where we bring experience and operational strength, and partners bring capital. Some expansion may still involve debt, but we\u2019re much more careful now given what we learned.\nWe\u2019re also reviewing our investment structure in subsidiaries. For instance, in the battery business we don\u2019t necessarily need to hold 90 percent ownership; we can reduce shareholding while retaining control\u2014similar to how we\u2019ve structured other parts\u2014so we can unlock capital without creating excessive leverage.\nBRR: Let\u2019s talk about batteries. With UPS demand falling but solar storage growing, how is your battery business evolving?\nSSA: Battery has been growing and performing better than many peers. Historically, a big part of the business comes from the automotive side\u2014around 60%\u2014and the rest from UPS/backup. UPS demand has shrunk, but automotive demand has increased, which has hedged the business.\nThe bigger shift now is technology: lithium-ion is the future. Prices have come down substantially over the last 2\u20133 years, and with solarization expanding, demand for storage solutions will rise. We\u2019ve partnered with a major Chinese manufacturer to launch lithium-ion batteries plus inverters\u2014about five SKUs across different sizes, including tower and wall-mounted solutions.\nWe will start with imported solutions first so we can learn what works locally\u2014what SKUs click, which don\u2019t. After that, we plan to assemble locally, and eventually, we want to develop battery management systems in Pakistan too.\nBRR: In lithium-ion, dozens of importers are already in the market. What makes you confident you can win?\nSSA: Two strengths - distribution and trust. Lithium-ion warranties are long\u2014three years up to ten years. So, the real question for consumers is: will the seller exist in five years to honour the claim? Many of the new importers might not.\nTreet as a group has 70+years of history. That credibility matters in a warranty-driven product. We believe we can build a stronger, more reliable value proposition for consumers compared to short-lived sellers who may not sustain quality and service.\nBRR: You were early in maintenance-free automotive batteries. How does the first-mover advantage help today?\nSSA: The market has two broad categories: maintained traditional batteries and maintenance-free. While competitors also sell maintenance-free now, we are number one by volume in maintenance-free due to early investment and branding.\nMaintenance-free is a growing segment and will ultimately replace maintained batteries\u2014Pakistan is one of the few countries where maintained automotive batteries still exist at scale. Our leadership there has also provided a financial cushion during industry price wars, and our earlier pivot towards automotive away from backup helped us ride out volatility better than others.\nBRR: Your pharma business holds a large domestic share in haemodialysis concentrates. What is the growth plan\u2014especially exports?\nSSA: Pharma is doing well and is largely an export play. Domestically, we already have about 60\u201370 percent market share in haemodialysis concentrates, so growth will increasingly come from exports.\nWe had a slow start because we moved facilities and had to update registrations, certifications, and compliance documentation\u2014medical products require that rigor. But our facility is among the latest and largest in the segment, and Pakistan\u2019s cost base is meaningfully lower than many other markets. Over the next six to twelve months, we expect stronger results as those regulatory and registration transitions settle.\nBRR: How serious is the problem of smuggling and counterfeiting, and how do you respond operationally?\nSSA: It\u2019s serious and it has two layers: (1) counterfeiting of our products and (2) smuggled products competing unfairly. We have built an in-house team to identify counterfeit production points. We collaborate withgovernment authorities with market intelligence, who thenraid, seal facilities, and pursue legal action. On average, this collaboration is shutting down roughly one counterfeit factory per month.\nFor smuggled products in markets, we often start with education. Many shopkeepers don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re stocking counterfeit or smuggled goods. We meet market leadership, explain the illegality and the harm (including the loss of duties/taxes), and most markets cooperate. If education doesn\u2019t work, we involve law enforcement.\nAt the same time, we believe one structural fix is needed: a dedicated government cell focused on counterfeit and smuggling across industries\u2014because when you raid one facility, you may find multiple counterfeit product lines under one roof, but agencies only act on the complaint they received.\nBRR: Costs in Pakistan keep rising. What are the main ways TREET is protecting profit margins\u2014energy, local sourcing, automation, productivity, or price?\nSSA: We are focusing on three big levers: solarization, localization, and automation.\nEnergy is one of our largest costs. Both major plants have been solarized. We have about 1.2 MW solar at the Treet plant and over 2 MW at the battery plant, reducing power cost by more than 50 percent relative to requirement.\nLocalization is also key. Some inputs\u2014like specialized steel for blades\u2014cannot be localized because the domestic industry cannot produce that grade. But we are localizing everything possible: terminals, plastic parts, and other components that previously had to be imported.\nAutomation is another lever. There was a time when manual labour was the cheaper option; that\u2019s no longer automatically true. We are pushing for higher productivity through automation and process redesign. The result is important: despite cost pressures, our profitability has improved, not declined\u2014both in local and export segments.\nBRR: Pakistan is often described as an over-regulated economy. Which regulatory or compliance burdens hurt TREET the most, and how do they affect competitiveness?\nSSA: The hardest part is not regulation itself\u2014it\u2019s the uneven enforcement and uneven compliance across competitors. We pay our taxes fully, we maintain certifications, we comply. But when competitors can evade taxes, under-invoice imports, or bypass standards, they can sell at prices that are sometimes even below our cost of production.\nThat distorts the market and slows honest companies down. In some segments, we feel it took us years just to reach break-even partly because the \u201cplaying field\u201d wasn\u2019t level. If compliance and tax enforcement were consistent across the board, it would improve competitiveness, expand the revenue base of the country, and reward companies that operate transparently.\nBRR: What is your core message to policymakers and regulators\u2014what single change would improve the industrial environment the most?\nSSA: A level playing field. Either reduce duties and simplify the structure in a way that makes compliance easier\u2014or enforce compliance consistently so everyone pays their share. We are fine paying taxes; we already do. But it must become the norm.\nSmuggling and counterfeiting are serious, but we can manage them with enforcement and market education. The bigger issue is when large competitors can operate outside the same rules\u2014because then the industry becomes structurally unfair, and honest investment is punished.",

To accelerate repeatable conversion cycles and reduce cutover risk, AUTON8 utilised MORPH to configure governed transformation logic between source and target structures, enabling the rapid refinement of mapping rules across dry runs with consistent outcomes carried into the final migration.\nFarasat Ali Naqvi, EVP Core Banking at UBL, said the successful completion of this migration within 6 months represents a significant milestone for UBL. AUTON8 MORPH proved to be a game-changer for us, with its no-code, governed and traceable transformation approach made it possible to deliver this outcome at speed. AUTON8\u2019s structured execution ensured data integrity, minimized operational risk and enabled a smooth post-migration transition, he added.\nAli Raza, Chief Operating Officer at AUTON8, said that this project reflects AUTON8\u2019s strength in delivering mission-critical banking transformations under tight timelines. Migrating customer records across 105 branches between two entirely different core banking systems, while ensuring zero critical data loss, demonstrates our automation-led execution and deep banking domain expertise. AUTON8 MORPH\u2014our no-code transformation platform\u2014enabled governed, fully traceable mapping and conversion at scale, which is how we delivered within such a compressed timeframe, he added.\nThe successful delivery of this project reinforces AUTON8\u2019s position as a trusted transformation partner for large-scale banking data migrations, enabling financial institutions to modernize core platforms while safeguarding accuracy, resilience, and customer continuity.\nIt is pertinent to mention here the merger of the United Bank Limited and Silk Bank took place last year under the supervision of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nComments are closed.",

      "fullText": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) has expressed serious concern over the government\u2019s decision to retain a Federal Excise Duty (FED) of Rs. 10 on day-old chicks, terming it a punitive and regressive measure that threatens the sustainability of the poultry sector and the food security of millions of Pakistanis.\nThe Association warned that the imposition of FED at the very start of the production cycle has sharply increased input costs, forcing many breeders and hatcheries to divert fertile eggs for sale as table eggs instead of incubation. Given the biological production cycle of poultry, reduced chick placement today will inevitably result in a severe shortage of chicken meat within the next 6 to 8 weeks. This shortage is expected to trigger unprecedented spikes in retail chicken prices, further restricting access to affordable animal protein for low-income households and exacerbating nutritional insecurity.\nPunjab, which serves as the backbone of Pakistan\u2019s poultry industry, will be particularly affected. Continued enforcement of such regressive taxation is likely to push small and medium poultry farms out of business, leading to widespread job losses, declining rural incomes, and significant economic distress across farming communities. The PPA further emphasized that under the prevailing legal framework, Federal Excise Duty cannot be levied on the production or sale of live animals, as such taxation lacks statutory backing and is inconsistent with the Constitution of Pakistan.\nPPA issued this statement during media briefing addressed by its Chairman Abdul Basit, Group Leader Dr F M Sabir, Vice Chairman Malik Muhammad Sharif, along with senior industry representatives Khalique Arshad and Dr Sajjad Arshad.\nAddressing the media, PPA Chairman Abdul Basit described the levy as a regressive tax that strikes at the very foundation of poultry production. \u201cImposing a Rs. 10 FED on a day-old chick is a catastrophic decision and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the poultry industry\u2019s dynamics. This is not merely a tax on farmers; it is effectively a tax on the food plate of every Pakistani who depends on chicken as the most affordable source of animal protein,\u201d he stated.\nGroup Leader and CEO of Sabir Poultry, Dr F M Sabir, highlighted that the industry is already under immense pressure due to high electricity tariffs and escalating feed costs, particularly stemming from restrictions on soybean imports.\nThe poultry sector contributes over 40 percent of Pakistan\u2019s total meat consumption and is central to national food security. By imposing a fixed duty at the hatchery level, the government is driving small-scale farmers out of the market, which will inevitably lead to supply shortages and sharp increases in consumer prices,\u201d he warned.\nVice Chairman PPA Malik Muhammad Sharif noted that the industry is facing a severe survival crisis. He pointed out that production costs have risen to Rs. 350\u2013380 per kilogram, while market volatility often prevents farmers from recovering these costs.\nSenior industry representatives Khalique Arshad and Dr. Sajjad Arshad urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Ministry of Finance to immediately reconsider the levy. They noted that even international stakeholders, including the IMF, have previously questioned narrowly targeted industry taxes that neither broaden the tax base nor support essential food production.\nThe Association also appealed the Prime Minister and the Federal Finance Minister to initiate meaningful dialogue with industry stakeholders and to formulate a stable, growth-oriented policy framework.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The National Tariff Commission (NTC) has imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on dumped imports of Cefadroxil into Pakistan originating in and/ or exported from China. The Commission initiated this anti-dumping investigation on May 21, 2025. The final determination is based on the information collected and/or obtained by the Commission during the investigation.\nAccording to NTC, the individual dumping margin has been determined based on information submitted by M/s Anglikang. A residual dumping margin for all the non-cooperating exporters/producers from China is determined on the basis of best available information in terms of Section 32 of the Act.\nFor the purpose of imposition of lesser duty in terms of Section 50 (2) of the Act the Commission has calculated injury margins in accordance with Rule 21 of the Rules to ascertain whether a lower duty would be adequate to remove injury being suffered by the domestic industry due to dumped imports of investigated product.\nCalculations of injury margin are as follows: (i) cost to make and sell of the domestic like product (Rs/kg) 100.00; (ii) profit: 5 percent of cost to make and sell 5.00; (iii) estimated Non-injurious price of the domestic like product (Rs/kg) 105.00; (iv) C&F price of investigated product (Rs/kg) 78.30; (v) landed cost of investigated product (Rs/ kg) 84.94; (vi) absolute injury margin (Rs/kg) 20.06; and (vii) Injury Margin as % of C&F Price 25.61.\nThe NTC argued that the injury margin worked out at 25.61 percent, which is above the dumping margin determined for the M/s Anglikang and non-cooperating exporters/producers from China. Thus, in terms of Section 50 (2) of the Act, lesser duty would be adequate to remove injury to the domestic industry. Therefore, the Commission, pursuant to powers under Section 50 of the Act, decided to impose definitive anti-dumping duties at the rates on C&F value in ad valorem terms on imports of the investigated product imported from China for a period of five years effective from September 17, 2025. However, in accordance with Section 51(ea) of the Act, definitive anti-dumping duty will not be levied on imports of the investigated product that are used as inputs in products destined solely for exports or for use in the foreign grant-in-aid projects and are covered under any scheme exempting customs duties for exports or foreign grant-in-aid projects under the Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969).\nThe investigated product is classified under PCT heading No. 2941.9090.\nDefinitive anti-dumping duty rates are as follows: (i) M/s Zhejiang Anglikang Pharmaceuticals 8.61 percent; and (ii) all other exporters/foreign producers 11.81 percent.\nThe investigated product imported from sources other than China shall not be subject to the above-mentioned definitive anti-dumping duties.\nFurthermore, as the definitive anti-dumping duty rates for all exporters/foreign producers from China are lower as compared to provisional duty rates claims for refund of difference between provisional anti-dumping duty and final anti-dumping duty with respect to the import of the investigated product would be entertained, if claimed, within the stipulated time period under Section 55(2) of the Act.\nIn accordance with Section 51 of the Act, the definitive anti-dumping duties shall take the form of ad valorem duty and be held in a non-lapsable personal ledger account established and maintained by the Commission for this purpose.\nThe release of the investigated product shall be subject to imposition of such anti-dumping duty.\nDefinitive anti-dumping duties levied would be in addition to other taxes and duties leviable on import of the investigated product under any other law.\nThe definitive anti-dumping duties would be collected in the same manner as Customs duty is collected under the Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969) and would be deposited in Commission\u2019s Non-Lapsable PLD Account.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "PESHAWAR: Businessmen from Pakistan and Afghanistan have termed the three-month closure of cross-border trade between the two neighbouring countries as disastrous for the regional economy, urging authorities to review the decision and allow resumption of commercial activities for the benefit of millions of affected people.\nSenior Vice President of Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), Zia-ul-Haq Sarhadi, And Executive Member Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), Former SVP Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Engr, Manzoor Elahi and Ahmad Shah Yarzada, Board Director PAJCCI Afghan chapter in a joint statement here on Sunday said that irreparable losses caused due to closure of trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan has affected the lives of millions of people due to its negative impact on the economy of the region.\n\u201cThe ground reality is that hundreds of millions of people in the region live below the poverty line, and closure of bilateral and transit trade has only added fuel to the fire by deepening their hardships,\u201d observed members of the business communities of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nIt is a known and established fact that both the business community of Afghanistan and Pakistan are on the same page and they wanted to expand their business with each other both in terms of bilateral and transit trade, but unfortunately the traders, exporters, farmers are the innocent victims of the policy decision.\nTrade should be kept separate from politics, as bilateral and transit trade sustains millions of poor families across the region. However, the continued suspension of trade has deprived countless households of their livelihoods, making it increasingly difficult for parents to provide food and education for their children, they added.\nThere are over 10,000 containers of Afghan Transit trade cargo stranded inside Pakistan exposed to heavy demurrage and detention charges for the past three months. Similarly there are thousands of trucks of Pakistan transit cargo from Central Asia stranded inside Afghanistan.\nThe current situation is not bearable for the business community of both Afghanistan and Pakistan, they remarked.\nSharing data of losses incurred by both Afghanistan and Pakistan due to the closure of trade, the businessmen said Afghanistan is the nearest market for Pakistani products with advance payment before delivery of goods, which means a market which pays full payment in advance.\nThe export volume of Pakistan to Afghanistan is USD 1.5 billion per annum. Since the trade stopped for the past 3 months it has inflicted a loss of USD 375 million to Pakistani exporters.\nThe export volume of Pakistan via Afghanistan to central Asia is USD 900 million per annum. The closure of the trade caused losses of USD 225 million to Pakistan exporters, they added.\nThe import of commercial goods from Central Asia to Pakistan was very cost effective, but the closure of trade caused considerable price increases in the market due to supply lines disturbed.\nPakistan lost billions of rupees in terms of import customs duty, taxes for imports cargo from Afghanistan and Central Asia, the businessmen claimed.\nReferring to use of Karachi ports for Afghan transit trade, they said Afghanistan import volume as transit via Karachi is around 40,000-45,000 containers per annum.\nThe average transit cost for each container under the heads of transport, insurance guarantee, terminal handling charges, port charges, clearing agents, forwarders, transit facility charges & etc is USD 4,000.\nThere are over 10,000 containers of transit cargo stranded in Pakistan and the above cargo is exposed to heavy demurrage and detention charges.\nEach single container is charged around USD 120 on a daily basis.\nAfghan importers are faced with loss of USD 1.2 million as penalty charges on daily basis for the demurrage, detention. The losses for the past 3 months are USD 108 million.\nAfghanistan export volume to Pakistan is USD 800 million per annum closure of the trade has inflicted loss of USD 200 million to Afghan exporters. Afghanistan export to India Via Wagah is around USD 300 million per annum.\nWhile due to closure of the trade, transit has inflicted loss of USD 75 million USD to Afghanistan exporters. Afghanistan lost billions of Afghani Rupee in terms of import customs duties & taxes due to stoppage of the transit cargo inside Pakistan.\nThe demand of traders, farmers, importers, exporters and all the related sectors across the border both from Pakistan & Afghanistan is to take a review of the current disastrous situation and reopen the trade transit for the stranded cargo on the pipeline.\nThe businessmen from both the countries said the re- export of the transit trade cargo back to the port of origin is a very complex and costly procedure and will further hurt the business community.\nThey reiterated their request addressed to both Afghanistan and Pakistan authorities to review tough stands and help allow the trade/transit in the region which is helpful for the region in terms of poverty and security.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) said welfare of labour, not mentioned in the Federal Legislative List of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, is undoubtedly a provincial subject.\nBalochistan Provincial Assembly amended Section 3 of the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour Welfare) Act, 1967 through Section 7 of the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020, revising the rates of excise duty. The Balochistan Mines Labour Welfare Department; therefore demanded from the petitioners (Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd and others) to pay excise duty on minerals at the rates revised pursuant to the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020.\nThe petitioners assailed the impugned legislation before the Balochistan High Court, which upheld it. Thus, they approached the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, which was transferred to the FCC upon the enactment of the 27th Amendment.\nREAD MORE:Judiciary, executive bodies: After 27th Amendment interpretations \u2018uniformly applied\u2019: FCC\nThe petitioners counsel argued before the FCC that Provincial Assembly, by amending Section 3 of the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour Welfare) Act, 1967 through Section 7 of the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020, acted without legislative competence. It was also contended that the imposition of excise duty is a subject within the exclusive Federal Legislative domain; therefore, the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan lacked the authority to amend the 1967 Act, particularly when such amendment effectively alters the rate or nature of excise duty.\nThe judgment, authored by Justice Aamir Farooq, noted that the imposition of excise duty falls within the federal domain, as Entry 44 of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, 1973 confers exclusive competence upon the federal legislature.\nHowever, welfare of labour, as not mentioned in the Federal Legislative List of the Fourth Schedule and not falling in any ancillary domain of the Federal Government, is undoubtedly a Provincial subject.\nThe judgment said viewed from the fiscal aspect, the imposition of excise duty squarely falls within federal legislative competence; viewed from the \u201cpublic interest\u201d aspect, the advancement of labour welfare lies well within the provincial domain. Consequently, both enactments stand on firm constitutional footing, not in conflict but in constitutional harmony, each valid in its own aspect.\nIt said that Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution 1973, consciously embraced the ethos of cooperative federalism wherein legislative fields are not rigid silos but at times interacting spheres. In this constitutional landscape, incidental overlap does not render a statute ultra vires.\nThe judgment noted that the objective of the 1967 Act is undoubtedly oriented toward the advancement of labour welfare; a domain constitutionally entrusted to the provinces. The mechanism through which this objective is pursued is the imposition of a duty of excise, not as an end in itself, but as a means carefully fashioned to finance a broader \u201cpublic interest\u201d.\nThe judgment said that the impugned statute neither encroaches upon nor displaces federal legislative authority; rather, it operates within a constitutionally permissible overlap to advance a legitimate provincial objective. Its fiscal mechanism serves as an ancillary means to realise a substantive purpose squarely rooted in labour welfare.\nThe statute does not merely levy a tax; it constructs an administrative framework for the collection, allocation, and utilisation of the proceeds, all of which are inextricably linked to the welfare of labour employed in the industry. Thus, while the recovery of excise duty is the operative mechanism of the Act, its spirit, essential character, and constitutional essence lie in the realization of labour welfare.\nTo strike down such legislation would be to adopt a rigid and formalistic approach, inconsistent with constitutional design. The Act; therefore, represents a lawful and harmonious exercise of legislative power, it concluded.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nComments are closed.",

He said the fire could not be extinguished due to a lack of modern firefighting equipment and shortage of water, and raised serious questions over the role of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA).\nHe announced that FPCCI would provide Rs50 million for the affected people and said a fundraising program would also be launched for their rehabilitation.\nFPCCI Vice President Saqib Fayaz Maggo said around 1,200 shops were reduced to ashes, holding government mismanagement responsible for the incident.\nHe said the Sindh Building Control Authority failed to perform its duties, while fire tenders did not reach the site on time and the fire brigade staff was unaware of the nature of the fire.\nHe added that traders should also adopt fire safety measures.

He demanded an increase in the number of fire stations and fire tenders and appreciated the Sindh government\u2019s announcement to reconstruct the building.\nMaggo demanded the formation of a committee comprising representatives of the government and the business community and called for strict punishment for those responsible.\nHe also urged the Sindh government to immediately restore and improve the rescue management system and demanded special tax relief for the affected traders.\nHe further said that a fire incident also occurred at Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT), where 26 containers were burnt, and demanded a federal-level inquiry into the incident.\nFPCCI Vice President Asif Sakhi said KICT is overloaded due to excessive cargo, making storage difficult. He said a one-week backlog persists at KICT, delaying container clearance, and demanded an investigation into how the fire started. He held the Sindh government and the mayor of Karachi responsible.\nUBG Patron-in-Chief S M Tanveer urged the government to take maximum measures for the affected people. He appealed to the Chief Minister of Sindh and the Mayor of Karachi to order an inquiry into how the tragedy occurred.\nHe said FPCCI is working for those who became unemployed due to the incident and urged the government to make arrangements for their employment. He emphasized that those found responsible after the inquiry must be punished accordingly.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

Uzbekistan delegation consisted of Zikrillayev Rukhullo, Deputy Director, and Agency for the Development of Light Industry, Bakhtiyarov Shakhzod, Chief Specialist, Najeeb Mushtaq Vohra, Honorary Consul of Uzbekistan, Ms Abdullayeva Dilorom Ubaydullaevna, Representative of CCI Uzbekistan and other prominent business leaders from Uzbekistan.\nOn their arrival at APTMA, they were received by Kamran Arshad, Chairman APTMA, Asad Shafi, Chairman North, Mohammad Qasim, Treasurer North, Danish Aslam, and senior executives of APTMA, leading textile manufacturers and exporters and Raza Baqir, Secretary General.\nUzbekistan delegation informed APTMA about a series of concrete steps being undertaken by the governments of Uzbekistan and Pakistan in coordination with trade associations of both the countries to upsurge bilateral trade and avail benefits from mutual potential and strengths of both the countries.\nHe added that this was a part of visits of Uzbek business persons to Pakistan and more delegations are expected in the coming months. He invited APTMA delegation to visit Uzbekistan and urged them to participate in the expo and exhibitions held in Uzbekistan from time to time.\nHead of Uzbekistan delegation said that both Pakistan and Uzbekistan share a long history and they are brothers and not competitors or rivals. They should share their resources, knowledge and wisdom for common benefits.\nHe informed that Uzbekistan Trade Centers have been opened at Karachi and Lahore and urged Pakistani textile manufacturers to benefit from the services being extended by these centers.\nThe visiting delegation said the two countries have already signed numerous agreements for ease in flow of trade and an agreement is being signed between State Bank of Pakistan and Uzbek Bank for cooperation in banking.\nHe stated that direct flights have been started from Pakistan to Tashkent which takes only two hours to reach destination and more flights are being operationalized to facilitate travel between both the countries.\nUzbek delegation proposed to sign an agreement of cooperation between APTMA and Uzbek Textile Association.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Chairman APTMA Kamran Arshad highlighted the problems in bilateral trade with Uzbekistan, saying that the issues confronting bilateral trade included logistic issues, obtaining and using Letters of Credit (LC) in trade with Uzbekistan, language barriers in labelling the goods in Uzbek or Russian languages, difficulties in land route due to security situation in Afghanistan, delay in signing of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and non-completion of trans Afghan railway line.\nKamran highlighted incentive for setting up of industries in Pakistan. He said that Pakistan was strategically located with close proximity to all foreign markets via sea, air or land routes. He added that the goods produced in Pakistan have duty free access to European Union, China and Malaysia and preferential tariff for exports to Uzbekistan, Gulf and many other countries.\nHe referred to a series of duties and tax exemptions for setting up of industries in Special Economic Zones (SEZ), Sole Enterprise Zone, Gawadar Free Trade Zone and on import of plant, machinery and raw materials for use in exportable goods.\nAsad Shafi, Chairman North said that said there is a need for strengthening of banking channels between Pakistan & Uzbekistan, as flow of trade is hampered in absence of formal banking channel. He urged for an early signing of PTA, utilization of OIC, ECO, and Shanghai Trade Cooperation platforms for expansion of bilateral trade, joint investment in the textile industry and establishment of joint ventures, frequent exchange of trade delegations, synergies in bilateral trade expansion, mutual capacity building in textile sectors, and bilateral exchange of business delegations to identify trade and investment options as a way forward to solidify trade and investment relations between Pakistan and Uzbekistan, he added.\nRaza Baqir extended vote of thanks to the visiting Uzbek delegation at the end of the meeting and hoped that frequency of such visits will facilitate expansion of bilateral trade and joint ventures in all sectors of economy especially textiles.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "MONTREAL: Canada\u2019s WestJet abruptly walked back a rollout of tighter economy seating last week after viral videos showed passengers struggling with cramped legroom. The U-turn offered a sharp warning to North American airlines redesigning cabins to favor higher-paying travelers, often by trimming space and cutting once-standard perks in the back of the plane.\nWestJet had reconfigured part of its Boeing 737 fleet to add premium seating and an extra six seats in economy. To make room, some economy rows were fitted with fixed-back seats that could not recline and the space between seats, known as the pitch, was reduced from 30 to 28 inches (76 to 71 cm). While the airline backed away, the episode has become a flashpoint in a broader North American push to chase higher-paying travelers and charge economy passengers extra for things that once came standard.\nWestJet said its changes were aimed at giving travelers more options at different prices, but critics argued it was another step toward a thinner economy product \u2014 less comfort and more fees for basics such as choosing seats.\nIndependent airline industry analyst Robert Mann said WestJet\u2019s case serves as a \u201ccautionary tale to other carriers that there is a limit\u201d to what economy passengers will tolerate.\nExecutives at Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines have told investors demand is holding up best at the front of the cabin, while demand for the cheapest tickets is more fragile as lower-income earners are pinched by rising costs since the pandemic.\nAt Delta, increased demand for premium cabins has more than offset softness in the main cabin. The airline said premium-cabin revenue surpassed main-cabin revenue for the first time in the fourth quarter, and expects nearly all near-term seat growth to come from premium cabins.\nAs airlines add extra-legroom rows, premium economy and expanded first-class cabins, the trade-offs are increasingly borne by price-sensitive travelers: less legroom, fewer inclusions, and more charges for features that used to be part of the ticket.\nUnited has expanded its use of Basic Economy, restricting changes, advance seat selection and, on many routes, limiting travelers to a personal item unless they qualify for exemptions. American has also trimmed perks on its cheapest fares.\nEven economy-focused carriers are shifting. Southwest Airlines, long known for open seating, is moving to assigned seats later this month, adding fare bundles and paid extra-legroom options.\nAir passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs said travelers have learned that economy can end up costing more than the bundled fare once fees are added.\nAirline executives say travelers benefit from lower base fares and that the trade-offs help airlines cover rising labor and operating costs. Data from research firm IdeaWorksCompany shows fares fell 3.8 percent in 2024 from a year earlier, while per-passenger revenue from add-on fees rose 2.5 percent.\nAsked for comment, WestJet referred to a Friday statement from the carrier\u2019s CEO, saying the airline \u201ctried seat pitches that are popular with many airlines around the globe as they serve to provide affordable airfares.\u201d\nEuropean budget carriers such as Ryanair, Wizz Air and easyJet have long sold seats with 28 or 29 inches separating them from the row in front. Many of those planes fly short-haul routes.",

      "fullText": "The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority\u2019s (NEPRA) State of the Industry Report is its flagship publication. It released last Friday, covered the period between July 2024 and June 2025, and earned widespread coverage.\nWithin its content, one thing was clear: efforts are being made to revitalize the sector, negotiations are being re-done, contracts re-inked, and a general feel of overhaul is being instilled. But findings of the report suggest somewhat otherwise.\nWhen you study the report, especially in the backdrop of a presentation made to the finance ministry a few days earlier, you realise one simple point: Pakistan\u2019s power sector \u2013 despite all the efforts (talk, more than actual on-ground improvement) is still a mess. It will take years of concerted effort, policymaking, provincial coordination, protests, sacrifices, and still some more to first stop the bleeding, begin the healing before a recovery can be shown. But the energy ministry, like any company CEO, is eager to show results.\nLet\u2019s begin by examining the accounts presented to Q block, the arm of the federal government responsible for allocating finances, budgeting, and then understanding the revenue side of things. Overall, FY25\u2019s revenues were down, and so were profits. For an ex-president of a major bank, the finance minister must have started paying closer attention. The presentation then states net losses are up 301%, a net financial deteriorating that indicates value destruction at the portfolio level.\nREAD MORE:Power sector: Nepra sees \u2018limited\u2019 progress despite fixes\nAmong the nine sectors that the government owns, power sector was the only with negative equity. It was second worst when it came to overall losses suffered (infrastructure and transport won the race). But the true highlight was the remark that it has an \u201cunsustainable business model\u201d.\nBut this isn\u2019t the shocking bit. What\u2019s shocking is that in the backdrop of so-called improvement in performance and the constant remarks that the sector is being overhauled and the decline has been arrested comes the revelation that power sector\u2019s losses are up 9% during FY25.\nHigh tariffs, reduction in circular debt, reforms etc and all the other claims still took the losses to Rs242 billion. Among the worst DISCO was QESCO, followed by PESCO, SEPCO, HESCO, LESCO, and then IESCO.\nWhile it may be the best-performing among its universe, IESCO still incurred a loss of Rs1.4 billion, taking its accumulated losses to Rs133.7 billion. In the remarks, it says its cost base remains high. We wonder why.\nWhen it comes to the SOI report, IESCO, which is in the top tier when it comes to controlling transmission/distribution loss and has kept its recovery nearly 435 basis points above the average recovery rate, has shown impressive results. Its financial impact, still, on the account of just these two overheads runs close to Rs10 billion combined.\nOverall, the gap between the average transmission and distribution losses of all DISCOs and the allowed benchmark by NEPRA is 612 basis points. One admits that it has come down from last-year\u2019s difference of 654 basis points, but even then, it points to one simple argument: on-ground improvements have not happened.\nThe government, with all its might and negotiations, still has work to do when it comes to privatising its DISCOs.",

      "fullText": "Awais Leghari is clearly not a fan of NEPRA\u2019s State of Industry Reports (SOIR). He slammed the 2025 edition for being published with a 5\u20136 month delay, claiming the lag made it \u201cmisleading\u201d and irrelevant to the sector\u2019s current state.\nThe truth tells a different story. Nepra reports have almost always followed this timeline. Given the scale and complexity of the SOIR, a January release is entirely plausible. Delays are structural, not exceptional.\nAt another level, the ministry\u2019s own entities bear responsibility. Persistent failures in timely submission of generation, distribution, transmission, and collection data may well have ledinto these lags.\nTo call the flagship report \u201cdated and misleading\u201d is sour in taste. Six months do not fundamentally change sector dynamics. No ground-breaking initiatives have occurred in that period that could invalidate Nepra\u2019s findings.\nIf the ministry genuinely objects to \u201cmisleading conclusions,\u201d the solution is simple: publish monthly or quarterly sectoral data publicly. Transparent, timely disclosure would allow researchers and policymakers to assess the sector accurately, rather than relying on reactive rebuttals.\nREAD MORE:Power sector: Nepra sees \u2018limited\u2019 progress despite fixes\nThe minister takes issue with Nepra\u2019s characterization of the Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per unit as \u201cadditional.\u201d Technically, he is correct. The surcharge, levied to collect a small matter of Rs1800 billion to service the loans stemming from the government\\s own colossal perennialinefficiency, over the next six years, is not new.\nBut winning the technical point misses the larger reality. This surcharge is the biggest exercise yet of penalizing the paying public for government inefficiencies. It is a tacit admission that the system cannot run without transferring the cost of loans, subsidies, and operational shortfalls directly to households.\nContrary to Leghari\u2019s framing, the DSS did not exist forever. It was introduced at the start of FY24, and the government has now formally extended it for six more years from FY25. This is not a minor clarification. It is a direct burden on the public, effectively stamping in place a mechanism to extract billions to keep a poorly managed system afloat.\nThe minister went a step further by rejecting Nepra\u2019s claim that system losses above regulatory targets impose an unnecessary burden on consumers. According to the minister, these gaps, both high losses and low recoveries, are financed by the Ministry of Finance through general revenue and therefore do not burden electricity consumers.\nThis argument takes the cake.\nLosses above allowed limits and recoveries below targets feed directly and mechanically into the circular debt pipeline. There is no abstraction here. Every rupee lost due to inefficiency adds to the debt stock that the system cannot pay for on its own.\nTo argue that additions to circular debt do not burden consumers is baffling. Consumers are already paying for it. The DSS exists precisely because the bulk of circular debt flows from distribution inefficiencies and collection failures. In FY25 alone, losses and recoveries still imposed a toll of no less than Rs400 billion, the second highest annual accumulation in history despite claimed improvements.\nThe impact does not stop there. Transmission and distribution losses are routinely factored into quarterly tariff adjustments, which the regulator hears and approves every three months. These adjustments translate directly into higher bills. The link between losses and consumer burden is neither theoretical nor indirect. It is embedded in the tariff structure itself.\nClaiming that the government absorbs the entire cost through general revenue is both incorrect and insensitive. General revenue is taxpayer money. Diverting it to cover inefficiencies in the power sector crowds out spending on health, education, and development. It does not eliminate the burden. It merely shifts and disguises it.\nTo trivialize this reality by suggesting that inefficiencies funded through the budget are somehow benign reflects a deeper problem. It normalizes failure. It treats the misuse of public resources as acceptable. And it ignores the fact that consumers pay for inefficiency twice, once through electricity bills and again through taxes.\nResponding to assessment that rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar adoption, and that weak economic activity further suppressed demand, the minister countered by claiming the average tariff had declined from Rs53.04 per unit in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit by December 2025.\nChoosing one\u2019s own goalposts because it suits the narrative is typical of governments. Yes, tariffs have come down from their peaks. But that is like saying the scoreline improved from a 10\u20130 loss two years ago to a 7\u20130 loss this time.\nThe fact remains that electricity tariffs are still very high. Marginal relief does not erase cumulative damage. Nor does it restore confidence in the grid.\nThe shift to solar will not reverse simply because tariffs have slipped a few points. Consumers made that shift when electricity became unaffordable and unpredictable. That calculation has not changed.\nIf anything, the economics now tilt further away from the grid. Solar panels continue to get cheaper. Payback periods are shortening. Every incremental reduction in equipment cost reinforces the exit decision.\nAgainst this backdrop, citing a fall in average tariffs misses the point. Behavior has already changed. The grid is competing not with past tariffs, but with falling solar costs and permanently altered consumer expectations.\nData delays do not negate dysfunction. Surcharges do not stop being burdens because they are relabeled. Losses do not disappear because they are routed through the budget. And tariffs do not become affordable because they fall from extreme to merely high.\nThe power sector\u2019s problem is not perception. It is credibility. Until inefficiency is addressed at source rather than socialized through consumers and taxpayers, the exodus from the grid will continue. And no amount of arithmetic will change that.",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released a damning report on the performance of the power sector in spite of several structural and policy level interventions that included renegotiating the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) contracts signed by previous administrations (though the 2014 contracts signed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remain effective to this day) that inordinately favoured the producers with the take-or-pay option envisaging capacity payments which, in turn, escalated as and when solar panels were encouraged as part of the government\u2019s efforts to shift towards renewables as part of reforms to withstand the climate change impacts.\nIn addition, Nepra noted that distribution companies continued to suffer from poor governance with transmission and distribution losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses. Reference was also made to Debt Service Surcharge sourced to poor governance of the power sub-sectors that accounts for higher utility tariffs with industry lamenting the fact that cross subsidies have made the cost of energy as an input into their production process much higher than the regional average, which is the reason behind the decline in exports. Circular debt, the report further noted, has risen.\nThe report undermines Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s repeated appreciation of the power sector team that perhaps prompted the Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari to publicly reject the report maintaining that it is \u201cbased on incomplete and inaccurate data which has led to widespread misunderstandings\u2026circular debt has not increased, instead for the first time a significant reduction is recorded\u2026it (circular debt) declined from 2.4 trillion rupees to 1.6 trillion rupees.\u201d The government, he said, is embarked on a six-year programme to completely eliminate circular debt which includes cancellation of 8,000MW costly projects that saved the country USD 17 billion (a saving that is not realised because the project never got off the ground) and to exclude commercial losses-based load-shedding was incorrect.\nIt has been widely reported that the government has taken 1.25 trillion rupee loans from the commercial banking sector at rates below the amount parked in the Holding Company, given the decline in the discount rate from 22 percent in 2022 to 10.5 percent today. Borrowing at lower rates to retire previous loans incurred at higher rates is welcome though ignored is the fact that borrowing that reflects poor performance and is to be payable by the hapless consumers is hardly likely to provide a comfort level to the general public.\nREAD MORE:Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report\nThe Power Minister lamented the fact that Nepra did not take into account the data provided by his Ministry \u2014 a claim that is baffling given that regulatory authorities, like Nepra and Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority), are set up to protect the consumers and not to synchronise their data with that released by the political government. Additionally, regulatory bodies safeguard public welfare and ensure quality product service while preventing fraud and anti-competitive practices.\nRegulatory authorities provide crucial benefits by safeguarding public welfare through consumer protection, ensuring product/service quality, promoting fair competition, preventing fraud/anti-competitive practices, and establishing clear frameworks for industries, leading to greater trust, market efficiency, innovation, and economic stability. It is therefore very concerning from a consumer perspective that the government has reportedly finalised amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 aimed at making Nepra subordinate to the Power Division \u2014 a report that has not been denied by the government to-date.\nTo conclude, regulatory bodies like Nepra perform a very critical function and must be allowed to continue to protect consumer interests. The incumbent government\u2019s muzzling of several entities tasked to provide a service to the general public through legislation must be abandoned in favour of a more open and participatory discharge of functions that can lay the foundation of a system capable of evolving into one where borrowing would no longer be required.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Saudi and Kuwaiti investors in K-Electric (KE) have accused the Power Division, including the minister concerned, as well as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), of conduct that has adversely affected their financial rights in the power utility.\nThese allegations form part of a USD 2 billion international arbitration initiated by Abdul Aziz Hamad A. Aljomaih, Combined National Industries Holding Company for Energy K.S.C., and others against the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\nThe notice of arbitration was sent by international law firms Steptoe and Omnia to the Attorney General for Pakistan, Mansoor Ali Khan, and Someir Siraj Khan, Head of the International Disputes Unit at the Office of the Attorney General for Pakistan.\nCopies were also forwarded to the Prime Minister, Minister for Finance and Revenue, Minister for Energy (Power Division), Minister for Law and Justice, Federal Minister for Privatisation, Secretary of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), Governor State Bank of Pakistan, and Rizwan Pesnani, Secretary, K-Electric Limited.\nAccording to the arbitration notice, the Claimants \u2014 Al-Jomaih and others \u2014 have not brought the arbitration lightly. They issued notices regarding breaches of domestic law at the time those breaches occurred and provided the state with every opportunity to remedy the failings. However, the notice states that the state repeatedly delayed action, reversed course without explanation, or failed to act altogether.\nREAD MORE:K-Electric: Govt facing arbitration threat from Saudi, Kuwaiti investors\nMost recently, the Claimants issued a Notice of Dispute under Article 17 of the OIC Investment Agreement, but despite the passage of nearly three months, the state failed or refused to participate in any form of conciliation.\nAs a result, Pakistan\u2019s largest foreign private power investment has allegedly been rendered commercially unviable, amounting to a substantial deprivation of the economic use and value of the Claimants\u2019 investments. At the same time, politically favoured actors were permitted to benefit from the state\u2019s inaction. In these circumstances, the Claimants state they had no option but to protect their investment through arbitration.\nThe notice describes KE as a fully integrated Pakistani power generation and distribution company in which the Claimants have made substantial long-term investments since its privatisation in 2005. Since then, the Claimants say they have consistently worked to promote KE\u2019s growth and commercial success, to the benefit of the company, the people of Pakistan \u2014 particularly Karachi \u2014 and KE\u2019s other shareholders.\nKE, the notice claims, was transformed from a corruption-ridden utility reliant on federal government support into a professionally managed, profitable private-sector enterprise that materially reduced system losses and reinvested earnings to strengthen and expand the business.\nThis transformation, the Claimants argue, was achieved through disciplined management and sustained capital commitment, including equity contributions and third-party debt financing. Together, these efforts enabled KE to invest more than USD 4.7 billion across the power value chain in Karachi\u2019s power infrastructure between 2005 and 2025.\nAccording to the notice, these investments delivered significant operational efficiencies and generated savings to the Respondent \u2014 the Government of Pakistan \u2014 exceeding USD 3 billion. Notably, since privatisation, the Claimants have not received any dividends, with 100 percent of profits earned since 2005 retained and reinvested in the business.\nIn addition to their investments in KE, the Saudi investors also hold investments in Pakistan through a financial interest in the proceeds from the sale of shares in Cnergyico, a transaction in which the sale proceeds were later misappropriated.\nREAD MORE:Govt devising plan to resolve KE-Nepra tariff dispute\nThe Saudi investors are not alone in this regard. The notice states that numerous other Middle Eastern investors also have an interest in those same proceeds and in KE, and that the state is required to safeguard those interests as well.\nFurther, in a letter dated November 12, 2025, the Claimants formally notified the Respondent of their intention to submit a Notice of Arbitration (NoA) in accordance with Article 17 of the OIC Investment Agreement. They stated that the Respondent\u2019s failure to acknowledge or substantively respond to their Notice of Dispute (NoD) demonstrated the parties\u2019 inability to agree on conciliation.\nOn November 13, 2025, the Respondent informed the Claimants that it was \u201cactively taking the necessary steps and coordinating with the relevant departments, ministries, and stakeholders to obtain comprehensive instructions on the claims and allegations made in the NoD.\u201d\nThe Respondent further requested the Claimants\u2019 indulgence to provide a substantive response to the NoD and to identify \u201cduly authorised representatives/negotiating team to engage in amicable, without prejudice settlement discussions,\u201d indicating that this would be done by January 14, 2026.\nThe Claimants maintain that, acting in good faith and relying on the Respondent\u2019s express assurances, they refrained from initiating arbitration and awaited the promised response. Despite these representations, the Respondent failed to provide any substantive response to the NoD, did not identify any duly authorised representatives, and took no discernible steps to engage in settlement discussions or conciliation, as proposed by the Claimants.\nAs of the date of the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent had not explain these failures. In these circumstances, the Claimants state it is evident that the Respondent is unwilling to engage meaningfully in negotiations or conciliation, rendering any further attempt at amicable resolution futile.\nThe Respondent, they argue, has therefore left the Claimants with no alternative but to commence arbitration proceedings to secure resolution of the dispute under the applicable treaty framework.\nThe Claimants own and control Al Jomaih Power Limited (AJPL) and Denham Investments Limited (Denham). Together, AJPL and Denham own 46.2 percent of KES Power Limited (Cayman Islands) (KESP). KESP, in turn, owns 66.4 percent of KE, making it the majority shareholder.\nThe arbitration notice further states that for more than eight years, the Respondent\u2019s ministries and regulators failed to act in good faith in granting or processing the required approvals. Government agencies allegedly issued inconsistent instructions, imposed new and extraneous pre-conditions, and refused to issue the final no-objection certificates required for completion.\nBy way of example, the Government of Pakistan imposed pre-conditions for obtaining National Security Committee (NSC) clearance, including the resolution of outstanding liabilities owed by KE to Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) \u2014 a state-owned gas utility \u2014 and National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) / Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G).\nWhile it was not required to do so, KESP assured the government that KE\u2019s liabilities to those entities would be settled in the normal course of business and would not be affected by the proposed sale to Shanghai Electric Power (SEP).\nAccording to the Claimants, these failures prevented completion under the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) and caused financial harm. Ultimately, SEP terminated the SPA due to the non-fulfillment of the Pakistan-specific conditions, depriving KESP of the ability to realise its investment.\nBreach of the Umbrella Clause: The arbitration notice alleges a breach of the Umbrella Clause under Article 8.1 of the OIC Investment Agreement, read together with Article 11 of the Switzerland\u2013Pakistan Bilateral Investment Treaty. Among other things, the Claimants state that the Respondent failed to comply with its obligations under the Mediation Agreement and subsequently backtracked on its express commitments that the issues raised in the 2023 Notice would be resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all parties. The Respondent\u2019s conduct, the Claimants argue, amounted to a repudiation of those commitments.\nDispute regarding Multi-Year Tariffs (MYT): KE was previously awarded a Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) for a period of seven years, from FY 2016-17 to FY 2022-23. This MYT expired on June 30, 2023.\nKE filed its petitions for generation, transmission, distribution and supply tariffs on December 1, 2022, prior to the expiry of the FY 2016-17 to FY 2022-23 MYT. However, NEPRA admitted only the generation tariff petition and returned the tariff petitions for transmission, distribution and supply, directing KE to also submit an investment plan for its transmission and distribution segments.\nIn compliance with NEPRA\u2019s directions, KE submitted the requested investment plan, covering the period FY 2023-24 to FY 2029-30, on January 30, 2023.\nSubsequently, on December 27, 2023, after NEPRA approved KE\u2019s investment plan, KE filed separate tariff petitions for the transmission of electric power, distribution of electric power, and supply of electric power for an MYT covering FY 2023-24 to FY 2029-30.\nNEPRA admitted the tariff petitions and published them along with a proposed list of issues. A public hearing was scheduled for June 27, 2024. No government entity, nor CPPA-G, participated in the public hearings concerning KE\u2019s tariff petitions.\nWhile the Respondent, through the Power Division, chose not to participate in the tariff determination hearings, it initiated parallel discussions with KE through a Power Sector Task Force, chaired by the Federal Minister for Power, Awais Leghari.\nThese discussions continued for nearly seven months, during which the Respondent provided assurances to KE that a sustainable MYT for the period FY 2023-24 to FY 2029-30 would be determined. On December 12, 2024, the Respondent, acting through the Power Division, submitted its comments on KE\u2019s tariff petitions.\nKE continued its engagement with the Respondent through the Power Sector Task Force and understood that all tariff-related issues had been resolved. NEPRA subsequently confirmed this understanding through its tariff determinations dated May 23 and May 27, 2025.\nThese determinations addressed all issues raised in the Government of Pakistan\u2019s comments and approved KE\u2019s tariff petitions in a manner consistent with the discussions held at the Power Sector Task Force level. NEPRA then forwarded the tariff determinations to the Respondent for notification, requesting that they be published in the Official Gazette.\nHowever, the Power Division failed to notify the tariff determinations within the prescribed period of 30 days. Around the same time, the Minister for Power made public statements that appeared inconsistent with the spirit and substance of the consultations held with stakeholders, including the Power Division itself, despite his role as head of the Power Sector Task Force that had negotiated the tariff outcomes.\nBetween May and June 2025, the Claimants wrote to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), formally expressing concern over the Respondent\u2019s refusal to notify the tariff determinations and highlighting the inconsistency between the Minister\u2019s public remarks and the results of the regulatory consultations.\nREAD MORE:KE\u2019s Alvi terms NEPRA\u2019s revised tariff \u2018unprecedented\u2019, warns of operational strain\nOn July 18, 2025, after the Respondent failed to notify the tariff determinations within the mandatory period, NEPRA issued the notifications itself, as permitted under Section 31(7) of the NEPRA Act.\nFollowing NEPRA\u2019s notification of the tariff determinations, the Power Division opted to challenge them through review applications, including applications filed via CPPA-G, an entity wholly owned and controlled by the Respondent. CPPA-G, acting through the Power Division, also filed writ petitions before the Islamabad High Court, seeking the suspension and setting aside of NEPRA\u2019s notifications.\nNEPRA fixed the review applications for hearing and proceeded on an expedited basis. However, NEPRA failed to provide KE with copies of all review applications along with the hearing notices, thereby depriving KE of any meaningful opportunity to prepare a comprehensive defence.\nThis haste persisted despite serious legal defects in the review applications, including the introduction of new and substantive grounds beyond the permissible scope of review, non-payment of mandatory review fees, and the lack of locus standi on the part of certain petitioners.\nThese deficiencies were expressly brought to NEPRA\u2019s attention by KE and the Claimants, through AJPL, on September 29 and October 4, 2025. KE also challenged the maintainability of the review applications during the hearings.\nThe demands advanced by the Respondent through the review applications, and subsequently conceded to by NEPRA in its review decision, are described in the notice as unlawful and arbitrary. These demands included, but were not limited to:(i) NEPRA initially allowed KE a USD-based Return on Equity for its distribution and transmission tariffs. The Power Division, however, demanded that the allowed Return on Equity be converted to a PKR-based return. For the generation tariff, the Power Division further proposed that, in addition to a PKR-based Return on Equity, a portion of the return be linked to plant despatch;(ii) NEPRA originally approved a distribution loss of 13.9 percent for FY 2024, together with a year-on-year improvement plan under the supply and distribution tariff. Based on the Ministry of Energy\u2019s demands, the allowed distribution loss trajectory was revised to begin at 9 percent in FY 2024; and(iii) NEPRA originally approved a recovery trajectory under the supply tariff, improving from 93.25 percent in FY 2024 to 96.5 percent in FY 2030. The review decision removed the recovery loss allowance entirely and imposed a 100 percent recovery target, in line with the Power Division\u2019s recommendations.\nThe Gulf investors argue that the Respondent\u2019s conduct undermines regulatory independence and violates fundamental principles of procedural fairness. They contend that the conduct breaches the OIC Investment Agreement in several respects.\nFirst, the review decisions allegedly deprive the Claimants of the economic value, viability and expected returns of their investment without compensation. Although legal title may formally remain, the cumulative impact of the review decisions is said to effectively neutralise the investment and render it economically worthless. KE has estimated that the annual financial impact of the Respondent\u2019s MYT-related demands would be approximately Rs. 85 billion for FY 2024 alone, which, the Claimants argue, would inevitably result in the economic destruction of KE.\nSecond, the Claimants assert that the arbitrary reversal of settled regulatory outcomes constitutes a repudiation of their legitimate expectations arising from the MYT framework, the discussions held with the Respondent at the Power Sector Task Force level, and NEPRA\u2019s tariff determinations. They further allege that unlawful pressure was exerted on the regulator.\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s conduct reflects a lack of transparency, consistency and good faith, undermining the stability of Pakistan\u2019s legal and business environment. They further argue that the conduct highlights NEPRA\u2019s lack of independence and its failure to act in accordance with the NEPRA Act, 1997, and the relevant provisions of the NEPRA Licensing (Distribution) Regulations, 2022.\nThird, the Claimants allege that the Respondent improperly interfered with an independent regulatory process, procured the initiation and expedited pursuit of legally deficient review proceedings, and frustrated the final and binding nature of NEPRA\u2019s tariff determinations.\nTaken cumulatively, the Claimants argue that these actions deprived them of a functioning, impartial and predictable legal framework for the determination and protection of their rights.\nFinally, the Claimants contend that the pressure exerted on NEPRA to uphold the review applications had the purpose or effect of destroying their investment and facilitating an attempt by a domestic investor to obtain control of K-Electric.",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The World Bank (WB) has reportedly raised concerns over proposed amendments to the Nepra Act, 1997, and the Electricity Act, 1910, which may compromise the independence of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), well-informed sources toldBusiness Recorder.\nUnder the proposed changes, the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d is being replaced with \u201cPower Division\u201d or \u201cdivision concerned\u201d for the approval of various regulatory proposals. On Sunday, in a rare development, sitting Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari publicly rebutted figures presented in Nepra\u2019s State of Industry Report 2024\u201325.\n\u201cThe World Bank has held one meeting with the concerned authorities and conveyed its concerns regarding the proposed replacement of the term \u2018Federal Government\u2019 with Division\u2019. Another meeting is expected in the coming days,\u201d the sources added.\nThe country\u2019s business community and industrial sector have also expressed serious concerns over the Power Division\u2019s move, warning that it could force the regulator to compromise its independence.\nAccording to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also taken notice of the Power Division\u2019s move regarding amendments to the Nepra Act.\n\u201cThe prime minister has directed the Power minister to discuss the matter with him,\u201d the sources quoted the PM Office as saying.\nSection 3(a) of the Act empowers the Authority to determine tariffs, rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services by generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and to recommend these to the relevant division for notification.\nUnder the revised Section 31(7), notification of Nepra-approved tariffs or uniform tariffs \u2014 along with rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services\u2014shall be made in the official Gazette by the division concerned within 30 days of intimation by the Authority.\nREAD MORE:Nepra approves uniform national average tariff, ignoring industry and export sector concerns\nIf the division fails to notify the tariff or refer the matter back to Nepra for reconsideration within the specified timeframe, the Authority may direct immediate application of its approved tariff through notification, subject to any subsequent adjustments arising from reconsideration requested by the Division.\nSection 31(7)(i) provides that the division concerned may, within 30 days of receiving Nepra\u2019s intimation regarding approved tariffs of public-sector distribution and supply licensees, require the Authority to reconsider its determination on issues common to these licensees. The Nepra would then be required to complete the reconsideration within 30 days and inform the division accordingly.\nUnder Section 31(7)(ii), the Nepra may make quarterly tariff adjustments within 15 days on account of capacity and transmission charges, transmission and distribution losses, variable operation and maintenance costs, and policy guidelines issued by the division concerned.\nThe adjusted tariff would be intimated to the division prior to Gazette notification. The division may seek reconsideration within 15 days, failing which Nepra shall notify the adjusted tariff in the official Gazette. If reconsideration is sought, the Nepra must decide the matter within 15 days and intimate the division before notification.\nSection 31(7)(iii) allows the division concerned, in lieu of seeking reconsideration, to file an appeal. However, once a reconsideration request is filed, the Power Division will not be entitled to subsequently appeal the decision on that reconsideration. No changes have been proposed to Section 31(7)(iv).\nSimilarly, amendments have been proposed to the Electricity Act, 1910, replacing the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cappropriate authority\u201d or \u201cdivision concerned.\u201d\nUnder the revised Section 32(2), any dispute between an operator and the telegraph authority regarding the placement or operation of electric supply lines shall be referred to the division concerned, which may direct the operator to make necessary alterations to comply with the law. Amendments to Section 53(1)(a) relate to the service of notices, orders, or documents, stipulating that where the addressee is the Federal or Provincial Government, such service shall be made at the office designated by the division concerned.\nBusiness Recordersent few questions to Power Division. Questions and their response are as follows\nThe primary purpose of the proposed amendments is to remove procedural difficulties and avoid unnecessary administrative delays. Following the Mustafa Impex judgment, the Federal Cabinet directed all ministries to review existing laws, rules, and regulations to ensure that routine and technical matters are not escalated to the Cabinet where such escalation is not required. Accordingly, the amendments mainly replace the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cconcerned Division\u201d in limited procedural contexts to streamline filings, notifications, and technical reviews, without altering the substantive regulatory framework.\nNo. This understanding is incorrect. The amendments do not make Nepra subordinate to the Power Division in any manner. The Nepra remains an independent statutory regulator, administratively reporting to the Federal Cabinet. No changes have been proposed that require amendments to the Rules of Business or that alter Nepra\u2019s legal status, independence, or quasi-judicial authority. The amendments are strictly administrative and do not interfere with Nepra\u2019s core regulatory mandate.\nNo. Wherever policy decisions or policy directions are involved, the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d has been consciously retained in the law. At no place do the proposed amendments authorise the Power Division to issue policy directions independently or bypass the Federal Cabinet. The scope of the changes is limited to procedural and technical matters only.\nThe Federal Cabinet has approved the draft set of proposed amendments. Following this, the draft legislation will undergo due legal vetting and finalisation. Once completed, the bill will be submitted to Parliament through the Parliamentary Affairs Division, in accordance with the prescribed legislative process.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority\u2019s (Nepra\u2019s) latest revision in net metering scheme stirred an expected backlash. Much of the debate focused on lower buyback rates and potential discouragement of rooftop solar adoption. Yet this framing obscures the deeper policy logic.\nThe net-metering adjustment is more about addressing three structural distortions that are embedded into Pakistan\u2019s power market than about discouraging solar power: regressive cost shifting, incompatibility with a capacity-payment dominated system, and unchecked solar expansion lacking grid flexibility.\nUnder the Alternative & Renewable Energy Distributed Generation and Net Metering Regulations, 2015, solar prosumers were allowed to offset electricity imports with exports at the retail tariff. This retail rate is not, however, a marginal energy price. It embeds a large share of fixed costs: capacity payments, network charges, legacy inefficiencies, and cross-subsidies for protected consumers.\nREAD MORE:Pakistan\u2019s net metering generation surges over 100% in Sept 2025\nAs the adoption of rooftop solar grew, mainly by upper-income urban households and commercial consumers, they increasingly escaped paying fixed system costs. As a result, the burden was imposed on the rest of the grid-dependent consumers, many of whom are not in the protected lifeline brackets, but lack the capital to invest in solar.\nThe NEPRA\u2019s State of the Industry Reports regularly record the increasing regressivity of surcharges and cross-subsidies in the tariff structure of the country. In this context, net metering functioned as a shadow subsidy, which bypassed the scrutiny of the parliament and redistributed system costs from top to bottom.\nThe revised policy implicitly reaffirms the cost causality principle, which is a statutory obligation under the Nepra Act, and not a matter of policy consideration.\nThe more fundamental tension lies in Pakistan\u2019s generation contracting structure. The power sector has evolved over the past ten years toward a regime largely dominated by long-term take-or-pay contracts. Capacity payments have become a significant and rigid part of the total system cost irrespective of the level of electricity consumption.\nNet metering enabled an increasing percentage of consumers to draw down grid offtake during daylight hours without reducing the system\u2019s fixed costs.\nCapacity costs were being recovered on an increasing per unit basis as sales volume fell. Higher tariffs in turn enhanced the economic incentive for additional consumers to install rooftop solar not as a productivity-enhancing investment, but as a defensive response to tariff escalation.\nThis mechanism generated a self-reinforcing loop: higher tariffs contributed to more grid defection, which further squeezed the sales base over which fixed costs were recovered.\nWATCH: Will Pakistan abolish net metering?\nImportantly, instead of relaxing circular debt tensions, it heightened them. In this respect Nepra\u2019s policy shift should be seen as a reaction to stop the unsustainable erosion of the tariff base, and not as a pullback from the renewable energy targets.\nThe third aspect which is often ignored is more on the technical side. Pakistan\u2019s net-metering policy was designed for rapid growth of solar with zero structure towards system integration. Rooftop solar exports peaks in the midday, when demand is weak, but no incentives have ever been offered to prosumers to get batteries or smart inverters.\nThe new net-metering regime, while harsh, throws an implicit hint at an emerging solar market orientated towards self-consumption, where solar value lies in matching generation with load, rather than sending excess out the grid at fixed prices.\nBut without a package of complementary measures, including time-of-use tariffs, incentives for storage, and mechanisms for flexibility at the distribution level, the reform may be perceived as punitive rather than corrective. Although the adjustment made by Nepra does cater to some of the distortions, the real problem is not net metering, rather it is the absence of a suitable distributed energy policy in line with the market design.\nCapacity charges continue to be volumetric rather than fixed. Although solar remains an important component of energy security for Pakistan, reforming net-metering only, in the absence of addressing these macro-structural issues, would not lead to just energy transitions.\nIncentives for green energy transition cannot be simply added on top of a fundamentally distorted structure of the market without creating further inequalities and inefficiencies.\nSo the real issue is not about the rising tariffs but whether Pakistan is prepared to restructure its power system so distributed solar flourishes with the grid rather than at the grid\u2019s expense.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nDr. Rubina Ilyas\nThe writer is a Research Economist at Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE).

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released a damning report on the performance of the power sector in spite of several structural and policy level interventions that included renegotiating the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) contracts signed by previous administrations (though the 2014 contracts signed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remain effective to this day) that inordinately favoured the producers with the take-or-pay option envisaging capacity payments which, in turn, escalated as and when solar panels were encouraged as part of the government\u2019s efforts to shift towards renewables as part of reforms to withstand the climate change impacts.\nIn addition, Nepra noted that distribution companies continued to suffer from poor governance with transmission and distribution losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses. Reference was also made to Debt Service Surcharge sourced to poor governance of the power sub-sectors that accounts for higher utility tariffs with industry lamenting the fact that cross subsidies have made the cost of energy as an input into their production process much higher than the regional average, which is the reason behind the decline in exports. Circular debt, the report further noted, has risen.\nThe report undermines Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s repeated appreciation of the power sector team that perhaps prompted the Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari to publicly reject the report maintaining that it is \u201cbased on incomplete and inaccurate data which has led to widespread misunderstandings\u2026circular debt has not increased, instead for the first time a significant reduction is recorded\u2026it (circular debt) declined from 2.4 trillion rupees to 1.6 trillion rupees.\u201d The government, he said, is embarked on a six-year programme to completely eliminate circular debt which includes cancellation of 8,000MW costly projects that saved the country USD 17 billion (a saving that is not realised because the project never got off the ground) and to exclude commercial losses-based load-shedding was incorrect.\nIt has been widely reported that the government has taken 1.25 trillion rupee loans from the commercial banking sector at rates below the amount parked in the Holding Company, given the decline in the discount rate from 22 percent in 2022 to 10.5 percent today. Borrowing at lower rates to retire previous loans incurred at higher rates is welcome though ignored is the fact that borrowing that reflects poor performance and is to be payable by the hapless consumers is hardly likely to provide a comfort level to the general public.\nREAD MORE:Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report\nThe Power Minister lamented the fact that Nepra did not take into account the data provided by his Ministry \u2014 a claim that is baffling given that regulatory authorities, like Nepra and Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority), are set up to protect the consumers and not to synchronise their data with that released by the political government. Additionally, regulatory bodies safeguard public welfare and ensure quality product service while preventing fraud and anti-competitive practices.\nRegulatory authorities provide crucial benefits by safeguarding public welfare through consumer protection, ensuring product/service quality, promoting fair competition, preventing fraud/anti-competitive practices, and establishing clear frameworks for industries, leading to greater trust, market efficiency, innovation, and economic stability. It is therefore very concerning from a consumer perspective that the government has reportedly finalised amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 aimed at making Nepra subordinate to the Power Division \u2014 a report that has not been denied by the government to-date.\nTo conclude, regulatory bodies like Nepra perform a very critical function and must be allowed to continue to protect consumer interests. The incumbent government\u2019s muzzling of several entities tasked to provide a service to the general public through legislation must be abandoned in favour of a more open and participatory discharge of functions that can lay the foundation of a system capable of evolving into one where borrowing would no longer be required.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "Weak performance by Pakistan\u2019s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country\u2019s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.\nThe report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with \u201crigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)\u201d to reduce tariffs were a milestone.\nHowever, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.\n\u201cOverall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,\u201d the report read.\nRead more:ECC approves Rs659.65bn govt guarantee for circular debt financing\nThe regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the \u201cold era of scarcity is ending\u201d, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might \u201cprove to be even more complex\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.\nIn its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.\nMeanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the \u2018Take or Pay\u2019 electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.\nNEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.\n\u201cA significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan\u2019s power system.\u201d\nThe regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.\n\u201cIt remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.\u201d\nOn the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.\nRead more:Circular debt rose Rs79bn on \u2018seasonable, operational factors\u2019: Power Division\nAt the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.\n\u201cGovernance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan\u2019s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,\u201d the NEPRA report said.\nKE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.\nIn contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.\nQESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.\nIn terms of recovery, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) was the best-placed DISCO with a recovery rate of 101.7%, followed by GEPCO and LESCO.",

      "fullText": "The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority\u2019s (NEPRA) State of the Industry Report is its flagship publication. It released last Friday, covered the period between July 2024 and June 2025, and earned widespread coverage.\nWithin its content, one thing was clear: efforts are being made to revitalize the sector, negotiations are being re-done, contracts re-inked, and a general feel of overhaul is being instilled. But findings of the report suggest somewhat otherwise.\nWhen you study the report, especially in the backdrop of a presentation made to the finance ministry a few days earlier, you realise one simple point: Pakistan\u2019s power sector \u2013 despite all the efforts (talk, more than actual on-ground improvement) is still a mess. It will take years of concerted effort, policymaking, provincial coordination, protests, sacrifices, and still some more to first stop the bleeding, begin the healing before a recovery can be shown. But the energy ministry, like any company CEO, is eager to show results.\nLet\u2019s begin by examining the accounts presented to Q block, the arm of the federal government responsible for allocating finances, budgeting, and then understanding the revenue side of things. Overall, FY25\u2019s revenues were down, and so were profits. For an ex-president of a major bank, the finance minister must have started paying closer attention. The presentation then states net losses are up 301%, a net financial deteriorating that indicates value destruction at the portfolio level.\nREAD MORE:Power sector: Nepra sees \u2018limited\u2019 progress despite fixes\nAmong the nine sectors that the government owns, power sector was the only with negative equity. It was second worst when it came to overall losses suffered (infrastructure and transport won the race). But the true highlight was the remark that it has an \u201cunsustainable business model\u201d.\nBut this isn\u2019t the shocking bit. What\u2019s shocking is that in the backdrop of so-called improvement in performance and the constant remarks that the sector is being overhauled and the decline has been arrested comes the revelation that power sector\u2019s losses are up 9% during FY25.\nHigh tariffs, reduction in circular debt, reforms etc and all the other claims still took the losses to Rs242 billion. Among the worst DISCO was QESCO, followed by PESCO, SEPCO, HESCO, LESCO, and then IESCO.\nWhile it may be the best-performing among its universe, IESCO still incurred a loss of Rs1.4 billion, taking its accumulated losses to Rs133.7 billion. In the remarks, it says its cost base remains high. We wonder why.\nWhen it comes to the SOI report, IESCO, which is in the top tier when it comes to controlling transmission/distribution loss and has kept its recovery nearly 435 basis points above the average recovery rate, has shown impressive results. Its financial impact, still, on the account of just these two overheads runs close to Rs10 billion combined.\nOverall, the gap between the average transmission and distribution losses of all DISCOs and the allowed benchmark by NEPRA is 612 basis points. One admits that it has come down from last-year\u2019s difference of 654 basis points, but even then, it points to one simple argument: on-ground improvements have not happened.\nThe government, with all its might and negotiations, still has work to do when it comes to privatising its DISCOs.",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: The latest hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior shone a sharp spotlight on the alarming state of cyber security across key state institutions, including NADRA and the FBR, whose repeated breaches have resulted in the leakage of citizens\u2019 sensitive personal data.\nSenator Afnanullah Khan was particularly forthright in pointing out systemic failures in data protection, warning that the scale and frequency of data theft from official databases could indicate possible official connivance.\nAt the same time, this pattern also signals deep structural weaknesses in the country\u2019s cyber security architecture. As the senator noted, consolidated datasets sourced from NADRA, the FBR and even the banking system are available on the dark web, underscoring the gravity of the threat and the inadequacy of existing cyber security systems.\nTroublingly, this fragility extends beyond the public sector. Private companies, including banks, telecom operators and digital platforms, among others, remain exposed to leaks, hacks and organised cybercrime, often operating with outdated security protocols and weak incident-response mechanisms.\nAttackers, meanwhile, have grown increasingly sophisticated, deploying automated tools, social engineering and cross-database correlation to monetise stolen data at scale. Clearly, cyber security is still not treated as a core governance and business risk that is backed by sustained investment, enforcement and accountability, rendering both the state and the market vulnerable in an increasingly hostile digital environment.\nREAD MORE:Citizens\u2019 personal data on dark web: NADRA asked to further strengthen cybersecurity measures\nRecent years have seen the government aggressively push a digitalisation agenda. The Digital Nation Pakistan Act passed last year, for instance, aims to build a robust digital society, economy and governance system, envisaging increased digitalisation of government departments and provision of digital identities for all citizens. What has received far less attention is that pursuing such a far-reaching agenda is not without serious risks.\nRapid digital expansion sans critical safeguards, creates large centralised data repositories, opens up more points of attack and increases the damage when systems are compromised. Any drive towards digitalisation, whether in the public or private sector, must therefore be matched by the institution of robust, continuously evolving safety protocols and protection mechanisms.\nIt is, then, shocking that Pakistan still lacks a comprehensive data protection legislation that safeguards citizens\u2019 personal and financial information, and mandates systematic investments in cyber security infrastructure, including frameworks to combat hacking, digital crimes, identity theft and financial fraud. Recent government actions in the digital realm, in fact, have exacerbated existing weaknesses in the country\u2019s cyber security infrastructure.\nMeasures such as throttling internet speeds and attempting to restrict VPN usage reveal a limited understanding of the broader implications of these actions. Slower internet, for instance, impedes critical communication channels, delaying security updates and creating vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit.\nRestricting VPNs, meanwhile, undermines essential tools for online privacy and the protection of sensitive data, weakening the security of both public and private systems across the economy. On top of that, institutions like the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency appear to prioritise citizen surveillance and clampdown on dissent over building genuine cyber resilience, a disconnect reflected in persistently low conviction rates in cybercrime cases.\nWhat is urgently needed, therefore, is firstly a recalibration of government priorities, placing cyber security above citizen surveillance in its digital agenda. Equally critical is a comprehensive data protection legislation that mandates all entities moving to digital platforms to maintain the requisite infrastructure and expertise essential to secure their systems against evolving cyber threats.\nOngoing upgrades to security protocols and digital capacities must be a statutory requirement to stay ahead of emerging risks. Importantly, an independent regulatory body, manned by data security experts rather than career bureaucrats, must oversee the enforcement of such a law. The government must realise that without a dedicated regulatory framework, the risks associated with digital expansion could actually end up undermining its benefits.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly was informed on Monday that the total circular debt, which stood at Rs2,794 billion in March 2024, was brought down to Rs1,614 billion in June 2025 \u2013 marking an improvement of Rs780 billion within just one year.\nIn response to questions raised by lawmakers, Minister for Power Awais Leghari outlined a series of measures designed to curb the accumulation of circular debt.\nHe explained that the measures included negotiations with power producers to waive Rs260 billion in late payment interest charges, along with efforts to reduce inefficiencies within Distribution Companies (Discos), which led to an improvement of Rs193 billion. As a result, the debt in Discos decreased from Rs590 billion in 2024 to Rs397 billion in 2025, he added.\nHe also highlighted improvements in macroeconomic indicators \u2013 such as a stable exchange rate, lower KIBOR, and reduced inflation \u2013 as factors that contributed to lower tariffs and reduced markup charges on payables. These, in turn, played a key role in reducing the circular debt, he added. The minister also confirmed that K-Electric had resumed regular payments as part of the debt reduction plan.\nHe stated that the government has set a target to eliminate circular debt within the next six years, supported by parallel reforms aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the power sector. \u201cThis initiative is expected to lead to the removal of the Debt Servicing Surcharge, which currently stands at Rs3.23 per unit and is levied to cover the markup on circular debt payables,\u201d he added.\nAdditionally, he mentioned that the government plans to reconstitute the boards of Discos to further address inefficiencies within distribution companies.\nMoreover, he stated that the government has begun transitioning to a more competitive electricity market, moving away from the long-standing single-buyer model, where the state was the sole purchaser of electricity.\nThe new structure will operate through competitive bidding and market-based pricing under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contractual Market (CTBCM) framework, he added.\nDuring the question hour, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik assured the House that the domestic gas sector is receiving uninterrupted supply at optimal pressure, especially during peak cooking hours.\nHe added that Sui companies are ensuring daily gas availability from 5 am to 10 pm. Malik also informed the House that the addition of 12 LNG cargoes to the supply network had improved the availability of regasified LNG (RLNG), helping meet demand across all sectors. Additionally, a dedicated dashboard has been set up to address consumer complaints on a daily basis.\nParliamentary Secretary for Communications, Gul Asghar Khan, confirmed that all infrastructure projects carried out by the National Highway Authority (NHA) adhere to international standards.\nKhan explained that the design of highways includes a 10-year lifespan for pavements and 50 years for bridges and tunnels. He also stated that the feasibility study for the M-10 Motorway is near completion and that the project will be executed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The M-9 Karachi-Hyderabad expressway will remain unchanged.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority\u2019s (Nepra\u2019s) latest revision in net metering scheme stirred an expected backlash. Much of the debate focused on lower buyback rates and potential discouragement of rooftop solar adoption. Yet this framing obscures the deeper policy logic.\nThe net-metering adjustment is more about addressing three structural distortions that are embedded into Pakistan\u2019s power market than about discouraging solar power: regressive cost shifting, incompatibility with a capacity-payment dominated system, and unchecked solar expansion lacking grid flexibility.\nUnder the Alternative & Renewable Energy Distributed Generation and Net Metering Regulations, 2015, solar prosumers were allowed to offset electricity imports with exports at the retail tariff. This retail rate is not, however, a marginal energy price. It embeds a large share of fixed costs: capacity payments, network charges, legacy inefficiencies, and cross-subsidies for protected consumers.\nREAD MORE:Pakistan\u2019s net metering generation surges over 100% in Sept 2025\nAs the adoption of rooftop solar grew, mainly by upper-income urban households and commercial consumers, they increasingly escaped paying fixed system costs. As a result, the burden was imposed on the rest of the grid-dependent consumers, many of whom are not in the protected lifeline brackets, but lack the capital to invest in solar.\nThe NEPRA\u2019s State of the Industry Reports regularly record the increasing regressivity of surcharges and cross-subsidies in the tariff structure of the country. In this context, net metering functioned as a shadow subsidy, which bypassed the scrutiny of the parliament and redistributed system costs from top to bottom.\nThe revised policy implicitly reaffirms the cost causality principle, which is a statutory obligation under the Nepra Act, and not a matter of policy consideration.\nThe more fundamental tension lies in Pakistan\u2019s generation contracting structure. The power sector has evolved over the past ten years toward a regime largely dominated by long-term take-or-pay contracts. Capacity payments have become a significant and rigid part of the total system cost irrespective of the level of electricity consumption.\nNet metering enabled an increasing percentage of consumers to draw down grid offtake during daylight hours without reducing the system\u2019s fixed costs.\nCapacity costs were being recovered on an increasing per unit basis as sales volume fell. Higher tariffs in turn enhanced the economic incentive for additional consumers to install rooftop solar not as a productivity-enhancing investment, but as a defensive response to tariff escalation.\nThis mechanism generated a self-reinforcing loop: higher tariffs contributed to more grid defection, which further squeezed the sales base over which fixed costs were recovered.\nWATCH: Will Pakistan abolish net metering?\nImportantly, instead of relaxing circular debt tensions, it heightened them. In this respect Nepra\u2019s policy shift should be seen as a reaction to stop the unsustainable erosion of the tariff base, and not as a pullback from the renewable energy targets.\nThe third aspect which is often ignored is more on the technical side. Pakistan\u2019s net-metering policy was designed for rapid growth of solar with zero structure towards system integration. Rooftop solar exports peaks in the midday, when demand is weak, but no incentives have ever been offered to prosumers to get batteries or smart inverters.\nThe new net-metering regime, while harsh, throws an implicit hint at an emerging solar market orientated towards self-consumption, where solar value lies in matching generation with load, rather than sending excess out the grid at fixed prices.\nBut without a package of complementary measures, including time-of-use tariffs, incentives for storage, and mechanisms for flexibility at the distribution level, the reform may be perceived as punitive rather than corrective. Although the adjustment made by Nepra does cater to some of the distortions, the real problem is not net metering, rather it is the absence of a suitable distributed energy policy in line with the market design.\nCapacity charges continue to be volumetric rather than fixed. Although solar remains an important component of energy security for Pakistan, reforming net-metering only, in the absence of addressing these macro-structural issues, would not lead to just energy transitions.\nIncentives for green energy transition cannot be simply added on top of a fundamentally distorted structure of the market without creating further inequalities and inefficiencies.\nSo the real issue is not about the rising tariffs but whether Pakistan is prepared to restructure its power system so distributed solar flourishes with the grid rather than at the grid\u2019s expense.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nDr. Rubina Ilyas\nThe writer is a Research Economist at Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE).

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released a damning report on the performance of the power sector in spite of several structural and policy level interventions that included renegotiating the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) contracts signed by previous administrations (though the 2014 contracts signed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remain effective to this day) that inordinately favoured the producers with the take-or-pay option envisaging capacity payments which, in turn, escalated as and when solar panels were encouraged as part of the government\u2019s efforts to shift towards renewables as part of reforms to withstand the climate change impacts.\nIn addition, Nepra noted that distribution companies continued to suffer from poor governance with transmission and distribution losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses. Reference was also made to Debt Service Surcharge sourced to poor governance of the power sub-sectors that accounts for higher utility tariffs with industry lamenting the fact that cross subsidies have made the cost of energy as an input into their production process much higher than the regional average, which is the reason behind the decline in exports. Circular debt, the report further noted, has risen.\nThe report undermines Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s repeated appreciation of the power sector team that perhaps prompted the Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari to publicly reject the report maintaining that it is \u201cbased on incomplete and inaccurate data which has led to widespread misunderstandings\u2026circular debt has not increased, instead for the first time a significant reduction is recorded\u2026it (circular debt) declined from 2.4 trillion rupees to 1.6 trillion rupees.\u201d The government, he said, is embarked on a six-year programme to completely eliminate circular debt which includes cancellation of 8,000MW costly projects that saved the country USD 17 billion (a saving that is not realised because the project never got off the ground) and to exclude commercial losses-based load-shedding was incorrect.\nIt has been widely reported that the government has taken 1.25 trillion rupee loans from the commercial banking sector at rates below the amount parked in the Holding Company, given the decline in the discount rate from 22 percent in 2022 to 10.5 percent today. Borrowing at lower rates to retire previous loans incurred at higher rates is welcome though ignored is the fact that borrowing that reflects poor performance and is to be payable by the hapless consumers is hardly likely to provide a comfort level to the general public.\nREAD MORE:Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report\nThe Power Minister lamented the fact that Nepra did not take into account the data provided by his Ministry \u2014 a claim that is baffling given that regulatory authorities, like Nepra and Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority), are set up to protect the consumers and not to synchronise their data with that released by the political government. Additionally, regulatory bodies safeguard public welfare and ensure quality product service while preventing fraud and anti-competitive practices.\nRegulatory authorities provide crucial benefits by safeguarding public welfare through consumer protection, ensuring product/service quality, promoting fair competition, preventing fraud/anti-competitive practices, and establishing clear frameworks for industries, leading to greater trust, market efficiency, innovation, and economic stability. It is therefore very concerning from a consumer perspective that the government has reportedly finalised amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 aimed at making Nepra subordinate to the Power Division \u2014 a report that has not been denied by the government to-date.\nTo conclude, regulatory bodies like Nepra perform a very critical function and must be allowed to continue to protect consumer interests. The incumbent government\u2019s muzzling of several entities tasked to provide a service to the general public through legislation must be abandoned in favour of a more open and participatory discharge of functions that can lay the foundation of a system capable of evolving into one where borrowing would no longer be required.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: Foreign direct investment (FDI) has plunged by 43 percent July-December 2025 as per data released by the State Bank of Pakistan.\nThis is a further decline from data released by the Finance Division in its monthly report titled Economic Update and Outlook for December FDI was reported at USD 927.4 million (July-November) 2025 against USD 1,242.4 million in the comparable period of the year before \u2014 a decline of 34 percent.\nPortfolio investment registered negative USD 613.8 million July-November 2025 against USD 148.7 million in the same period of 2024, thereby raising serious questions as to what are the major lacunas in FDI and portfolio investment inflows, especially, given that over USD 25 billion Memoranda of Understanding have been signed between Pakistan and other countries during the past two to three years? An oft-cited reason is the lack of environment that is conducive to foreign inflows \u2014 with Pakistan\u2019s trade deficit once again beginning to bludgeon, reflecting the inability of the reforms to break the boom-bust cycle, the foreign exchange reserves are largely if not wholly debt-based and the rupee-dollar parity remains under control due to what is perceived not as market forces.\nA news item carried in a section of press may provide another equally if not more cogent reason for not only very low FDI inflows into the country compared to our regional competitors \u2014 particularly China and India \u2014 but also the decline in the FDI in recent months.\nREAD MORE:FDI plunges 43% in 1HFY26\nThirty-two Saudi individuals and entities and five Kuwaiti investors in K-Electric have launched a USD 2 billion international arbitration case against Pakistan on 16 January 2026 after failure to resolve a dispute over regulatory intervention, unpaid government dues and a decades-long dispute over the USD 1.77 billion sale of the only private power company in the country.\nLessons must be drawn from the serious flaws in the privatisation of K-Electric under the advice of multilaterals that range from insistence to equalise tariffs countrywide through subsidies (K-Electric has been budgeted a subsidy of 125 billion rupees this year) which defeats the very purpose of privatisation, as well as the option of purchasing electricity from the national grid (which makes economic sense today though not earlier as capacity payments have risen markedly due to the ill-advised incentives given for solarisation).\nIn addition, the litigants have accused the government of undermining the independence of the regulator, Nepra, by not notifying its tariff determination in May 2025 \u2014 a charge strengthened by reports that the Power Division is seeking amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 and Electricity Act 1910 to make the regulator subordinate to its dictates though reports suggest that the Prime Minister has taken strong exception to this proposal. These concerns were voiced to the Prime Minister during his trips to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and while he did pledge to resolve these issues they remained unresolved.\nWhile administration after administration rhetorically seeks FDI yet instances where the foreign investor(s) has to resort to international arbitration abound \u2014 a major deterrent to any future investors and in a majority of cases Pakistan lost and had to pay millions of dollars of penalties.\nOne can only hope that the government in general and the Special Investment Facilitation Council in particular take cognizance of failure to respond in a timely manner to existing foreign investor concerns and begins to hold those involved responsible instead of quietly paying the penalty out of our extremely scarce foreign exchange reserves.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "The global monetary system is entering a new phase in which digital money is no longer an experiment but an emerging infrastructure of statecraft, finance, and trade. Emerging economies are fast shaping this transition rather than merely observing from sidelines.\nPakistan\u2019s recent moves toward a dollar-backed stablecoin and the tokenisation of up to US$2 billion in sovereign assets place it at a decisive inflection point in this transformation. These decisions would determine whether Pakistan becomes a pioneer in regulated digital finance or turn out to be a cautionary case of premature technological adoption without institutional depth.\nThe main question is not whether Pakistan can deploy blockchain technology, but whether it can build a coherent, credible, and resilient digital financial architecture that aligns with macroeconomic stability, financial integrity, and global regulatory expectations.\nPakistan\u2019s engagement with crypto has unfolded through caution, ambiguity, and incremental adjustment rather than a clearly articulated strategic vision. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) initially adopted a skeptical posture, highlighting risks to consumers, threats to financial stability, and the facilitation of illicit finance. In the absence of a defined legal framework, digital assets remained in a regulatory grey area\u2014neither expressly banned nor effectively regulated.\nThe policy shift toward engagement rather than outright restriction reflects a pragmatic recognition that digital assets are not disappearing and that informal crypto activity was already occurring within Pakistan.\nThe gradual acceptance toward blockchain solutions for remittances, financial inclusion, and capital markets signals an attempt to harness innovation while managing risk. The challenge remains that this shift has been reactive rather than strategically planned, leaving gaps in governance, supervision, and legal clarity.\nThe reported agreement between Pakistan and a company linked to World Liberty Financial to explore the use of its USD1 stablecoin for cross-border payments represents the most significant and controversial step in Pakistan\u2019s crypto journey.\nThe World Liberty Financial, launched in 2024 and linked to the Donald Trump family, is seeking to position itself within regulated payment systems through this partnership. The deal reportedly involves working with SBP to integrate USD1 into a regulated payments framework, though critical details remain undisclosed. The SC Financial Technologies, an associated entity, has not publicly clarified the governance, reserve backing, or legal standing of USD1. The fundamental issue is that USD1 currently lacks the regulatory foundation that most central banks would require for systemic integration.\nThe New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) has flagged that USD1 is behind on monthly reserve reporting, with the latest publicly available report dating back to July 2025. Additionally, the forthcoming U.S. GENIUS Act, expecting full implementation by early 2027, is likely to restrict stablecoin issuance to subsidiaries of regulated banks or state-qualified entities such as certain trust companies.\nBitGo Technologies, the issuer behind USD1, may not fall within these categories, raising serious legal and compliance uncertainties. Pakistan\u2019s central bank in this process must require proof of regulatory status, up-to-date reserve attestations, and clear custody arrangements before any integration. Delays in attestations and potential misalignment with future US law make USD1 a high-risk partner at this stage.\nThe economic logic behind a dollar-backed stablecoin in Pakistan is fascinating but charged with trade-offs. Stablecoin rails could significantly reduce the cost and friction of remittances, which reached approximately US$27 billion in 2023 and are expected to reach US$41 billion in fiscal year 2026, making Pakistan the largest recipient in the Initial Coin Offering (OIC). Additionally, majority of these inflows originates from the Gulf, the United Kingdom, and North America, precisely the corridors where digital payment network could deliver efficiency gains.\nThe cross-border fintech firms would likely enter Pakistan\u2019s market aggressively if a regulated USD stablecoin framework emerged, competing on fees, speed, and foreign exchange distributions. The global remittance flows to low and middle income countries reached US$690 billion in 2025, greater than both foreign direct investment and official development assistance combined, highlighting the strategic importance of this market.\nThe opportunity is clear, but so are the risks. Introduction of a widely used dollar stablecoin could deepen de-facto dollarisation within Pakistan\u2019s economy, deteriorating monetary sovereignty. The risk of parallel currency circulation could undermine the Pakistani rupee rather than modernize payments. The key policy question is whether such a stablecoin would complement or compete with Pakistan\u2019s existing financial system.\nThe parallel initiative to tokenize up to US$2 billion in sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and commodity reserves through a memorandum of understanding with Binance represents a second pillar of Pakistan\u2019s digital finance strategy.\nTokenisation of real world assets aims to enhance liquidity, transparency, and international investor access. The agreement reportedly covers government-owned assets such as energy reserves, metals, and financial instruments, subject to regulatory approvals.\nThe Federal Finance Minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, has framed this as part of Pakistan\u2019s reform arc and a long-term partnership. The Binance founder has described the move as a signal to the global blockchain industry. The policy logic is that tokenized securities could attract new categories of investors who prefer digital settlement, fractional ownership, and programmable compliance.\nREAD MORE:Pakistan explores tokenisation of real-world assets to strengthen capital markets\nThe challenge is that tokenization does not eliminate underlying economic risks such as fiscal deficits, sovereign credit risk, or political instability. The digital wrapper cannot substitute for sound macroeconomic fundamentals.\nExperience of other jurisdictions provides important lessons for Pakistan. The European Union has introduced Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation to establish clear licensing, consumer protection, and reserve requirements for stablecoins.\nThe United Arab Emirates has created a structured licensing regime for virtual asset service providers, combining innovation with prudential oversight. Japan has allowed regulated stablecoin issuance only through licensed banks, trust companies, or registered money transfer agents, ensuring institutional accountability.\nOn the contrary, Pakistan does not have a comprehensive digital assets law and instead uses limited measures like the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025. The Ordinance, in its present form, falls short of global best practices by failing to clearly define asset classification, investor protections, custodial standards, and inter-agency coordination. Lack of parliamentary legislation undermines its legitimacy and durability, making regulatory certainty fragile rather than robust.\nThe core problem lies in Pakistan\u2019s tendency to adopt instruments without building systems. The stablecoins and tokenization initiatives are being pursued as separate projects rather than as components of an integrated digital financial architecture. Payments, capital markets, and cross-border flows must be interoperable, legally aligned, and institutionally coordinated.\nThe SBP, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, and Ministry of Finance currently operate in overlapping regulatory spaces without a single unified digital finance strategy. The absence of a national framework risks regulatory arbitrage, compliance gaps, and operational fragmentation. The digital money ecosystem should function as a single regulated stack rather than a collection of disconnected pilots.\nThe execution gap remains the most significant obstacle to Pakistan\u2019s digital finance ambitions. Global experience shows that most digital money strategies fail not because of technology, but because of weak implementation, institutional turf wars, and inadequate operational infrastructure. The Pakistan\u2019s banking system remains uneven, with significant portions of the population unbanked or underbanked, particularly in rural areas.\nThe integration of stablecoins into a fragmented financial environment could exacerbate differences rather than reduce them.\nAdditionally, cross-border value transfer requires seamless interoperability between domestic banks, fintech firms, and international payment networks. Therefore, regulatory clarity is essential to avoid legal uncertainty that discourages institutional participation. The real test will be whether Pakistan can translate high-level agreements into functioning, secure, and compliant systems at scale.\nPakistan cannot ignore FATF recommendations and its controls. The country spent years exiting the grey list, and any misstep in digital asset regulation could undo that progress. Therefore, poorly designed stablecoins can obscure beneficial ownership and enable illicit flows, while the FATF travel rule requires identifying information with every transfer, a standard, many exchanges still struggle to meet. Pakistan therefore needs strong KYC, transaction monitoring, and continuous suspicious activity reporting, supported by digital identity, blockchain analytics, and efficient law enforcement.\nEmerging markets are increasingly revealing the fault lines of digital money. Fragile banking systems and a heavy reliance on cash expose the vulnerabilities of private stablecoins, while standalone Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have yet to meaningfully advance financial inclusion.\nOutcomes that are more resilient appear in hybrid arrangements that integrate regulated stablecoins, tokenized assets, and conventional banking\u2014placing Pakistan\u2019s initiative as a critical test case of state-led digital finance operating within fiscal and institutional constraints. Pakistan\u2019s weak institutional capacity remains a concern. The future of Pakistan\u2019s digital money experiment will be judged not by headlines, but by institutional strength, legal clarity, and real economic outcomes.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nHuzaima Bukhari\nThe writer is MA, LLB, Advocate High Court, Visiting Faculty at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), member Advisory Board and Visiting Senior Fellow of Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), is author of numerous books and articles on Pakistani tax laws.

He shared that Pakistan has made significant progress by reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from 75% to 70%, achieving a primary surplus and restoring fiscal balance through responsible economic management.\nHe added that inflation in Pakistan has declined sharply from a peak of 38% to single digits, while the policy rate has been reduced from over 22% to 10.5%, placing the country on the \u2018right side\u2019 of the interest rate cycle.\nAddressing the issue of climate change, the minister stated that for Pakistan and other vulnerable emerging economies, climate risks are real, recurring and economically disruptive. He noted that building fiscal buffers has enabled Pakistan to respond to recent floods through domestic resources rather than international emergency appeals, underscoring the importance of fiscal resilience in the face of exogenous shocks.\nHe further highlighted the role of public-private partnerships and capital markets in financing adaptation and development projects, citing the successful closure of Pakistan\u2019s largest-ever syndicated financing of approximately $3.6 billion for a major copper mining project.\nThe project, he noted, is expected to generate around $2.8 billion in exports annually from 2028, significantly strengthening Pakistan\u2019s export base and supporting global energy transition needs.\nResponding to a question from the audience on technology funding and the new economy, Aurangzeb emphasised Pakistan\u2019s strong potential in IT, freelancing and digital services, noting recent growth in IT exports and ongoing investments in skills development, blockchain and emerging technologies.\nHe reiterated that access to funding is not the core challenge; rather, capacity building, prioritisation and effective execution are critical to translating opportunities into sustainable growth.",

      "summary": "The government insists that the rise in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate is on an upward trajectory. All Pakistan Textile Mills Association claims that 150 units have closed down during the past year and a half. Pakistan\u2019s unemployment rate has risen to 7.09 percent to nearly 8 percent up from 6.3 percent in LFS 2020-",
      "fullText": "The government narrative on the state of the economy, not surprisingly, remains extremely upbeat though there are periodic glimpses of a deep-seated concern, given the palpable general public discontent over this claim.\nThe objective, no doubt, is to alter market perceptions that shape consumer attitudes which, in turn, may raise consumption levels that can kick-start productivity and raise employment opportunities.\nThe government insists that the rise in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate is on an upward trajectory \u2013 a claim substantiated by the 3.09 percent GDP growth for 2024-25 and 3.71 percent estimated in the first quarter (July-September) of the current fiscal year announced by the national accounts committee (NAC) on 30 December 2025 (uploaded on the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics PBS website).\nThe main driver of this growth, the government data collection agencies point out, is higher industrial productivity reflected by rising large scale manufacturing (LSM) sector growth estimated at 5.02 percent July-November 2025 in the Finance Division\u2019s December update and outlook compared to negative 0.62 percent in the same period last year with the very low base accounting for the bulk of the spurt in the growth calculation in the current year. The update for July-November was estimated at 6.01 percent by the PBS.\nHowever, the crescendo of complaints by the LSM private sector has raised legitimate concerns about the accuracy of the data that include: (i) electricity cross subsidy paid for by industry raises input costs making our exports uncompetitive \u2013 a claim supported by a decline in exports \u2013 and incentivises smuggling across hundreds of miles of our porous borders; (ii) the proactive audit of industrial units \u2013 touted as enforcement \u2013 is limited to sales tax and particularly to sugar, cement and now fertilizer sub-sectors which is an indirect tax passed onto the consumers whose incidence on the poor is greater than on the rich; (iii) delayed refunds though the Islamabad High Court recently slapped a one lakh rupee fine on Commissioner Inland Revenue in his personal capacity that may eventually be paid by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) as a Commissioner must get the Board\u2019s approval for any submissions in court; (iv) a 10.5 percent discount rate which, though more than halved from the 22 percent in May 2024, is still more than double the regional average; and (v) the freezing of accounts as penalty for non-payment of due taxes as determined by the FBR prior to the filing of appeals.\nAll Pakistan Textile Mills Association claims that 150 units have closed down during the past year and a half as a consequence of these flawed decisions while Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association revealed that over 100 spinning units have shut down leading to shortages of yarn and fabric with most of the large scale units that once operated two shifts forced to operate a single shift.\nPakistan Association of Large Steel Producers is now operating at 30 to 50 percent capacity producing 3.8 million tons per year against the installed capacity of 9 million tons. And cement dispatches fell by 3.47 percent in November 2025 year-on-year to 4.14 million tons though total dispatches rose by 11.54 percent during the first five months of the current year.\nData of the number of closures accounts for Pakistan\u2019s industrial sector\u2019s challenge to government claim of a 6.01 percent LSM growth July-November 2025.\nThe Finance Minister while addressing the Pakistan Policy Dialogue held on Wednesday this week past acknowledged the closure of multinationals but added that: (i) there is a need for a new business model rather than adhering to a 90-year-old model \u2013 he needs reminding that Pakistan has been a sovereign country for only 78.5 years, besides it is doubtful that any private sector company set up even a century ago would have followed a business model that does not aim to maximise profits; (ii) there have been 20 new foreign investors during the past 18 months \u2013 a claim not backed by government data given that foreign direct investment July-June 2024-25 was USD 2,489.7 million, an amount that compares rather unfavourably with India\u2019s USD 81 billion, with USD 1,242.4 million inflows during July-November 2024 against USD 927.4 million July-November 2025 \u2013 a decline of 25 percent; portfolio investment declined from positive USD 148.7 million July-November 2024 to negative USD 613 million July-November 2025.\nAnother set of statistics released by the PBS is challenging the government claim that the economy is generating higher employment.\nThe recently released Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2024-25 indicated the following disturbing trends when compared with the LFS 2020-21: (i) Pakistan\u2019s unemployment rate has risen to 7.09 percent to nearly 8 percent up from 6.3 percent in LFS 2020-21 across all age groups; (ii) this increase was observed both in case of males (5.5 percent in LFS 2020-21 to 5.9 in the 2024-25 LFS) and females (8.9 percent to 9.7 percent); (iii) area- wise disaggregated figures indicate that unemployment rate is up both in urban (7.3 percent in LFS 2020-21 to 8.0 percent in 2024-25) and in rural areas (5.8 percent to 6.3 percent); and (iv) unemployment rate is the highest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 9.63 percent up from 8.8 percent in LFS 2020-21 (with crude participation rate at 29.22 percent), followed by Punjab at 7.27 percent (a rise from LFS 2020-21 of 6.8 percent) with a crude participation rate of 35.66 percent and Balochistan at 5.54 percent - a rise when compared with LFS 2020-21 of 4.3 percent with a crude participation rate of 27.86 percent. Sindh performed the best, even though it too suffered from a rise in unemployment \u2013 5.28 percent in LFS 2024-25 against 3.9 percent in LFS 2020-21 and a crude participation rate of 31.66 percent.\nThe share of formal sector in employment is a mere 27.5 percent in 2024-25 LFS, a disturbing claim, against 27.6 percent in LFS 2020-21 (males accounting for 26.6 percent and females 73.4 percent females in LFS 2020-21 against 27.3 percent males and 72.5 percent females in LFS 2024-25); the informal sector accounted for 72.5 percent in LFS 2024-25 against 72.4 percent in LFS 2020-21 (males accounting for 34.5 percent in LFS 2024-25 against 26.6 percent in LFS 2020-21 and women accounting for 65.5 percent in the two LFS). The minimum wage is not enforceable in the informal sector.\nThe wages of the informal sector are at best a projection which may account for PBS to note that \u201cnotwithstanding complete observance of the requisite codes to ensure reliability of data coefficient variations and confidence intervals (were) computed in the backdrop of 5 percent margin of error,\u201d a rather high margin which critics may argue challenges claims of data integrity. This is strengthened by the wage data revealed which claims that the highest wages are in Balochistan at 27,659 rupees per month, followed by Sindh at 24,664 rupees, KPK at 24.028 and the lowest in Punjab at 23,367 rupees.\nLFS 2020-21 gives the average all Pakistan wage at 24,028 rupees per month, while the LFS 2024-25 notes a significant rise to 39042 rupees per month \u2013 a rise of 62 percent. However, this is for the formal sector \u2013 34964 to 54038 rupees per month \u2013 a rise of 54.5 percent.\nThe bulk of this raise is accounted for by the 7 percent of civilian and military personnel whose salaries are paid by the taxpayers\u2019 and who witnessed a massive increase, well above the rate of inflation, in every fiscal year.\nThe informal sector wage rose from 17,529 rupees per month in LFS 2020-21 to 30834 rupees per month \u2013 an estimate at best. However, these are estimates at best and are subject to considerable survey and surveyed bias.\nThe purchasing power of each rupee earned each year is best reflected by the rate of inflation: in 2020-21 inflation was estimated at a low of 8.9 percent however next year it rose to a high of 29.18 percent and in 2023-24 it was 23.41 percent.\nThe average inflation in 2024-25 was a low of 4.49 percent. In this context it is relevant to note that the ongoing International Monetary Fund programme noted \u201cimportant shortcomings in the source data\u201d and extended a technical assistance on government finance statistics as well as a new Producer Price Index.\nTo conclude, the private LSM sector, the rise in unemployment and the rise in the average national wage between 2020-21 and 2024-25 challenges the government industrial growth data.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is reportedly working on three proposals to reduce the industrial electricity tariff to 9 cents per kWh by eliminating cross-subsidy \u2014 one of the key demands of export-oriented industries for years,Business Recorderhas learnt from reliable sources.\nThe National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) determined the tariffs for distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs 33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs 34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26.\nFor industrial consumers, the B-2 ToU rate has been fixed at Rs 34.47/kWh, B-3 ToU at Rs 33.26/kWh, and B-4 ToU at Rs 33.04/kWh.\nThe government will notify revised tariffs after incorporating available subsidies in line with its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nLast month, the Power Division briefed the highest forum that industrial consumers are currently being charged a base variable rate of Rs 29.25 per unit against the Nepra-determined rate of Rs 23.88 per unit, effectively cross-subsidising domestic consumers by Rs 5.37 per unit.\nEliminating this cross-subsidy would require an additional budgetary allocation of Rs 160 billion per annum \u2014 Rs 131 billion for Discos and Rs 29 billion for K-Electric.\nExplaining the rationale, sources said the move would make Pakistani industry regionally competitive and encourage higher production and exports. More affordable and predictable electricity tariffs would promote higher capacity utilisation, formalisation of industrial activity, and reinvestment in existing facilities. The reform is also expected to improve power sector efficiency by reducing reliance on captive generation, strengthening grid demand, and promoting a transparent and equitable tariff structure \u2014 thereby supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation.\nBased on data from the past 50 years, the price elasticity of demand is estimated at 0.22 percent, meaning a Rs 1 per unit reduction in tariff results in additional consumption of 265 GWh. Accordingly, a Rs 5.37 per unit reduction is expected to increase industrial electricity consumption by at least 1,423 GWh. This incremental demand is projected to raise real GDP by Rs 360 billion and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 28.5 billion.\nThe overall fiscal impact of this proposal would be Rs 160 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.\nSources further noted that the power sector budget has been reduced from Rs 1,287 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs 893 billion in FY 2025-26 due to efficiency gains, and these savings should be utilised to enhance affordability and sustainability in the power sector.\nProposal 2\nAfter removal of cross-subsidy, the all-inclusive pre-tax industrial tariff would be Rs 31.34 per unit \u2014 comprising Rs 23.88 per unit variable charge, Rs 4.23 per unit fixed charge, and Rs 3.23 per unit DSS\u2014equivalent to around 11 cents per kWh (at an exchange rate of Rs 280). A further reduction of Rs 6.13 per unit would bring the final tariff down to 9 cents per kWh.\nThis would require an additional budgetary support of Rs 182 billion per annum \u2014Rs 150 billion for Discos and Rs 32 billion for K-Electric \u2014 through fiscalisation of power producers\u2019 debt, with the resulting generation cost relief ring-fenced for industrial consumers.\nIf approved, this proposal would restore industrial competitiveness, boost production and exports, and drive economic growth. Sources said reducing the final industrial tariff to 9 cents would significantly enhance the global competitiveness of Pakistan\u2019s export-oriented and energy-intensive sectors, encourage reinvestment and expansion, and reduce dependence on captive power generation. Fiscalising legacy power sector debt would separate past inefficiencies from current consumption decisions and strengthen confidence in the policy framework.\nA Rs 6.13 per unit tariff reduction is expected to increase industrial consumption by at least 1,624 GWh, raise real GDP by Rs 411 billion, and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 32.5 billion, with a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum.\nIf the first two proposals are approved, the industrial tariff would be fixed at Rs 25.21 per kWh (9 cents), requiring a total subsidy of Rs 342 billion. However, electricity consumption would increase by 3,047 GWh, real GDP would rise by Rs 771 billion, and additional tax revenue of Rs 61 billion would be generated.\nProposal 3\nThe third proposal relates to the inclusion of greenfield industries in the Grid Sustainability Package (GSP) 2025. The government has announced the GSP as a subsidy-neutral mechanism to unlock latent demand by offering electricity at the marginal cost of 8 cents per kWh for consumption above a defined baseline.\nWhile the IMF approved the GSP, it did not allow the discounted rate to apply to the entire consumption of greenfield industries. The Power Division has requested that discussions with the IMF be reopened to include greenfield industries in full, in order to ensure grid sustainability, enhance industrial competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth.\nThe Power Division believes that since the current tariff structure already ensures full recovery of fixed costs through base consumption, extending the GSP rate to the entire load of greenfield data centres, crypto-mining facilities, and copper and aluminium industries would not compromise cost recovery. IMF-approved safeguards \u2014 including a 25 percent cap on aggregate incremental consumption, semi-annual reviews, and a termination clause\u2014further mitigate fiscal and system-level risks.\nSources said these greenfield industries, particularly data centres and crypto-mining operations, have significant potential to absorb surplus power, improve system load factors, stabilise grid operations during low-demand periods, and strengthen the financial sustainability of the power sector.\nQuantitative analysis using macroeconomic indicators shows that each additional 1 GWh of electricity sales adds Rs 253 million to real GDP. Although aluminium smelting and copper refining are energy-intensive, they generate tradable output and strong local supply chains involving mining, logistics, and exports. While the economic productivity per unit of electricity is lower for data centres and crypto-mining, these sectors still contribute meaningfully to GDP growth and tax revenues.\nIf approved, this proposal would have a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) has requested Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to review and rationalise the existing recovery methodology for line fill financing cost and allow recovery at the actual financing rate incurred by OMCs to reduce financial pressure on the industry.\nIn a letter to Executive Director Finance Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority Altaf Hussain, Secretary General OCAC, Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi referenced Ogra letter of January 13, 2026, and the meeting held on January 14, 2026, chaired by the Chairman Ogra, wherein various issues concerning the oil industry and the oil industry\u2019s response regarding the recovery of line fill financing cost were deliberated.\nThe OCAC reiterated that the matter of line fill financing cost recovery-particularly the rate used for recovery had already been highlighted by the industry in its earlier correspondence of July 4, 2024.\nREAD MORE:Recovery through IFEM: OMC margins, digitisation targets critical: OCAC\nDespite this, the issue remains unresolved and continues to adversely impact the financial sustainability of Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).\nAccording to the industry, Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR) is widely recognised as a benchmark reference rate; however, it does not represent the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs.\nIn practice, banks extend financing to OMCs at a premium over KIBOR, typically around KIBOR plus 2percent, reflecting credit risk, tenor, and other standard banking considerations.\nAccordingly, recovery of line fill financing cost at KIBOR alone does not reflect the true and unavoidable cost being borne by the industry.\nBased on the financing levels currently incorporated in IFEM, the financial impact of this mismatch for the line fill during the period January-June 2025 un-recovered variance was Rs. 814,231,167 (approximately Rs. 814 million); (i) financing cost recovered at average KIBOR (11.07percent): Rs. 4,508,126,561; and (ii) actual financing cost at KIBOR (11.07percent) + 2percent: Rs. 5,322,357,727.\nThis un-recovered amount represents a material financing cost currently being absorbed by OMCs. In the prevailing interest-rate environment, such partial recovery is exerting significant pressure on cash flows, working capital, and the overall financial health of the industry.\nContinued non-recovery of actual costs is neither sustainable nor consistent with the principle of cost neutrality embedded in the regulatory framework.\nOCAC has emphasised that line fill is a regulatory and operational necessity, essential for ensuring uninterrupted and efficient supply of petroleum products through pipeline infrastructure.\nConsequently, the financing cost associated with line fill is legitimate, unavoidable, and directly attributable to regulatory operational compliance. Non-recognition of the KIBOR premium component; therefore, effectively results in partial disallowance of actual costs, which is not on merit and undermines fairness.\nIn this context, OCAC has submitted that Ogra-being the regulator and monitor of the oil industry\u2014has a critical role in ensuring that genuine and prudently incurred costs are fully recoverable.\nAligning the allowed financing rate with the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs, including the applicable premium over KIBOR, would restore cost neutrality, support industry viability, and help safeguard uninterrupted supply to the national economy.\nAfter explaining the issue, OCAC has requested Ogra to review and rationalise the existing recovery methodology for line fill financing cost and allow recovery at the actual financing rate incurred by OMCs. This measure would meaningfully reduce financial pressure on the industry.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "LAHORE: FPCCI leader and Patron-in-Chief UBG S M Tanveer has expressed serious concerns over the continued use of industrial electricity tariffs as a tool for cross subsidy, warning that this approach is steadily eroding Pakistan\u2019s industrial competitiveness and export capacity.\nHe stated that industrial tariffs are currently carrying a cross subsidy burden ranging from Rs 4.5 to Rs 7 per unit, with a total impact of Rs 131 billion, which translates into an additional cost of nearly 20 percent on already expensive electricity. According to him, industry is barely managing to carry its own burden, and this extra cost is pushing many units towards closure or long term contraction.\nS M Tanveer pointed out that over the past few years, the number of protected consumers has almost doubled, yet instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal space, the government has chosen the easier route of loading this burden onto industry. He said this policy effectively uses industry as a balancing item for systemic failures, even though industry is the only segment that consistently pays, consumes, and creates employment.\nHe strongly urged the government and the Minister for Energy Power Division to immediately remove cross subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs and to stop using industry as a substitute for fiscal reform. He stressed that protecting industry is not a concession but an economic necessity.\u2014PR",

Pakistan\u2019s new prosumer regulations mark a necessary evolution from unpriced exports toward system-aware compensation.",
      "fullText": "Pakistan\u2019s rooftop solar revolution has delivered cleaner power at record speed, but without urgent policy resets, it risks destabilising the very grid it depends on. The scale and speed of adoption have exposed structural faults in a system designed for one-way power flows from large, centralized generators. While policy responses are now emerging, failure to align incentives with system realities could still trade short-term gains for long-term grid fragmentation and inequity.\nThe numbers are eye-opening. With over 50 GW of solar panels imported into Pakistan in just five years, the country has witnessed one of the fastest market-driven clean energy transitions in the region. This surge has dramatically reshaped daytime electricity demand while leaving evening peaks largely unchanged, creating the classic \u201cduck curve\u201d that forces utilities to maintain costly standby capacity.\nAt the same time, a rapid influx of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is emerging alongside rooftop solar installations. Industrial and commercial consumers, in particular, are increasingly deploying BESS to manage load-shedding, avoid peak tariffs, and insulate operations from grid volatility.\nWhile this shift can improve reliability and flatten demand peaks, its system-wide impacts on load forecasting, tariff recovery, grid operations, safety standards, and end-of-life management have yet to be fully assessed or reflected in regulation.\nYet the financing behind this transformation remains largely opaque. The solar-and-storage boom is being driven primarily by households and firms with access to upfront capital, while lower-income consumers remain effectively locked out of the transition. As a result, the benefits of reduced bills, energy autonomy, and resilience accrue disproportionately to better-capitalized users, even as the fixed costs of maintaining the grid are increasingly borne by consumers with no access to distributed generation.\nThe release of draft revisions to the NEPRA (Prosumer) Regulations, 2025 reflects an emerging regulatory consensus that Pakistan\u2019s rooftop solar expansion is beginning to strain grid operations and cost recovery. The regulations codify a shift from net metering to net billing, replacing retail-rate compensation with credits based on the national average energy purchase price. This change recognizes that exported rooftop electricity has a system value distinct from retail consumption and must be priced accordingly.\nThat change in demand has material consequences for the financing of the power system. Transmission and distribution networks, capacity charges, and system-balancing services represent largely fixed or lumpy costs; they do not shrink in proportion to the kilowatt-hours an individual household consumes.\nWhen affluent consumers install rooftop PV and export surplus during daylight hours, they reduce their bills but continue to rely on the same wires, substations, and balancing services every evening. The residual cost must therefore be recovered from a shrinking pool of consumers, many of whom cannot afford distributed generation.\nThe new prosumer regulations partially address this imbalance by delinking export compensation from retail tariffs. However, they stop short of introducing explicit grid-access or capacity charges. As a result, fixed network costs remain socialized across non-solar consumers, leaving unresolved the equity concerns that accompany rapid rooftop adoption.\nREAD MORE:Pakistan\u2019s solar rush unlocked $17-19bn in private investment in 8 years: study\nRecognizing technical constraints, the regulations also empower distribution companies to refuse new connections where distributed generation capacity reaches 80% of a transformer\u2019s rated capacity, and to require load-flow studies for larger installations. These safeguards implicitly validate the concern that unmanaged rooftop growth can overload local networks, reinforcing the need for planning tools that anticipate not react to distributed generation impacts.\nThe revised framework reflects a broader fiscal reality. Pakistan\u2019s power sector continues to carry legacy liabilities and circular debt, and the federal government has recently relied on substantial financing packages to stabilize sector finances. In this context, policies that further erode distribution company revenues without addressing cost recovery risk deepening fiscal stress and political backlash.\nNone of this should be read as an argument against rooftop solar. Distributed PV reduces fuel imports, cuts emissions, and improves resilience. The challenge is no longer whether rooftop solar should grow, but how it should be integrated so that private benefits do not undermine collective infrastructure.\nTo that end, three pragmatic policy directions remain essential.\nFirst, remuneration must be aligned with system value through the continued rollout of net billing combined with time-of-use tariffs. Net billing alone reduces regressive cross-subsidies, but without temporal price signals it cannot address the mismatch between daytime exports and evening demand.\nSecond, transparent and modest grid-access or capacity charges should be introduced to ensure all connected users contribute fairly to fixed network costs. Such charges should be carefully designed, with exemptions or lifeline thresholds for low-income consumers, to avoid undermining energy access while preventing cost shifting from large exporters to vulnerable households.\nThird, incentives must pivot toward storage and demand-side management. Battery prices have fallen sharply, yet the current regulatory framework remains silent on encouraging hybrid solar-plus-storage systems or compensating prosumers for providing grid services. Without these incentives, the duck curve will persist, merely flattened rather than resolved.\nThe regulations provide procedural clarity through defined timelines and renewable five-year agreements, but the ability to revise export rates during the agreement term introduces uncertainty for investors. Predictable transition pathways rather than discretionary revisions will be critical to channeling investment toward grid-friendly technologies such as storage, smart inverters, and managed electric-vehicle charging.\nThese reforms are not unprecedented. Mature markets in Europe and North America have moved away from flat retail net metering toward net billing, dynamic tariffs, and grid-usage fees while preserving strong solar uptake. Citizen empowerment was not extinguished; it was redirected into models that are technically sound and economically sustainable.\nFor distribution companies, the imperative is to engage constructively with regulators and consumers to implement reforms that are evidence-based, transparent, and phased. Sudden reversals or opaque policymaking invite uncertainty and backlash; predictable transitions mobilize investment in storage, smart meters, and grid-edge services that benefit all users.\nFor consumers, the message remains straightforward: rooftop solar is a public good, but it is also part of a shared system. Individual energy independence should not erode the collective infrastructure that guarantees supply for everyone.\nOne critical issue still waiting in the wings is the end-of-life management of solar panels. With an average lifespan of 25-30 years, today\u2019s installations will become tomorrow\u2019s waste stream. The absence of any provision for environmentally sound disposal, recycling, or extended producer responsibility in the current regulatory framework risks replacing fuel imports with unmanaged solar waste undermining the sustainability narrative that solar power promises.\nPakistan\u2019s new prosumer regulations mark a necessary evolution from unpriced exports toward system-aware compensation. But regulation alone is not reform. Without complementary measures on storage, grid-access pricing, demand management, and lifecycle responsibility, the country risks solving yesterday\u2019s tariff problem while sowing tomorrow\u2019s technical, fiscal, and environmental challenges.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nAsad Mahmood\nThe writer has served at the Energy Conservation Fund, NEECA.

      "fullText": "From paper to platform: the interoperability imperative for Pakistan\u2019s health system.\nIn Pakistan, a nation with a population of approximately 250 million, the promise of digital health seems tantalizingly within reach. Multiple systems and databases are being built; hospitals are generating electronic logs, and health apps are proliferating. However, despite this surge in data collection, the core issue remains: interoperability. Without the ability to exchange, link, and meaningfully use health data across platforms and providers, these systems become little more than expensive add-ons.\nRecent research shows that while Pakistan has nascent digital health initiatives, major barriers persist: \u201climited capacity\u2026 for being able to use data to advance health\u201d, and \u201cmultiple barriers \u2026 including platforms for sharing data, interoperability and defined win-win scenarios.\u201d\nHowever, many facilities still rely predominantly on paper-based systems. A study found that the health information system \u201cpartially existed at district and sub-district offices, while was completely absent at tertiary, secondary and primary healthcare levels.\u201d\nThis means that hospitals may have databases, but if those databases cannot communicate with each other and cannot trace a patient\u2019s journey across clinics, laboratories, insurers, and hospitals, then the investment yields little insight and coordination and leaves patients vulnerable.\nMeanwhile, the cost of creating these standalone systems adds to the overall healthcare expenditure without delivering the expected returns in terms of efficiency, safety, or equity.\nDigitizing records is no longer optional; it is a dire need of the hour. However, digitization alone is not sufficient. To realize the full value of data, Pakistan must build interoperable systems: databases that are connected, standards that are shared, and workflows that cross institutional boundaries. Only then can health data become actionable, enabling continuity of care, informed policy-making, and real-time public health responses, rather than remaining locked-in islands of information.\nIn the sections that follow, we unpack the key discrepancies that arise when manual (or siloed digital) health systems dominate in Pakistan, from patient experience to national health planning, and why bridging these gaps is vital for a just, efficient, and high-performing health system.\nThe weight of paper: how manual records cripple Pakistan\u2019s healthcare system\nWalk into any government hospital or small private clinic in Pakistan, and you will find the same scene repeated: rows of steel cabinets filled with crumbling patient files, overworked clerks leafing through paper registers, and doctors scribbling hurried notes on prescription pads.\nDespite scattered attempts at digitization, the bulk of healthcare documentation in Pakistan remains paper-based, a reality that has quietly shaped every inefficiency faced by patients and providers.\nA patient with diabetes in Multan, for instance, may visit three different clinics in six months, none of which has access to her previous lab results. Each visit starts with a blank file, repeated tests, and another consultation fee. This cycle is repeated endlessly.\nPaper records have inherent limitations that compound over time. They are static, fragile, and non-shareable. A patient treated at one facility leaves with a file that has no digital counterpart, meaning that when they visit another clinic, their story starts all over again. The test results are redone, history is retaken, and medication lists are rewritten. This repetitive cycle not only wastes precious clinical time but also increases costs for both patients and the health system.\nThe consequences for clinicians are equally draining. Without an integrated record system, information retrieval is a manual, error-prone process, misplaced lab results, undocumented treatment plans, and unrecorded allergies. In high-volume facilities, missing files can delay surgeries or even misdirect treatments. A single data gap in a paper can lead to life-threatening outcomes.\nOn an institutional level, manual records mean no visibility, analytics, or learning loops. Hospitals cannot easily monitor disease patterns, manage their inventory, or track their performance. Health administrators rely on end-of-month summaries compiled manually, which are often riddled with inaccuracies. The absence of real-time data makes it nearly impossible to forecast outbreaks, allocate resources effectively and plan preventive interventions.\nThe irony runs deep: while Pakistan\u2019s financial and telecom sectors have embraced real-time digital ecosystems, its health sector is still anchored in pen-and-paper systems that belong to a bygone era. For facilities that have adopted basic digital tools, these often exist as isolated silos, unable to exchange information or follow a patient beyond their own premises.\nThis brings us to the core of the national challenge: in a fragmented landscape where health systems do not communicate with each other and paper still dominates, the absence of clear government policy and interoperability standards has left the sector without a unifying direction.\nThe policy vacuum: when innovation outpaces governance\nWhile Pakistan\u2019s healthcare providers are still grappling with paper-based systems, another challenge is the absence of a clear, unified digital health policy. Without strategic direction or regulatory enforcement, digitization efforts across the country are disjointed, reactive, and often redundant.\nThe federal and provincial health departments have long acknowledged the need for digital transformation; however, progress remains fragmented. There is no national mandate on electronic health record (EHR) standards, no established framework for interoperability, and no governing authority enforcing compliance with data exchange protocols such as HL7 or FHIR. The result is a patchwork of disconnected systems, rather than a cohesive digital ecosystem.\nThis policy void also affects how data flows \u2014 or rather, fails to flow \u2014 between stakeholders. Hospitals, laboratories, pharmacies, and insurers all operate on independent databases with no national Health Information Exchange (HIE) to connect them. Even provincial health data repositories, where they exist, function as static archives rather than dynamic, real-time systems that can generate actionable insights.\nFurthermore, there are no enforceable data security or privacy regulations tailored to healthcare, leaving sensitive patient data exposed to breaches, misuse, or commercial exploitation. The lack of a central data governance authority not only hinders accountability but also discourages institutions from sharing data, a cultural and operational barrier that perpetuates isolation.\nIn such an environment, innovation often outpaces regulations. Startups, private hospitals, and tech vendors are developing digital health platforms to fill these gaps, which is an encouraging trend. However, without interoperability guidelines or policy oversight, these solutions are growing in silos, each using its own data schema, storage conventions and exchange formats.\nToday, fewer than five percent of Pakistan\u2019s healthcare facilities use any form of structured electronic record keeping. Among those that do, most systems do not conform to HL7/FHIR standards, making cross-platform communication nearly impossible. The irony is striking: as HealthTech companies rise, many build proprietary EHRs designed entirely around in-house data models, inadvertently creating the next generation of data silos.\nIf this continues unchecked, the health sector could soon find itself facing a new kind of fragmentation \u2014 one where digital systems exist, but each speaks a private language, making national interoperability even harder to achieve.\nEmerging islands of innovation: the digital shift without a common language\nDespite the absence of a unified national policy, Pakistan\u2019s health sector has made progress. Over the past few years, a wave of HealthTech startups and digital platforms has begun to reshape healthcare access and management. From teleconsultation apps and e-pharmacy networks to hospital management systems and insurance technology solutions, this quiet digital revolution signals that the sector is ready to evolve.\nHowever, when seen in totality, these efforts represent less than five percent of the digital transformation Pakistan needs to bring its healthcare infrastructure into the 21st century. Most of these platforms operate within narrow domains \u2014 limited to outpatient consultations, pharmacy logistics, or hospital operations \u2014 rather than being part of a broader, interoperable ecosystem.\nThe core challenge lies in the lack of common technical standards. Health data across these digital systems exist in multiple formats, often determined by the internal logic of the software vendor. Without alignment on HL7 (Health Level Seven) or Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards, the global frameworks that define how health information should be structured and exchanged, these systems cannot \u201cspeak\u201d to each other.\nThis lack of standardization has serious implications. Imagine a patient who consults via one telemedicine app, gets lab results from another, and fills prescriptions through a third, each storing data in its own proprietary database. None of these systems can synchronize or cross-reference information with each other. The result is digital fragmentation, a mirror image of the manual chaos Pakistan was meant to escape.\nThe growing number of companies branding themselves as HealthTech further complicates this picture. Many offer EHR or hospital management solutions developed around closed, in-house data models. While such tools may appear functional for individual facilities, they pose long-term interoperability risk. Once hundreds of clinics and hospitals begin using EHRs designed in unique, incompatible formats, national-level data unification becomes exponentially harder; every dataset becomes a locked vault, each with its own key.\nHowever, vision alone cannot connect systems; it must be engineered through a structured national roadmap.\n(To be continued)\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nDr Hamza Sana\nThe writer is a physician turned digital health strategist, he leads large-scale health technology initiatives integrating AI, fintech, and data-driven ecosystems to improve healthcare accessibility and quality",

While federal collections are steadily closing this gap, provincial revenues would need to more than triple by FY28 to reach their expected share.\n\u201cProvincial governments have large constitutionally assigned tax handles, yet collections remain far below what the economic base suggests,\u201d said Schehzad.\nA breakdown of sector-wise data from FBR highlighted large disparities in collection efficiency. The services sector, which falls under provincial jurisdiction, has an estimated taxable base of Rs29 trillion, yet provinces collected only Rs650 billion, translating into a yield of just 2.2%.\nBy comparison, the federally administered goods sector, with a similar taxable base of around Rs30 trillion, generated Rs3.9 trillion, reflecting a 13% yield, said Schehzad.\nThe shortfall is even more pronounced in agricultural income tax, another provincial subject. Despite an estimated taxable base of Rs3.7 trillion, provinces collected only Rs8.4 billion, a yield of only 0.2%.\nProperty-related taxes \u2014 including stamp duties and urban immovable property tax \u2014 also remain significantly underutilised. Against an estimated real estate asset base of Rs21.7 trillion, provincial collections amounted to just Rs66 billion, or 0.3%.\n\u201cFederal collections are already at 11.3% of GDP and moving toward benchmark levels. Provincial collections, combined, remain at 0.85% of GDP, far below the 3% expectation, despite substantial tax bases in services, agriculture, and property sectors,\u201d said Schehzad.\nThe advisor noted that provincial revenue potential remains largely untapped. \u201cProgress demands a balanced reform agenda with stronger revenue efforts at every level.\n\u201cFederal and provincial governments are partners; closing provincial tax gaps, alongside federal reform, is key to better services, lower fiscal stress, and a fairer federation,\u201d he said.",

During audit of the accounts of MD, PPMC Islamabad for 2024-25, it was observed that Designated Entity, ie, PPMC had failed to achieve multiple Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets assigned under the NEP 2023-27 upto the FY 2024-25.\nAGP raises questions over \u2018malfeasance\u2019 in Power Division think tank\nThese included non-achievement of critical deliverables such as development of the integrated energy plan design, establishment of the Central Electrification Registry, institutionalization of strategic risk management, preparation of system value and tariff evaluation frameworks, operationalisation of MRV mechanism for GHG emissions, establishment of the R&D Secretariat, development of the Central Platform for R&D, initiation of minimum required R&D projects, and publishing of due-diligence and electrification reports within mandated timelines.\nAccording to AGP, the lapse occurred due to insufficient institutional capacity, delays in staffing and operationalisation of PPMC, lack of a robust internal monitoring mechanism for tracking NEP deliverables, and inadequate coordination with CPPA-G and other sectoral stakeholders.\nFurthermore, strategic planning functions were not fully established, resulting in weak implementation oversight and slow progress on mandated tasks. Failure to meet these NEP targets has resulted in delays in sectoral reforms, weakened progress toward national electrification, de-carbonization, risk management, and R&D institutionalization objectives, and compromised the Government\u2019s ability to implement the National Action Plan (2023-27) within stipulated timelines.\n\u201cInefficient performance resulted in non-achievement of key deliverables of the National Electricity Plan 2023-27 by designated entity PPMC upto the period 2024-25,\u201d the AGP said adding that the matter was taken up with the management in December, 2025. No reply was received to date.\nAudit has recommended that PPMC should immediately develop and implement a robust action plan to achieve all pending NEP 2023-27 deliverables within stipulated timelines. The Ministry of Energy (Power Division) should strengthen monitoring, reporting,\nThe AGP further stated that during audit of the accounts of MD, PPMC Islamabad for 2024-25, it was observed that despite the Cabinet\u2019s approval to transfer the function of developing uniform designs, standards, and specifications (11kV and below) for distribution sector from NGC/NTDC to PPMC, and subsequent instructions by Power Division on 19.05.2025, the designated function was neither timely established nor fully operationalised.\nThe BoD in its meeting held on April 10,2025 approved the inclusion of the strategy energy Financing and Design and Standards functions within the organizational structure of PPMC and HR and Legal Committee in its 139th meeting of May 26, 2025 approved the 15 posts excluding support staff. However, delays persisted in deployment of technical HR, transfer of documentation, systems handover, and establishment of operational readiness. As a result, functional control over distribution design and specifications remained fragmented between NGC/NTDC and PPMC.\nThe AGP maintained that this delay, caused by inadequate follow-up after Cabinet approval, absence of a structured implementation roadmap, and slow migration of resources, has led to non-uniform technical standards across DISCOs, risks of procurement and design inconsistencies, potential quality deviations, and hindered achievement of the National Electricity Policy 2021 goal of a standardized, efficient, and optimized distribution system.\nNon-adherence to cabinet directive and NEP-2021 resulted in delayed transfer and non-operationalisation of design, standards and specification (DSS) function from NGC to PPM? upto the period 2024-25. The matter was taken up with the management in December, 2025. No reply was received to date.\nAudit recommended that PPMC should expedite full operationalisation of the design & standards function by completing staff deployment, system transfer, and implementation milestones in line with cabinet directives and NEP-2021.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "Pakistan\u2019s national grid power generation in 1HFY26 remained 10 percent below the peak observed in 1HFY22. At 65 billion kilowatt hours, output was still lower than the same period in 2020, and only marginally higher than levels recorded in 2018 and 2019.\nDecember, however, stood out from the broader trend. It marked only the third instance in the past 18 months where actual generation exceeded reference generation.\nOn a year-on-year basis, December generation was up 9 percent, the strongest growth recorded so far in FY26. This improvement coincided with the introduction of the winter consumption incentive package, which became effective from December and appears to have played a meaningful role in lifting demand.\nThis is in addition to the ongoing reintegration of previously captive industrial consumers into the grid, which has resulted in industrial demand from the grid rising by as much as 35 percent year on year.\nDespite these tailwinds, cumulative generation in 1HFY26 improved by barely 1 percent compared to last year, implying a pronounced contraction in other demand segments, particularly domestic and agricultural consumption.\nWhile aggregate generation exceeded reference levels, the composition of supply presents a more instructive picture. Seasonal weakness in hydel output shifted the burden towards imported fuels.\nRLNG based generation was around 25 percent higher than planned, while imported coal recorded the most significant deviation. Actual coal-based generation rose to 860 million units against a reference of 422 million units. This reliance on costlier imported fuels largely explains the upward pressure seen in monthly fuel charge adjustments.\nDemand patterns are also reshaping operational dynamics. Evening demand spikes following sunset are becoming more pronounced, increasing reliance on RLNG and coal fired plants to meet short term load requirements. These plants are increasingly central to managing ramp up needs as the system adjusts to changing consumption behavior.\nWith the incremental consumption relief package for industry and agriculture now in place, the trajectory of grid demand will hinge to the extent to which these incentives translate into sustained usage.\nWhile industrial feedback has so far been sharply critical, this response may be overstated. With a substantial number of captive users already shifted back to the grid and incremental consumption priced at a meaningful discount, industrial demand should continue to strengthen, assuming no adverse policy or pricing shocks.",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is reportedly working on three proposals to reduce the industrial electricity tariff to 9 cents per kWh by eliminating cross-subsidy \u2014 one of the key demands of export-oriented industries for years,Business Recorderhas learnt from reliable sources.\nThe National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) determined the tariffs for distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs 33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs 34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26.\nFor industrial consumers, the B-2 ToU rate has been fixed at Rs 34.47/kWh, B-3 ToU at Rs 33.26/kWh, and B-4 ToU at Rs 33.04/kWh.\nThe government will notify revised tariffs after incorporating available subsidies in line with its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nLast month, the Power Division briefed the highest forum that industrial consumers are currently being charged a base variable rate of Rs 29.25 per unit against the Nepra-determined rate of Rs 23.88 per unit, effectively cross-subsidising domestic consumers by Rs 5.37 per unit.\nEliminating this cross-subsidy would require an additional budgetary allocation of Rs 160 billion per annum \u2014 Rs 131 billion for Discos and Rs 29 billion for K-Electric.\nExplaining the rationale, sources said the move would make Pakistani industry regionally competitive and encourage higher production and exports. More affordable and predictable electricity tariffs would promote higher capacity utilisation, formalisation of industrial activity, and reinvestment in existing facilities. The reform is also expected to improve power sector efficiency by reducing reliance on captive generation, strengthening grid demand, and promoting a transparent and equitable tariff structure \u2014 thereby supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation.\nBased on data from the past 50 years, the price elasticity of demand is estimated at 0.22 percent, meaning a Rs 1 per unit reduction in tariff results in additional consumption of 265 GWh. Accordingly, a Rs 5.37 per unit reduction is expected to increase industrial electricity consumption by at least 1,423 GWh. This incremental demand is projected to raise real GDP by Rs 360 billion and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 28.5 billion.\nThe overall fiscal impact of this proposal would be Rs 160 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.\nSources further noted that the power sector budget has been reduced from Rs 1,287 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs 893 billion in FY 2025-26 due to efficiency gains, and these savings should be utilised to enhance affordability and sustainability in the power sector.\nProposal 2\nAfter removal of cross-subsidy, the all-inclusive pre-tax industrial tariff would be Rs 31.34 per unit \u2014 comprising Rs 23.88 per unit variable charge, Rs 4.23 per unit fixed charge, and Rs 3.23 per unit DSS\u2014equivalent to around 11 cents per kWh (at an exchange rate of Rs 280). A further reduction of Rs 6.13 per unit would bring the final tariff down to 9 cents per kWh.\nThis would require an additional budgetary support of Rs 182 billion per annum \u2014Rs 150 billion for Discos and Rs 32 billion for K-Electric \u2014 through fiscalisation of power producers\u2019 debt, with the resulting generation cost relief ring-fenced for industrial consumers.\nIf approved, this proposal would restore industrial competitiveness, boost production and exports, and drive economic growth. Sources said reducing the final industrial tariff to 9 cents would significantly enhance the global competitiveness of Pakistan\u2019s export-oriented and energy-intensive sectors, encourage reinvestment and expansion, and reduce dependence on captive power generation. Fiscalising legacy power sector debt would separate past inefficiencies from current consumption decisions and strengthen confidence in the policy framework.\nA Rs 6.13 per unit tariff reduction is expected to increase industrial consumption by at least 1,624 GWh, raise real GDP by Rs 411 billion, and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 32.5 billion, with a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum.\nIf the first two proposals are approved, the industrial tariff would be fixed at Rs 25.21 per kWh (9 cents), requiring a total subsidy of Rs 342 billion. However, electricity consumption would increase by 3,047 GWh, real GDP would rise by Rs 771 billion, and additional tax revenue of Rs 61 billion would be generated.\nProposal 3\nThe third proposal relates to the inclusion of greenfield industries in the Grid Sustainability Package (GSP) 2025. The government has announced the GSP as a subsidy-neutral mechanism to unlock latent demand by offering electricity at the marginal cost of 8 cents per kWh for consumption above a defined baseline.\nWhile the IMF approved the GSP, it did not allow the discounted rate to apply to the entire consumption of greenfield industries. The Power Division has requested that discussions with the IMF be reopened to include greenfield industries in full, in order to ensure grid sustainability, enhance industrial competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth.\nThe Power Division believes that since the current tariff structure already ensures full recovery of fixed costs through base consumption, extending the GSP rate to the entire load of greenfield data centres, crypto-mining facilities, and copper and aluminium industries would not compromise cost recovery. IMF-approved safeguards \u2014 including a 25 percent cap on aggregate incremental consumption, semi-annual reviews, and a termination clause\u2014further mitigate fiscal and system-level risks.\nSources said these greenfield industries, particularly data centres and crypto-mining operations, have significant potential to absorb surplus power, improve system load factors, stabilise grid operations during low-demand periods, and strengthen the financial sustainability of the power sector.\nQuantitative analysis using macroeconomic indicators shows that each additional 1 GWh of electricity sales adds Rs 253 million to real GDP. Although aluminium smelting and copper refining are energy-intensive, they generate tradable output and strong local supply chains involving mining, logistics, and exports. While the economic productivity per unit of electricity is lower for data centres and crypto-mining, these sectors still contribute meaningfully to GDP growth and tax revenues.\nIf approved, this proposal would have a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

There is no telling at the moment how long it will take,\u201d site superintendent Takeyuki Inagaki told a news conference.\n\u201cWe will for now fully focus on trying to identify the cause of what happened,\u201d he said.The alarm that went off prompted TEPCO to \u201cinvestigate the malfunctioning electrical equipment,\u201d spokesman Takashi Kobayashi told AFP.\nAnd \u201conce it became clear that it would take time, we decided to reinsert the control rods in a planned manner\u201d, he said, adding that the reactor \u201cis stable and there is no radioactive impact outside\u201d.Control rods are a device used to control the nuclear chain reaction in the reactor core, which can be accelerated by slightly withdrawing them, or slowed down or stopped completely by inserting them deeper.\nThe restart, initially scheduled for Tuesday, had been pushed back after another technical issue related to the rods\u2019 removal was detected last weekend \u2014 a problem that was resolved on Sunday, according to TEPCO.\nKashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world\u2019s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.\nThe facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.\nHowever, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.\nKashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.\nPublic opinion in Niigata is deeply divided: Around 60 percent of residents oppose the restart, while 37 percent support it, according to a survey conducted in September.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Tokyo\u2019s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,\u201d Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, told AFP this week during a protest in front of the plant.",

According to him, industry is barely managing to carry its own burden, and this extra cost is pushing many units towards closure or long term contraction.\nS M Tanveer pointed out that over the past few years, the number of protected consumers has almost doubled, yet instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal space, the government has chosen the easier route of loading this burden onto industry. He said this policy effectively uses industry as a balancing item for systemic failures, even though industry is the only segment that consistently pays, consumes, and creates employment.\nHe strongly urged the government and the Minister for Energy Power Division to immediately remove cross subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs and to stop using industry as a substitute for fiscal reform.

      "fullText": "LAHORE: All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) has raised serious concerns over the current electricity pricing structure, warning that Pakistan\u2019s industrial base is being pushed toward irreparable decline due to unaffordable energy costs and an unsustainable cross-subsidy mechanism embedded in the national power tariff framework.\nTextile exports constituting more than 60 percent of Pakistan\u2019s total export have been drastically declining for the past five consecutive months, with a sharp 8 percent drop recorded in December 2025 alone, underscoring the immediate economic impact of these distortions.\nKamran Arshad Chairman APTMA addressing a largely attended Press Conference at Lahore criticised the government for not passing on to industrial consumers the benefit of a recent reduction in the base electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). He said that Power Division had maintained the industrial base tariff, citing a high number of domestic consumers receiving subsidised rates. Chairman APTMA said that costly electricity had crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector. He said that due to abnormally high power tariff around 150 large textile units have shutdown during the past two years rendering hundreds and thousands of workers jobless.\nKamran urged the government to abolish cross-subsidies imposed on industry and apply regionally competitive energy tariff to enable the local textile industry to compete in the global textile trade. He said that electricity tariffs for large-scale industrial consumers in Pakistan remain significantly higher than those in regional competitive economies, where electricity tariff for industrial usage ranges from \u00a25 to 7.5 /kWh. In contrast, the effective tariff for Pakistani industries is more than \u00a212/ kWh. This disparity is a core reason for the erosion of Pakistan\u2019s export competitiveness, as the cross subsidy is a hidden tax that cannot be exported.\nKamran said that the centre of the issue is the policy of cross-subsidisation, whereby industrial consumers are compelled to bear the cost of subsidies provided to other consumer categories. Regulatory filings and official disclosures show that the power sector will require a subsidy of Rs629 billion in 2026, while the Federal allocation stands at just Rs248 billion. The shortfall of Rs381 billion is being recovered through cross-subsidisation from industrial and other consumers.\nAsad Shafi Chairman APTMA North strongly opposed levy of hidden tax on industry and exports in the name of cross subsidy. He demanded that social subsidies for lifeline and protected consumers must be transparently funded by the state through the federal or provincial budgets. Shifting this financial obligation to the industrial sector undermines manufacturing, exports, employment, and investment at a time when Pakistan\u2019s economy cannot afford further setbacks.\nAsad added that the current Time-of-Use (ToU) tariff regime is outdated and misaligned with actual demand patterns. Peak pricing hours no longer correspond with true peak system load, making the framework both economically inefficient and operationally irrational. The elevated peak-hour rates disrupt industrial load planning, raise operational costs, and discourage grid consumption at times when capacity is underutilized. Additionally, it incentivizes a shift toward solar and battery storage systems, further undermining demand for grid-supplied power. He strongly urged for elimination of the peak hours tariff for industrial consumers in favour of a single, flat rate.\nAsad said that the industry is already operating under high-cost conditions, with high interest rates, high tax rates, and global economic volatility. The added burden of inflated power tariffs has made many manufacturing operations financially unviable, leading to massive shut down and scaling back of operations.\nOther leading textile exporters, speaking on the occasion called for the immediate rationalization of power tariffs by removal of cross-subsidy and aligning of energy tariffs with regionally competitive levels of not more than \u00a27.5/ kWh. Doing so will restore export competitiveness, upsurge investments, improve capacity utilization and create millions of jobs. Furthermore, a cost-of-service based tariff regime would enhance electricity demand, improve generation utilization, and further reduce per-unit costs, leading to system-wide efficiency gains.\nMeanwhile, SM Tanveer, Leader of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI), has expressed concerns over reliance on remittances and debt-driven consumption, and not exports, for economic growth and development.\nHe highlighted the challenges facing Pakistan\u2019s exports, citing an estimated USD60 billion gap in potential exports.\nIn a statement, Tanveer noted that Pakistan\u2019s export share in GDP has declined from 16 percent in the 1990s to 10.4 percent in 2024.\nOn the contrary, he said, Vietnam\u2019s export-to-GDP ratio is 95 percent. Bangladesh, a country we used to look down on is around 20 percent. Thailand\u2019s at 60 percent.\nHe identified high production costs, limited market access, low productivity, and inadequate infrastructure as key factors contributing to this issue.\n\u201cPakistan\u2019s exports are facing significant challenges, and it is imperative that we address these issues to unlock the country\u2019s true potential,\u201d Tanveer said. \u201cWe need to adopt a market-determined exchange rate, strengthen trade finance, improve logistics and compliance, and enhance trade agreements to boost our exports.\u201d\nTanveer emphasized the need for a comprehensive strategy to promote exports and reduce reliance on imports. \u201cWe must work together to create a business-friendly environment, invest in infrastructure, and promote innovation and value addition in our export-oriented sectors,\u201d he added.\nThe FPCCI leader urged the government to take concrete steps to address the challenges facing Pakistan\u2019s exports and unlocks the country\u2019s potential for growth and development.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: A bullish trend prevailed in quality cotton prices at the Karachi Cotton Exchange, where an increase of three hundred to five hundred rupees per maund was recorded, although trading volume remained limited.\nRenowned industrialist S M Tanveer, and President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry Atif Ikram Sheikh has issued a warning stating that nearly the entire industrial sector, including textile and spinning, has reached the ventilator and there is an urgent need to impose an economic emergency in the country.\nRenowned industrialist Gohar Ejaz has stated that the cross-subsidy on electricity for industries is tantamount to a death warrant.\nREAD MORE:APTMA Cotton Revival Plan: Agri dept delegation visits APTMA\nA mixed trend was observed at Heimtextil, the international home textile exhibition held in Germany. Pakistani trader Muhammad Adil Usawala, present at the exhibition, reported that Pakistani companies are expected to receive reasonable orders.\nMeanwhile, a dispute continues over the building of the Karachi Cotton Association, where the Evacuee Property Trust Board has taken control of the Karachi Cotton Exchange building with the assistance of the Federal Investigation Agency since December thirteenth.\nThe 320 registered cotton brokers and tenants of the Karachi Cotton Association are demanding that their offices be opened and they be allowed to issue daily cotton spot rates, as business is being severely affected due to the closure of spot rates. The closure of business worth millions of rupees conducted daily at the Karachi Cotton Association is causing immense financial losses, while approximately five thousand people have become jobless and unemployed.\nDuring the past week, quality cotton prices in the local cotton market increased by 300 to 500 rupees per maund. Textile and spinning mills are showing interest in purchasing quality cotton. Due to the daily decline in quality cotton stock, ginners are demanding higher rates which had resulted in the recorded price increase. The arrival of raw cotton has virtually stopped, and the business volume remains limited.\nOn another front, the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), with assistance from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), took possession of the Karachi Cotton Exchange building on December 13 and sealed the entire building. A total of 209 business offices, including those of 320 registered cotton brokers located in the building, have also been sealed. This has brought daily business worth millions of rupees to a standstill. The 320 cotton brokers and other tenants have been left helpless and without support, resulting in approximately 5,000 people becoming unemployed and without work.\nKarachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab has filed a case in the Sindh High Court on behalf of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), claiming that the Karachi Cotton Exchange building is the property of KMC. The Karachi Cotton Exchange has deposited its lease with KMC until 2081. The Sindh High Court has issued a stay order. The 320 cotton brokers and tenants state that this is a mutual dispute between KMC, ETPB, and the Karachi Cotton Association, but they question why the cotton brokers\u2019 offices have been sealed.\nThe Home Textile Exhibition held in Frankfurt, Germany, witnessed participation from approximately 3,000 companies representing 66 countries. Attendance on the second day of the exhibition showed improvement compared to the first day, indicating growing interest among industry stakeholders.\nA significant number of Pakistani home textile producers participated in the exhibition as exhibitors. The Pakistani contingent included prominent manufacturers such as Gul Ahmed Textile, Feroze 1888, Younus Textile, Zaman Textile, Alkaram Towel, Naveena Exports, Liberty, Orient, Fashion Net, Mustaqeem, Meco, Fazal Cloth, Fazal Cotton, Kohinoor, Nishat Group, Alkaram, and several other established institutions from the country\u2019s textile sector.\nThe robust attendance observed on the second day has generated optimism among industry participants. There are expectations that Pakistan will secure substantial orders from international buyers, which would provide positive support to the Pakistani economy during these times.\nIn domestic market developments, cotton prices in Punjab and Sindh provinces have experienced an increase ranging from 300 to 500 rupees per maund, depending on quality and payment conditions. Current rates are now running between 14,500 to 16,900 rupees per maund across these regions.\nMeanwhile, prices for cottonseed, cottonseed cake, and cottonseed oil have remained stable in the market.\nKarachi Cotton Brokers Forum Chairman Naseem Usman has reported that international cotton prices showed a mixed trend. The New York cotton futures price is currently trading between 65 to 68 American cents per pound.\nMeanwhile, textile exports are continuously declining, which is a serious issue, according to the APTMA Chairman. Kamran Arshad, Chairman of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, has stated that textile exports are continuously declining, and this is a serious problem that poses a threat to Pakistan\u2019s industry, economy, and employment.\nWhile addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the Chairman of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association said that textile exports have been decreasing from October to December, with textile exports falling by 8.55 percent in December alone.\nHe mentioned that the textile industry accounts for a 60 percent share in the country\u2019s exports. The tariff for domestic industries has reached 34 rupees, and industries cannot operate under this tariff regime. The burden of other consumers is being placed on the industries, and the burden of cross subsidy is being imposed on the industrial sector.\nThe chairman stated that the load factor of power plants that are operational should be examined, while charges are also being collected for power plants that are not even running.\nFurthermore, former federal minister for Commerce and Patron-in-Chief of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA), Dr Gohar Ejaz, has warned the government in unequivocal terms that Pakistan\u2019s industrial sector has reached the brink of a severe crisis, as the escalating costs of electricity and gas continue to undermine the competitiveness of Pakistani products in international markets. He stated that Pakistan is rapidly losing its export orders to regional competitor countries where electricity rates average around 9 US cents per unit, whereas Pakistani industry has to pay 12 cents or more. He emphasised that no exporter can operate with such structural weakness, noting that success or failure in the global market today is determined by energy costs, and unfortunately Pakistan is losing this battle.\nMeanwhile, according to informed sources, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) is holding a meeting with business leaders today (Thursday), where concerns regarding taxes as high as 60 percent, poor governance, and excessive energy costs will reportedly be heard.\nAdditionally, the Pakistan Textile Council has written to the government demanding the elimination of the 160 billion rupees electricity cross-subsidy and surcharge. The council argues that unnecessary additional electricity charges on the industry have significantly increased production costs, thereby weakening exports and affecting the country\u2019s export competitiveness.\nThe industry also objects that factories required to operate in three shifts are paying more expensive electricity due to the Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff structure. The council has expressed concern that if immediate action is not taken, exports will decline further and losses in the textile sector will increase. The entire textile industry is linked to cotton production.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

Proposed amendments to the power sector laws risk undermining this institutional design. The writer is an avid power sector expert and a leading industrialist from Karachi.",
      "fullText": "Independent regulation is not a technical formality; it is the foundation of a credible and functional power sector. This is why the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority was created as an autonomous regulator, operating at arm\u2019s length from the executive. Its purpose was to ensure that tariff determination and regulatory decisions are based on law, technical analysis, and transparency, rather than short-term administrative or fiscal pressures.\nThe recent proposed amendments to the power sector laws, which shift key approval and notification powers from the federal government to the Power Division, risk undermining this institutional design.\nWhile framed as procedural adjustments, their practical effect is a concentration of regulatory influence within the bureaucracy. This represents a move away from rule-based regulation toward administrative discretion, which is neither healthy nor sustainable for a sector as complex and capital intensive as power.\nHistorically, tariff notification under Section 31 involved federal government oversight, which implied collective responsibility and an additional layer of accountability. Replacing this framework with authority vested in the \u201cdivision concerned\u201d raises legitimate questions about concentration of power and transparency. Regulatory decisions require insulation from departmental priorities, particularly where those priorities are shaped by subsidy management and short-term fiscal constraints.\nIt is important to state clearly that this concern is not political in nature. It\u2019s all about the core function of Nepra, consumer and sector protection. The current political leadership has made sincere efforts to rationalize costs in the power sector, and whatever tariff relief has been achieved in recent months has largely been driven by ministerial intent. Those efforts deserve acknowledgment.\nHowever, despite these initiatives, government departments have still been unable to deliver electricity to industry at competitive levels. The continued inability to move toward tariffs around 9 cents per unit remains a serious concern for industrial sustainability and export competitiveness.\nThis gap between intent and outcome highlights a deeper institutional issue. Power Division departments appear increasingly focused on managing subsidies and fiscal exposure, often through decisions that shift costs rather than eliminate inefficiencies which often comes as an additional and social cost on industrial tariff. While fiscal pressures are real, they cannot justify weakening the regulator.\nAn independent regulator exists precisely to balance cost recovery, efficiency, consumer protection, and long- term sector health, even when such decisions are administratively uncomfortable.\nIf there is concern that regulatory decisions require closer scrutiny or improved consistency, the solution does not lie in curtailing regulatory independence.\nThe appropriate response is to strengthen oversight, not control. A neutral and professional regulatory oversight board can be established to review regulatory performance, track outcomes, and ensure accountability without interfering in decision making authority.\nSuch a mechanism would restore checks and balances while preserving institutional credibility. It would allow policymakers to evaluate whether regulatory decisions are delivering intended outcomes, while maintaining a clear separation between policy formulation, regulation, and execution. This separation is essential for investor confidence, consumer trust, and long-term stability of the power sector.\nThe recent proposed amendments risk weakening what remains of regulatory independence at a time when the sector requires stronger institutions, not centralized discretion. Sustainable reform demands respect for institutional roles, transparent oversight, and clear boundaries.\nUndermining the regulator may offer short-term administrative comfort, but it carries long-term costs that the power sector and the broader economy can ill afford.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nRehan Javed\nThe writer is an avid power sector expert and a leading industrialist from Karachi.

      "fullText": "Weak performance by Pakistan\u2019s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country\u2019s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.\nThe report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with \u201crigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)\u201d to reduce tariffs were a milestone.\nHowever, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.\n\u201cOverall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,\u201d the report read.\nRead more:ECC approves Rs659.65bn govt guarantee for circular debt financing\nThe regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the \u201cold era of scarcity is ending\u201d, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might \u201cprove to be even more complex\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.\nIn its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.\nMeanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the \u2018Take or Pay\u2019 electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.\nNEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.\n\u201cA significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan\u2019s power system.\u201d\nThe regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.\n\u201cIt remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.\u201d\nOn the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.\nRead more:Circular debt rose Rs79bn on \u2018seasonable, operational factors\u2019: Power Division\nAt the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.\n\u201cGovernance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan\u2019s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,\u201d the NEPRA report said.\nKE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.\nIn contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.\nQESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.\nIn terms of recovery, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) was the best-placed DISCO with a recovery rate of 101.7%, followed by GEPCO and LESCO.",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: An assessment of Pakistan\u2019s power sector during FY 2024-25 prompted National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to observe that despite several structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remains limited and insufficient to inspire confidence in the sector\u2019s ability to support sustained industrial growth or provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential segments.\nIn its State of the Industry Report 2024-25, NEPRA stated that the power sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain efficiency and undermine its contribution to economic development.\nThe regulator emphasized that power sector entities must operate under commercially binding agreements that clearly define roles, performance standards, and accountability mechanisms.\nREAD MORE:NEPRA could come under Power Division\u2019s control, as per govt\u2019s latest amendments\nEach entity should bear the financial consequences of its inefficiencies rather than passing these costs on to consumers, who are currently burdened with approximately Rs233 billion in Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS)\u2014a cost arising not from normal business operations but from inefficiencies within certain sector entities.\nAccording to the report, generation capacity under \u201cTake or Pay\u201d contracts remains significantly underutilized, resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants. Simultaneously, the transmission network is both constrained and underutilized, contributing to higher transmission tariffs and preventing the dispatch of cheaper and more efficient electricity in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).\nOn the distribution side, several government-owned DISCOs continue to suffer from poor governance, with transmission and distribution (T&D) losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery, and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. These inefficiencies further exacerbate asset underutilisation across generation, transmission, and distribution, while fueling the circular debt problem.\nNepra noted that challenges faced by power sector entities\u2014largely government-owned\u2014span planning, execution, and operational domains.\nPersistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered financial sustainability and limited the sector\u2019s contribution to economic growth. Weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management further constrain the sector\u2019s ability to provide reliable and affordable electricity.\nDuring FY 2024-25, efforts were made to reduce \u201cTake or Pay\u201d generation capacity through the retirement or decommissioning of inefficient power plants with consistently low utilisation. As a result, 2,829 MW of capacity was retired, decommissioned, or had its Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) terminated.\nConsequently, effective operational generation capacity declined to 41,121 MW as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888 MW a year earlier. However, 884 MW of new hydropower capacity\u2014Suki Kinari Hydropower Project\u2014was added during the year.\nThe utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the CPPA-G system remained 38.82%. NEPRA highlighted that generation costs account for nearly 82% of the electricity tariff. During FY 2024-25, the actual per-unit Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) stood at Rs14.21/kWh, the highest component of the electricity tariff, primarily due to underutilisation of \u201cTake or Pay\u201d plants.\nDuring the year, several power plants approached NEPRA through CPPA-G seeking reductions in generation tariffs. Approval of these adjustments is expected to yield long-term benefits by lowering generation costs, improving tariff efficiency, and stabilizing consumer prices, while also supporting investor confidence through a predictable regulatory environment.\nHowever, NEPRA noted that persistent inefficiencies in public sector power plants \u2014 such as the 747 MW Guddu Power Plant, 969 MW Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, and several WAPDA-operated hydro plants\u2014are undermining tariff reduction efforts. These inefficiencies result in lower utilisation, higher costs, and reduced system efficiency, offsetting gains from IPP tariff reductions and plant retirements.\nThe Part Load Adjustment Charges (PLAC) added Rs46.388 billion to generation costs in FY 2024-25, compared to Rs55.671 billion in 2023-24, and, while unavoidable, these costs can be significantly reduced through effective demand-side management.\nSimilarly, Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) costs declined to Rs13.285 billion, from Rs39.521 billion, though NEPRA said further reductions are possible through better grid management.\nLower utilisation of Thar coal-based power plants, which operated at 67.23% utilisation, also raised generation costs by inflating both CPP and Energy Purchase Price (EPP). Delays in ensuring regular coal supply to Lucky Electric Power Company further exacerbated inefficiencies.\nNepra observed widespread underutilisation of transmission assets, including the 4,000 MW Matiari\u2013Lahore HVDC line, which operated at just 35% utilisation despite payments based on full availability. Manual system logs further hinder accurate assessment of transmission performance.\nThe poor performance of the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) has led to violations of the economic merit order, increased generation costs, project delays, and cost overruns. Delays in key projects\u2014including KE-NGC interconnection, Lahore North Grid, and SCADA-III\u2014have adversely affected system reliability and finances.\nGovernance remains the most critical issue confronting DISCOs. KE, PESCO, HESCO, SEPCO, and QESCO were identified as the poorest performers, with excessive losses, low recovery, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Except for TESCO, no DISCO met Nepra-approved T&D loss targets.\nWeak DISCO performance contributed approximately Rs397 billion to circular debt during the year. Nepra termed load-shedding based on AT&C losses unlawful and inequitable, as it penalizes compliant consumers and deepens sector inefficiencies.\nRising electricity costs and poor service have pushed consumers\u2014particularly affluent ones\u2014towards rooftop solar PV systems and battery storage, reducing grid demand during non-solar hours.\nNepra also expressed concern over the underperformance of the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO), citing limited adoption of modern technologies and the absence of a fully functional SCADA system.\nThe regulator concluded that Pakistan\u2019s power sector transformation remains incomplete without full implementation of the 1992 WAPDA Restructuring Plan, emphasizing corporatization, decentralization, privatization, and separation of policy, regulation, and operations. Continued centralized control, overlapping mandates, and weak accountability, it warned, will perpetuate inefficiencies and impose unnecessary financial burdens on the economy.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "summary": "Nepra says K-Electric has no role in the accumulation of circular debt. But consumers are nonetheless paying a Debt Servicing Surcharge of Rs3.23 per kWh. As of June 30, 2025, circular debt in Nepra attributed this reduction to the Government of Pakistan securing commercial financing to retire liabilities of Power Holding (Private) Limited. While this intervention temporarily lowered circular debt, it failed to address the sector\u2019s underlying inefficiencies. Nepra data shows that KE has recorded a sustained decline in transmission and distribution losses since its privatization in 2005. Nepra attributed this long-term reduction to improved governance mechanisms and greater operational accountability following privatization.",
      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: While acknowledging that K-Electric has no role in the accumulation of circular debt, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has noted that KE consumers are nonetheless paying a Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per kWh, highlighting the inequitable burden of sector inefficiencies on electricity users.\nNepra stated that despite determining consumer-end tariffs in a manner that fully covers the revenue requirements of all entities across the power supply chain, persistent structural inefficiencies and the historical poor performance of distribution companies (Discos) leave little reason to expect that circular debt can be sustainably controlled.\nThe regulator explained that if NEPRA-determined tariffs were fully implemented and all sector entities met prescribed performance targets, each entity\u2019s financial obligations would be met and circular debt would not arise.\nREAD MORE:Govt wants to alter KE consumer-end tariff as per Nepra fixation\nHowever, in practice, several power sector entities fail to achieve these targets due to weak governance, poor recovery performance, and high technical and commercial losses, resulting in insufficient revenue collection and the continued accumulation of circular debt.\nAs of June 30, 2025, circular debt in Pakistan\u2019s power sector stood at approximately Rs1.614 trillion, compared to Rs2.393 trillion a year earlier, reflecting a reduction of around Rs780 billion. Nepra noted, however, that this decline does not represent a structural improvement and mirrors similar short-term reductions seen in the past.\nAccording to Nepra, both current and previous declines in circular debt primarily resulted from external financial injections rather than from meaningful sector reforms. During FY 2024-25, DISCO inefficiencies contributed approximately Rs265 billion through excessive T&D losses and Rs132 billion due to low recovery ratios. Despite these shortcomings, the overall circular debt figure declined during the year.\nNepra attributed this reduction to the Government of Pakistan securing commercial financing to retire liabilities of Power Holding (Private) Limited (PHPL) and clear arrears owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). While this intervention temporarily lowered circular debt, it failed to address the sector\u2019s underlying inefficiencies.\nTo service the cost of this borrowing, most electricity consumers \u2014 excluding a few protected domestic categories\u2014are now required to pay an additional Rs3.23 per kWh under the Debt Servicing Surcharge for several years. Nepra noted that this surcharge effectively transfers the burden of sector inefficiencies to consumers and represents one of the largest components of the end-user tariff, after the Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) and Energy Purchase Price (EPP).\nNepra further stated that KE, the country\u2019s only private-sector distribution company, does not contribute to circular debt, as it absorbs the financial impact of higher losses and lower recoveries instead of passing these costs on to consumers. Despite this, KE consumers remain subject to the DSS. To date, KE has collected and remitted Rs35.76 billion under the DSS to the Government of Pakistan and CPPA-G.\nThe regulator observed that had public-sector Discos been privatized in line with the 1992 power sector reform strategy, trillions of rupees in losses could have been avoided, and consumers would have benefited from improved service quality. Nepra added that although challenges to privatization persist even after more than two decades, these hurdles can be overcome through well-designed strategies and firm political commitment.\nGiven the prevailing structural inefficiencies and the historical performance of Discos, Nepra concluded that there is little justification to expect sustainable control of circular debt or lasting improvements in the power sector under the existing framework.\nREAD MORE:Consumers of KE, others: Govt to pass on Rs53.4bn relief under QTA for Q4\u201925\nNepra data shows that KE has recorded a sustained decline in transmission and distribution losses since its privatization in 2005, when losses were reported at around 40 percent. By FY 2024-25, KE\u2019s losses had fallen to below 15 percent, a level that remains above ideal benchmarks but is significantly lower than those observed across several public-sector Discos. The regulator attributed this long-term reduction to improved governance mechanisms and greater operational accountability following privatization.\nIn its assessment of recovery performance, Nepra observed that KE absorbed the impact of recovery shortfalls internally rather than transferring the burden to the power supply chain. While KE consumers continued to pay the federally imposed Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS), under which Rs. 35.76 billion was collected during the year, the utility itself did not add to sector-wide payment arrears, distinguishing its financial treatment from that of government-owned Discos.\nReferring to broader sector reforms, Nepra noted that KE\u2019s post-privatization experience illustrates the potential benefits of reduced government control, including greater financial discipline and operational responsiveness. However, the regulator cautioned that KE\u2019s performance should be viewed as part of a wider reform discussion rather than an isolated solution, emphasising that comprehensive structural changes across all distribution companies would be required to achieve sustainable sector-wide improvement.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority\u2019s (NEPRA) State of the Industry Report is its flagship publication. It released last Friday, covered the period between July 2024 and June 2025, and earned widespread coverage.\nWithin its content, one thing was clear: efforts are being made to revitalize the sector, negotiations are being re-done, contracts re-inked, and a general feel of overhaul is being instilled. But findings of the report suggest somewhat otherwise.\nWhen you study the report, especially in the backdrop of a presentation made to the finance ministry a few days earlier, you realise one simple point: Pakistan\u2019s power sector \u2013 despite all the efforts (talk, more than actual on-ground improvement) is still a mess. It will take years of concerted effort, policymaking, provincial coordination, protests, sacrifices, and still some more to first stop the bleeding, begin the healing before a recovery can be shown. But the energy ministry, like any company CEO, is eager to show results.\nLet\u2019s begin by examining the accounts presented to Q block, the arm of the federal government responsible for allocating finances, budgeting, and then understanding the revenue side of things. Overall, FY25\u2019s revenues were down, and so were profits. For an ex-president of a major bank, the finance minister must have started paying closer attention. The presentation then states net losses are up 301%, a net financial deteriorating that indicates value destruction at the portfolio level.\nREAD MORE:Power sector: Nepra sees \u2018limited\u2019 progress despite fixes\nAmong the nine sectors that the government owns, power sector was the only with negative equity. It was second worst when it came to overall losses suffered (infrastructure and transport won the race). But the true highlight was the remark that it has an \u201cunsustainable business model\u201d.\nBut this isn\u2019t the shocking bit. What\u2019s shocking is that in the backdrop of so-called improvement in performance and the constant remarks that the sector is being overhauled and the decline has been arrested comes the revelation that power sector\u2019s losses are up 9% during FY25.\nHigh tariffs, reduction in circular debt, reforms etc and all the other claims still took the losses to Rs242 billion. Among the worst DISCO was QESCO, followed by PESCO, SEPCO, HESCO, LESCO, and then IESCO.\nWhile it may be the best-performing among its universe, IESCO still incurred a loss of Rs1.4 billion, taking its accumulated losses to Rs133.7 billion. In the remarks, it says its cost base remains high. We wonder why.\nWhen it comes to the SOI report, IESCO, which is in the top tier when it comes to controlling transmission/distribution loss and has kept its recovery nearly 435 basis points above the average recovery rate, has shown impressive results. Its financial impact, still, on the account of just these two overheads runs close to Rs10 billion combined.\nOverall, the gap between the average transmission and distribution losses of all DISCOs and the allowed benchmark by NEPRA is 612 basis points. One admits that it has come down from last-year\u2019s difference of 654 basis points, but even then, it points to one simple argument: on-ground improvements have not happened.\nThe government, with all its might and negotiations, still has work to do when it comes to privatising its DISCOs.",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released a damning report on the performance of the power sector in spite of several structural and policy level interventions that included renegotiating the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) contracts signed by previous administrations (though the 2014 contracts signed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remain effective to this day) that inordinately favoured the producers with the take-or-pay option envisaging capacity payments which, in turn, escalated as and when solar panels were encouraged as part of the government\u2019s efforts to shift towards renewables as part of reforms to withstand the climate change impacts.\nIn addition, Nepra noted that distribution companies continued to suffer from poor governance with transmission and distribution losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses. Reference was also made to Debt Service Surcharge sourced to poor governance of the power sub-sectors that accounts for higher utility tariffs with industry lamenting the fact that cross subsidies have made the cost of energy as an input into their production process much higher than the regional average, which is the reason behind the decline in exports. Circular debt, the report further noted, has risen.\nThe report undermines Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s repeated appreciation of the power sector team that perhaps prompted the Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari to publicly reject the report maintaining that it is \u201cbased on incomplete and inaccurate data which has led to widespread misunderstandings\u2026circular debt has not increased, instead for the first time a significant reduction is recorded\u2026it (circular debt) declined from 2.4 trillion rupees to 1.6 trillion rupees.\u201d The government, he said, is embarked on a six-year programme to completely eliminate circular debt which includes cancellation of 8,000MW costly projects that saved the country USD 17 billion (a saving that is not realised because the project never got off the ground) and to exclude commercial losses-based load-shedding was incorrect.\nIt has been widely reported that the government has taken 1.25 trillion rupee loans from the commercial banking sector at rates below the amount parked in the Holding Company, given the decline in the discount rate from 22 percent in 2022 to 10.5 percent today. Borrowing at lower rates to retire previous loans incurred at higher rates is welcome though ignored is the fact that borrowing that reflects poor performance and is to be payable by the hapless consumers is hardly likely to provide a comfort level to the general public.\nREAD MORE:Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report\nThe Power Minister lamented the fact that Nepra did not take into account the data provided by his Ministry \u2014 a claim that is baffling given that regulatory authorities, like Nepra and Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority), are set up to protect the consumers and not to synchronise their data with that released by the political government. Additionally, regulatory bodies safeguard public welfare and ensure quality product service while preventing fraud and anti-competitive practices.\nRegulatory authorities provide crucial benefits by safeguarding public welfare through consumer protection, ensuring product/service quality, promoting fair competition, preventing fraud/anti-competitive practices, and establishing clear frameworks for industries, leading to greater trust, market efficiency, innovation, and economic stability. It is therefore very concerning from a consumer perspective that the government has reportedly finalised amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 aimed at making Nepra subordinate to the Power Division \u2014 a report that has not been denied by the government to-date.\nTo conclude, regulatory bodies like Nepra perform a very critical function and must be allowed to continue to protect consumer interests. The incumbent government\u2019s muzzling of several entities tasked to provide a service to the general public through legislation must be abandoned in favour of a more open and participatory discharge of functions that can lay the foundation of a system capable of evolving into one where borrowing would no longer be required.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "Weak performance by Pakistan\u2019s power distribution companies (DISCOs) contributed to a Rs397 billion increase in the country\u2019s circular debt during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said in its State of the Industry Report 2025 released on Friday.\nThe report highlighted that efforts to rationalise and retire comparatively high-cost, underutilised generation capacity coupled with \u201crigorous negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)\u201d to reduce tariffs were a milestone.\nHowever, it cautioned that the energy sector had deep-rooted inefficiencies, inadequate planning, lack of digitised and reliable data, and weak governance was among other causes of concern.\n\u201cOverall, weak DISCO performance is a major contributor to circular debt, adding approximately Rs397 billion during the reporting period [FY25]. Load-shedding based on high AT&C [Aggregate Technical & Commercial] losses is both unlawful and inequitable, unfairly penalising compliant consumers while underutilising Take or Pay generation capacity and deepening inefficiencies across the power sector,\u201d the report read.\nRead more:ECC approves Rs659.65bn govt guarantee for circular debt financing\nThe regulator also added that the sector stood at an inflection point with the \u201cold era of scarcity is ending\u201d, but the new era, defined by surplus capacity, structural cost pressures, and shifting demand might \u201cprove to be even more complex\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persist across all DISCOs, including K-Electric (KE). Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals are common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermine consumer trust.\nIn its detailed assessment, NEPRA also stated that despite structural and policy-level interventions, overall progress remained limited and insufficient.\nMeanwhile, total generation capacity decreased to 41,121 megawatts (MW) at the end of FY25, from 45,888MW at the end of FY24, largely due to efforts to reduce the \u2018Take or Pay\u2019 electric power generation capacity by retiring or decommissioning inefficient power plants.\nNEPRA also stressed that the poor performance of National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) was not only affecting its own transmission tariff, but also increasing overall generation cost.\n\u201cA significant number of constraints in the NGC system is forcing power plants to operate in violation of the economic merit order. It has been observed that every transmission project is faced with delays and cost overruns. Among these, the delay in completing the interconnection between K-Electric and NGC systems, the Lahore-North Grid, and other associated transmission lines has severely affected Pakistan\u2019s power system.\u201d\nThe regulator added that since majority of DISCOs operate under the public sector and remain owned by the federal government, even after more than two decades of incorporation as companies, they had largely failed to function as true corporate entities.\n\u201cIt remains unclear whether these DISCOs themselves are unwilling to operate independently or whether their owners are reluctant to promote them as such. However, it has been observed that they are increasingly being brought under centralised control previously under PEPCO [Pakistan Electric Power Company] and now under Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC). The Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organizations of international standard. Furthermore, there is a lack of accountability for BoD members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector.\u201d\nOn the data side, average transmission and distribution (T&D) loss (electricity lost in transit and due to theft) stood at 17.4% in the reported period, down from 18.31% in the previous year. However, in both years, all entities were below the NEPRA-allowed benchmark of 11.43% in FY25, and 11.77% in FY24.\nRead more:Circular debt rose Rs79bn on \u2018seasonable, operational factors\u2019: Power Division\nAt the same time, recoveries (the other aspect of commercial losses) on the part of DISCOs were down Rs132.5 billion, while KE alone failed to recover Rs74.6 billion. However, NEPRA noted that KE absorbs the financial impact of its losses being a private entity. Hence, the regulator argued that privatisation of Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) represented a necessary corrective step.\n\u201cGovernance remains the most critical challenge confronting Pakistan\u2019s DISCOs. KE, PESCO [Peshawar Electric Supply Company], HESCO [Hyderabad Electric Supply Company], SEPCO [Sukkur Electric Power Company], and QESCO [Quetta Electric Supply Company] are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding NEPRA limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators,\u201d the NEPRA report said.\nKE recorded actual losses of 14.74% against an allowed 14.58%, while FESCO missed its benchmark by only 0.64%.\nIn contrast, PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and HESCO continued to record the widest deviations from allowed targets, with PESCO alone causing a fiscal cost of Rs87.5 billion.\nQESCO and SEPCO contributed a loss of Rs52.4 billion and Rs36.0 billion, respectively. Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), despite some improvement from FY24, still recorded actual losses of 13.70% versus an allowed 9.46%, resulting in a Rs35.2 billion fiscal impact.\nIn terms of recovery, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) was the best-placed DISCO with a recovery rate of 101.7%, followed by GEPCO and LESCO.",

On Sunday, in a rare development, sitting Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari publicly rebutted figures presented in Nepra\u2019s State of Industry Report 2024\u201325.\n\u201cThe World Bank has held one meeting with the concerned authorities and conveyed its concerns regarding the proposed replacement of the term \u2018Federal Government\u2019 with Division\u2019. Another meeting is expected in the coming days,\u201d the sources added.\nThe country\u2019s business community and industrial sector have also expressed serious concerns over the Power Division\u2019s move, warning that it could force the regulator to compromise its independence.\nAccording to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also taken notice of the Power Division\u2019s move regarding amendments to the Nepra Act.\n\u201cThe prime minister has directed the Power minister to discuss the matter with him,\u201d the sources quoted the PM Office as saying.\nSection 3(a) of the Act empowers the Authority to determine tariffs, rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services by generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and to recommend these to the relevant division for notification.\nUnder the revised Section 31(7), notification of Nepra-approved tariffs or uniform tariffs \u2014 along with rates, charges, and other terms and conditions for the supply of electric power services\u2014shall be made in the official Gazette by the division concerned within 30 days of intimation by the Authority.\nREAD MORE:Nepra approves uniform national average tariff, ignoring industry and export sector concerns\nIf the division fails to notify the tariff or refer the matter back to Nepra for reconsideration within the specified timeframe, the Authority may direct immediate application of its approved tariff through notification, subject to any subsequent adjustments arising from reconsideration requested by the Division.\nSection 31(7)(i) provides that the division concerned may, within 30 days of receiving Nepra\u2019s intimation regarding approved tariffs of public-sector distribution and supply licensees, require the Authority to reconsider its determination on issues common to these licensees. The Nepra would then be required to complete the reconsideration within 30 days and inform the division accordingly.\nUnder Section 31(7)(ii), the Nepra may make quarterly tariff adjustments within 15 days on account of capacity and transmission charges, transmission and distribution losses, variable operation and maintenance costs, and policy guidelines issued by the division concerned.\nThe adjusted tariff would be intimated to the division prior to Gazette notification. The division may seek reconsideration within 15 days, failing which Nepra shall notify the adjusted tariff in the official Gazette. If reconsideration is sought, the Nepra must decide the matter within 15 days and intimate the division before notification.\nSection 31(7)(iii) allows the division concerned, in lieu of seeking reconsideration, to file an appeal. However, once a reconsideration request is filed, the Power Division will not be entitled to subsequently appeal the decision on that reconsideration. No changes have been proposed to Section 31(7)(iv).\nSimilarly, amendments have been proposed to the Electricity Act, 1910, replacing the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cappropriate authority\u201d or \u201cdivision concerned.\u201d\nUnder the revised Section 32(2), any dispute between an operator and the telegraph authority regarding the placement or operation of electric supply lines shall be referred to the division concerned, which may direct the operator to make necessary alterations to comply with the law. Amendments to Section 53(1)(a) relate to the service of notices, orders, or documents, stipulating that where the addressee is the Federal or Provincial Government, such service shall be made at the office designated by the division concerned.\nBusiness Recordersent few questions to Power Division. Questions and their response are as follows\nThe primary purpose of the proposed amendments is to remove procedural difficulties and avoid unnecessary administrative delays. Following the Mustafa Impex judgment, the Federal Cabinet directed all ministries to review existing laws, rules, and regulations to ensure that routine and technical matters are not escalated to the Cabinet where such escalation is not required. Accordingly, the amendments mainly replace the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d with \u201cconcerned Division\u201d in limited procedural contexts to streamline filings, notifications, and technical reviews, without altering the substantive regulatory framework.\nNo. This understanding is incorrect. The amendments do not make Nepra subordinate to the Power Division in any manner. The Nepra remains an independent statutory regulator, administratively reporting to the Federal Cabinet. No changes have been proposed that require amendments to the Rules of Business or that alter Nepra\u2019s legal status, independence, or quasi-judicial authority. The amendments are strictly administrative and do not interfere with Nepra\u2019s core regulatory mandate.\nNo. Wherever policy decisions or policy directions are involved, the term \u201cFederal Government\u201d has been consciously retained in the law. At no place do the proposed amendments authorise the Power Division to issue policy directions independently or bypass the Federal Cabinet. The scope of the changes is limited to procedural and technical matters only.\nThe Federal Cabinet has approved the draft set of proposed amendments. Following this, the draft legislation will undergo due legal vetting and finalisation. Once completed, the bill will be submitted to Parliament through the Parliamentary Affairs Division, in accordance with the prescribed legislative process.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

As a result, the debt in Discos decreased from Rs590 billion in 2024 to Rs397 billion in 2025, he added.\nHe also highlighted improvements in macroeconomic indicators \u2013 such as a stable exchange rate, lower KIBOR, and reduced inflation \u2013 as factors that contributed to lower tariffs and reduced markup charges on payables. These, in turn, played a key role in reducing the circular debt, he added. The minister also confirmed that K-Electric had resumed regular payments as part of the debt reduction plan.\nHe stated that the government has set a target to eliminate circular debt within the next six years, supported by parallel reforms aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the power sector. \u201cThis initiative is expected to lead to the removal of the Debt Servicing Surcharge, which currently stands at Rs3.23 per unit and is levied to cover the markup on circular debt payables,\u201d he added.\nAdditionally, he mentioned that the government plans to reconstitute the boards of Discos to further address inefficiencies within distribution companies.\nMoreover, he stated that the government has begun transitioning to a more competitive electricity market, moving away from the long-standing single-buyer model, where the state was the sole purchaser of electricity.\nThe new structure will operate through competitive bidding and market-based pricing under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contractual Market (CTBCM) framework, he added.\nDuring the question hour, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik assured the House that the domestic gas sector is receiving uninterrupted supply at optimal pressure, especially during peak cooking hours.\nHe added that Sui companies are ensuring daily gas availability from 5 am to 10 pm. Malik also informed the House that the addition of 12 LNG cargoes to the supply network had improved the availability of regasified LNG (RLNG), helping meet demand across all sectors. Additionally, a dedicated dashboard has been set up to address consumer complaints on a daily basis.\nParliamentary Secretary for Communications, Gul Asghar Khan, confirmed that all infrastructure projects carried out by the National Highway Authority (NHA) adhere to international standards.\nKhan explained that the design of highways includes a 10-year lifespan for pavements and 50 years for bridges and tunnels. He also stated that the feasibility study for the M-10 Motorway is near completion and that the project will be executed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The M-9 Karachi-Hyderabad expressway will remain unchanged.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released a damning report on the performance of the power sector in spite of several structural and policy level interventions that included renegotiating the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) contracts signed by previous administrations (though the 2014 contracts signed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remain effective to this day) that inordinately favoured the producers with the take-or-pay option envisaging capacity payments which, in turn, escalated as and when solar panels were encouraged as part of the government\u2019s efforts to shift towards renewables as part of reforms to withstand the climate change impacts.\nIn addition, Nepra noted that distribution companies continued to suffer from poor governance with transmission and distribution losses exceeding allowable limits, low bill recovery and load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial losses. Reference was also made to Debt Service Surcharge sourced to poor governance of the power sub-sectors that accounts for higher utility tariffs with industry lamenting the fact that cross subsidies have made the cost of energy as an input into their production process much higher than the regional average, which is the reason behind the decline in exports. Circular debt, the report further noted, has risen.\nThe report undermines Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s repeated appreciation of the power sector team that perhaps prompted the Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari to publicly reject the report maintaining that it is \u201cbased on incomplete and inaccurate data which has led to widespread misunderstandings\u2026circular debt has not increased, instead for the first time a significant reduction is recorded\u2026it (circular debt) declined from 2.4 trillion rupees to 1.6 trillion rupees.\u201d The government, he said, is embarked on a six-year programme to completely eliminate circular debt which includes cancellation of 8,000MW costly projects that saved the country USD 17 billion (a saving that is not realised because the project never got off the ground) and to exclude commercial losses-based load-shedding was incorrect.\nIt has been widely reported that the government has taken 1.25 trillion rupee loans from the commercial banking sector at rates below the amount parked in the Holding Company, given the decline in the discount rate from 22 percent in 2022 to 10.5 percent today. Borrowing at lower rates to retire previous loans incurred at higher rates is welcome though ignored is the fact that borrowing that reflects poor performance and is to be payable by the hapless consumers is hardly likely to provide a comfort level to the general public.\nREAD MORE:Weak DISCO performance added Rs397bn to circular debt in FY25: NEPRA report\nThe Power Minister lamented the fact that Nepra did not take into account the data provided by his Ministry \u2014 a claim that is baffling given that regulatory authorities, like Nepra and Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority), are set up to protect the consumers and not to synchronise their data with that released by the political government. Additionally, regulatory bodies safeguard public welfare and ensure quality product service while preventing fraud and anti-competitive practices.\nRegulatory authorities provide crucial benefits by safeguarding public welfare through consumer protection, ensuring product/service quality, promoting fair competition, preventing fraud/anti-competitive practices, and establishing clear frameworks for industries, leading to greater trust, market efficiency, innovation, and economic stability. It is therefore very concerning from a consumer perspective that the government has reportedly finalised amendments to the Nepra Act 1997 aimed at making Nepra subordinate to the Power Division \u2014 a report that has not been denied by the government to-date.\nTo conclude, regulatory bodies like Nepra perform a very critical function and must be allowed to continue to protect consumer interests. The incumbent government\u2019s muzzling of several entities tasked to provide a service to the general public through legislation must be abandoned in favour of a more open and participatory discharge of functions that can lay the foundation of a system capable of evolving into one where borrowing would no longer be required.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is reportedly working on three proposals to reduce the industrial electricity tariff to 9 cents per kWh by eliminating cross-subsidy \u2014 one of the key demands of export-oriented industries for years,Business Recorderhas learnt from reliable sources.\nThe National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) determined the tariffs for distribution companies (Discos) for CY 2026 on January 7, 2026, fixing the national average tariff at Rs 33.38 per kWh, compared to Rs 34.00 per kWh for FY 2025-26.\nFor industrial consumers, the B-2 ToU rate has been fixed at Rs 34.47/kWh, B-3 ToU at Rs 33.26/kWh, and B-4 ToU at Rs 33.04/kWh.\nThe government will notify revised tariffs after incorporating available subsidies in line with its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nLast month, the Power Division briefed the highest forum that industrial consumers are currently being charged a base variable rate of Rs 29.25 per unit against the Nepra-determined rate of Rs 23.88 per unit, effectively cross-subsidising domestic consumers by Rs 5.37 per unit.\nEliminating this cross-subsidy would require an additional budgetary allocation of Rs 160 billion per annum \u2014 Rs 131 billion for Discos and Rs 29 billion for K-Electric.\nExplaining the rationale, sources said the move would make Pakistani industry regionally competitive and encourage higher production and exports. More affordable and predictable electricity tariffs would promote higher capacity utilisation, formalisation of industrial activity, and reinvestment in existing facilities. The reform is also expected to improve power sector efficiency by reducing reliance on captive generation, strengthening grid demand, and promoting a transparent and equitable tariff structure \u2014 thereby supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation.\nBased on data from the past 50 years, the price elasticity of demand is estimated at 0.22 percent, meaning a Rs 1 per unit reduction in tariff results in additional consumption of 265 GWh. Accordingly, a Rs 5.37 per unit reduction is expected to increase industrial electricity consumption by at least 1,423 GWh. This incremental demand is projected to raise real GDP by Rs 360 billion and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 28.5 billion.\nThe overall fiscal impact of this proposal would be Rs 160 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.\nSources further noted that the power sector budget has been reduced from Rs 1,287 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs 893 billion in FY 2025-26 due to efficiency gains, and these savings should be utilised to enhance affordability and sustainability in the power sector.\nProposal 2\nAfter removal of cross-subsidy, the all-inclusive pre-tax industrial tariff would be Rs 31.34 per unit \u2014 comprising Rs 23.88 per unit variable charge, Rs 4.23 per unit fixed charge, and Rs 3.23 per unit DSS\u2014equivalent to around 11 cents per kWh (at an exchange rate of Rs 280). A further reduction of Rs 6.13 per unit would bring the final tariff down to 9 cents per kWh.\nThis would require an additional budgetary support of Rs 182 billion per annum \u2014Rs 150 billion for Discos and Rs 32 billion for K-Electric \u2014 through fiscalisation of power producers\u2019 debt, with the resulting generation cost relief ring-fenced for industrial consumers.\nIf approved, this proposal would restore industrial competitiveness, boost production and exports, and drive economic growth. Sources said reducing the final industrial tariff to 9 cents would significantly enhance the global competitiveness of Pakistan\u2019s export-oriented and energy-intensive sectors, encourage reinvestment and expansion, and reduce dependence on captive power generation. Fiscalising legacy power sector debt would separate past inefficiencies from current consumption decisions and strengthen confidence in the policy framework.\nA Rs 6.13 per unit tariff reduction is expected to increase industrial consumption by at least 1,624 GWh, raise real GDP by Rs 411 billion, and generate additional tax revenue of Rs 32.5 billion, with a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum.\nIf the first two proposals are approved, the industrial tariff would be fixed at Rs 25.21 per kWh (9 cents), requiring a total subsidy of Rs 342 billion. However, electricity consumption would increase by 3,047 GWh, real GDP would rise by Rs 771 billion, and additional tax revenue of Rs 61 billion would be generated.\nProposal 3\nThe third proposal relates to the inclusion of greenfield industries in the Grid Sustainability Package (GSP) 2025. The government has announced the GSP as a subsidy-neutral mechanism to unlock latent demand by offering electricity at the marginal cost of 8 cents per kWh for consumption above a defined baseline.\nWhile the IMF approved the GSP, it did not allow the discounted rate to apply to the entire consumption of greenfield industries. The Power Division has requested that discussions with the IMF be reopened to include greenfield industries in full, in order to ensure grid sustainability, enhance industrial competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth.\nThe Power Division believes that since the current tariff structure already ensures full recovery of fixed costs through base consumption, extending the GSP rate to the entire load of greenfield data centres, crypto-mining facilities, and copper and aluminium industries would not compromise cost recovery. IMF-approved safeguards \u2014 including a 25 percent cap on aggregate incremental consumption, semi-annual reviews, and a termination clause\u2014further mitigate fiscal and system-level risks.\nSources said these greenfield industries, particularly data centres and crypto-mining operations, have significant potential to absorb surplus power, improve system load factors, stabilise grid operations during low-demand periods, and strengthen the financial sustainability of the power sector.\nQuantitative analysis using macroeconomic indicators shows that each additional 1 GWh of electricity sales adds Rs 253 million to real GDP. Although aluminium smelting and copper refining are energy-intensive, they generate tradable output and strong local supply chains involving mining, logistics, and exports. While the economic productivity per unit of electricity is lower for data centres and crypto-mining, these sectors still contribute meaningfully to GDP growth and tax revenues.\nIf approved, this proposal would have a fiscal impact of Rs 182 billion per annum in terms of revenue foregone and required subsidies.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

In the prevailing interest-rate environment, such partial recovery is exerting significant pressure on cash flows, working capital, and the overall financial health of the industry.\nContinued non-recovery of actual costs is neither sustainable nor consistent with the principle of cost neutrality embedded in the regulatory framework.\nOCAC has emphasised that line fill is a regulatory and operational necessity, essential for ensuring uninterrupted and efficient supply of petroleum products through pipeline infrastructure.\nConsequently, the financing cost associated with line fill is legitimate, unavoidable, and directly attributable to regulatory operational compliance. Non-recognition of the KIBOR premium component; therefore, effectively results in partial disallowance of actual costs, which is not on merit and undermines fairness.\nIn this context, OCAC has submitted that Ogra-being the regulator and monitor of the oil industry\u2014has a critical role in ensuring that genuine and prudently incurred costs are fully recoverable.\nAligning the allowed financing rate with the actual borrowing cost incurred by OMCs, including the applicable premium over KIBOR, would restore cost neutrality, support industry viability, and help safeguard uninterrupted supply to the national economy.\nAfter explaining the issue, OCAC has requested Ogra to review and rationalise the existing recovery methodology for line fill financing cost and allow recovery at the actual financing rate incurred by OMCs. This measure would meaningfully reduce financial pressure on the industry.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: President of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), Muhammad Ikram Rajput, has called for the immediate abolition of cross-subsidy embedded in electricity tariffs for industries, stating that the additional cost ranging from Rs4.5 to Rs7 per unit is rendering industrial operations increasingly uncompetitive and financially unviable.\nHe said the industrial sector is already grappling with high production costs, weak demand, and mounting financial pressures. In such circumstances, the cross-subsidy amounting to nearly a 20 percent additional burden has made it difficult for many industrial units to sustain even routine operations.\nQuestioning the policy rationale, Rajput said that if, as claimed by the Ministry of Energy, performance in the power sector has improved, it is difficult to understand why a competitive electricity tariff of around 9 cents per unit for industry remains unattainable. \u201cIf the sector is indeed stabilised, why are the benefits not being passed directly on to industrial consumers?\u201d he asked.President KATI stressed that without affordable and competitive electricity, neither export growth nor sustainable job creation is possible. He warned that the Prime Minister\u2019s stated objective of boosting exports and ultimately exiting the IMF programme cannot be achieved as long as industry continues to bear the burden of policies unrelated to its actual consumption or performance.\nRajput also expressed concern over the design of the current three-year incremental consumption package. He noted that while the previous winter package offered broad-based relief to industry, the current scheme is restrictive, excluding several industrial units particularly those whose electricity consumption was higher between December 2023 and November 2024.\nHe further criticised the load factors imposed by the Power Division, stating that there is no clear technical or regulatory justification for applying such benchmarks in a concessional package intended to stimulate electricity demand.\nThese parameters, he said, appear to have been borrowed from anti-theft and detection billing mechanisms, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the package.\nInstead of encouraging additional consumption, the scheme risks merely shifting demand within the industrial sector.\nThe KATI president urged Federal Minister for Energy (Power Division) Sardar Awais Leghari to immediately remove cross-subsidy from industrial electricity bills and to undertake a comprehensive review of the incremental consumption package so that it genuinely supports increased industrial activity.\nHe said the future of industry, export competitiveness, and overall economic recovery is directly linked to fair, transparent, and rational electricity pricing.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "After years of stop-start recoveries, Large-Scale Manufacturing is now exhibiting momentum that is difficult to dismiss as episodic. November 2025 marked a decisive break from past patterns.\nYear-on-year growth of 10.37 percent was the strongest since June 2022, while the November index reading matched the highs last seen in November FY22.\nOn a cumulative basis, LSM growth for 5MFY26 stands at 6.01 percent year-on-year, with the index reading for the July to November period the highest ever recorded for this window.\nMore telling than the headline numbers is the breadth of the recovery. On a cumulative 5MFY26 basis, 16 industries are in positive territory, with only six contracting. For November alone, just four industries remained in the red, the lowest count of negative sectors since February 2022. This confirms that LSM growth is no longer being propped up by one or two outperformers, a recurring feature of earlier recoveries.\nSectoral dynamics underline this shift. Automobiles continue to anchor growth, but petroleum has emerged as the standout performer.\nOn a cumulative basis, petroleum contributed second most to overall LSM growth after automobiles, while in November alone it made the single largest contribution. Year-on-year growth of 44 percent in November reflects record-breaking production. Both petrol and high-speed diesel reached their highest-ever monthly output, pushing the petroleum index to its strongest level since May 2018.\nThe food sector is also gaining traction. The sugar season has commenced on a firmer footing compared to last year, providing an early boost to food LSM. With sugar carrying the second-highest weight in the food basket, sustained production between November and March could meaningfully lift cumulative food sector growth in the months ahead.\nAn unexpected boost in November came from the beverage sector, which despite its relatively low weight made a significant contribution to overall LSM growth. The beverage index for November 2025 was the highest ever recorded for the month, and by a wide margin, driven primarily by strong output of soft drinks and mineral water.\nTextiles remain under pressure, but this weakness is increasingly being offset by steady gains in readymade garment exports.\nWhile month-on-month fluctuations persist, year-on-year momentum remains intact, aided by a favorable base. Pharmaceuticals, by contrast, continue to underperform overall, though November did offer a bright spot.\nTablet production rebounded to a 40-month high, suggesting early signs of stabilization within a subdued sector.\nTransport-related manufacturing continues to reinforce the expansion. Motorcycle and bicycle sales reached 4-year and 6-year monthly highs, respectively, in November, aligning with broader strength across the automobile value chain. These trends are feeding directly into LSM readings and strengthening the case for durability.\nMacro conditions are now turning supportive rather than merely less restrictive. The interest rate cycle has begun to ease, energy prices are materially lower than both one year and two years ago, and incentives on incremental electricity consumption remain in place.\nTogether, these factors are translating into improved capacity utilization and sustained output gains. LSM growth is increasingly resembling a trend rather than a short-lived rebound.\nThat said, perspective remains necessary. FY22 continues to serve as the benchmark, and it remains out of reach for FY26. To match those highs, LSM growth would need to average close to 15 percent over the remaining seven months, an outcome that appears unlikely.\nEven so, the current trajectory suggests that LSM has decisively turned a corner. The damage inflicted over the past few years has been deep, but the recovery is now broader, more balanced, and materially more credible than at any point since mid-2022.",

      "fullText": "LAHORE: FPCCI leader and Patron-in-Chief UBG S M Tanveer has expressed serious concerns over the continued use of industrial electricity tariffs as a tool for cross subsidy, warning that this approach is steadily eroding Pakistan\u2019s industrial competitiveness and export capacity.\nHe stated that industrial tariffs are currently carrying a cross subsidy burden ranging from Rs 4.5 to Rs 7 per unit, with a total impact of Rs 131 billion, which translates into an additional cost of nearly 20 percent on already expensive electricity. According to him, industry is barely managing to carry its own burden, and this extra cost is pushing many units towards closure or long term contraction.\nS M Tanveer pointed out that over the past few years, the number of protected consumers has almost doubled, yet instead of supporting these consumers through fiscal space, the government has chosen the easier route of loading this burden onto industry. He said this policy effectively uses industry as a balancing item for systemic failures, even though industry is the only segment that consistently pays, consumes, and creates employment.\nHe strongly urged the government and the Minister for Energy Power Division to immediately remove cross subsidy from industrial electricity tariffs and to stop using industry as a substitute for fiscal reform.

      "fullText": "LAHORE: Pakistan can still achieve its ambitious tax collection targets if the government takes decisive action against illicit trade. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faced a significant shortfall of Rs545 billion against its original target during the first half of the current fiscal year. This gap reflects massive revenue leakage in the economy, sources said.\nAccording to a study by Ipsos on tax evasion in five sectors, over Rs1 trillion is lost annually to tax evasion and smuggling across key sectors. A strategic focus on enforcement and documentation could provide the fiscal space needed to stabilize the economy without further burdening compliant taxpayers or the formal business community.\nThe \u201cshadow economy\u201d has become the primary hurdle for economic recovery. The real estate sector alone accounts for approximately Rs500 billion in annual tax losses, while illicit tobacco trade\u2014comprising smuggled and non-tax-paid cigarettes costs the national exchequer another Rs310 billion. Other major industries, including tyres, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, and tea, collectively account for over Rs200 billion in additional evasion, the sources said.\nMacroeconomic analyst Osama Siddiqui said because these sectors operate largely outside the documented net, fiscal pressure is unfairly shifted onto a small pool of compliant taxpayers. This creates a vicious cycle where high taxes further incentivize evasion and hinder commercial growth.\nREAD MORE:FBR\u2019s \u2018revolution\u2019: future of Pakistan\u2019s economic sovereignty\nSiddiqui said that the solution lies in targeted enforcement rather than higher tax rates. \u201cTo meet these tax targets, the government must plug loopholes that lead to tax leakages and intensify targeted enforcement efforts,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe state should focus on bringing the undocumented sector into the tax net and eliminating smuggling rather than solely relying on existing resources. The ineffective implementation of Track & Trace systems across various industries highlights a lack of government resolve in curbing illicit trade.\u201d\nHe urged that the path to fiscal sustainability depends on shifting strategy from taxing the \u201calready taxed\u201d to capturing the \u201cuntaxed\u201d. Strengthening regulatory enforcement and eliminating illicit trade networks are essential steps to ensure tax targets are met through growth and equity rather than emergency measures, he said.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

Sankarasubramanian, chairman of the Fertiliser Association of India, an industry body representing fertiliser producers. \u201cMaize production has also pushed up urea consumption.\u201d\nUrea imports are expected to rise as much as 61% from a year earlier to 9 million metric tons, while DAP imports could jump 52% to 7 million tons, Sankarasubramanian said.\nIndia imports urea and DAP mainly from Oman, Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and Morocco.",

      "fullText": "Pakistan\u2019s national grid power generation in 1HFY26 remained 10 percent below the peak observed in 1HFY22. At 65 billion kilowatt hours, output was still lower than the same period in 2020, and only marginally higher than levels recorded in 2018 and 2019.\nDecember, however, stood out from the broader trend. It marked only the third instance in the past 18 months where actual generation exceeded reference generation.\nOn a year-on-year basis, December generation was up 9 percent, the strongest growth recorded so far in FY26. This improvement coincided with the introduction of the winter consumption incentive package, which became effective from December and appears to have played a meaningful role in lifting demand.\nThis is in addition to the ongoing reintegration of previously captive industrial consumers into the grid, which has resulted in industrial demand from the grid rising by as much as 35 percent year on year.\nDespite these tailwinds, cumulative generation in 1HFY26 improved by barely 1 percent compared to last year, implying a pronounced contraction in other demand segments, particularly domestic and agricultural consumption.\nWhile aggregate generation exceeded reference levels, the composition of supply presents a more instructive picture. Seasonal weakness in hydel output shifted the burden towards imported fuels.\nRLNG based generation was around 25 percent higher than planned, while imported coal recorded the most significant deviation. Actual coal-based generation rose to 860 million units against a reference of 422 million units. This reliance on costlier imported fuels largely explains the upward pressure seen in monthly fuel charge adjustments.\nDemand patterns are also reshaping operational dynamics. Evening demand spikes following sunset are becoming more pronounced, increasing reliance on RLNG and coal fired plants to meet short term load requirements. These plants are increasingly central to managing ramp up needs as the system adjusts to changing consumption behavior.\nWith the incremental consumption relief package for industry and agriculture now in place, the trajectory of grid demand will hinge to the extent to which these incentives translate into sustained usage.\nWhile industrial feedback has so far been sharply critical, this response may be overstated. With a substantial number of captive users already shifted back to the grid and incremental consumption priced at a meaningful discount, industrial demand should continue to strengthen, assuming no adverse policy or pricing shocks.",

      "fullText": "Pakistan\u2019s rooftop solar revolution has delivered cleaner power at record speed, but without urgent policy resets, it risks destabilising the very grid it depends on. The scale and speed of adoption have exposed structural faults in a system designed for one-way power flows from large, centralized generators. While policy responses are now emerging, failure to align incentives with system realities could still trade short-term gains for long-term grid fragmentation and inequity.\nThe numbers are eye-opening. With over 50 GW of solar panels imported into Pakistan in just five years, the country has witnessed one of the fastest market-driven clean energy transitions in the region. This surge has dramatically reshaped daytime electricity demand while leaving evening peaks largely unchanged, creating the classic \u201cduck curve\u201d that forces utilities to maintain costly standby capacity.\nAt the same time, a rapid influx of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is emerging alongside rooftop solar installations. Industrial and commercial consumers, in particular, are increasingly deploying BESS to manage load-shedding, avoid peak tariffs, and insulate operations from grid volatility.\nWhile this shift can improve reliability and flatten demand peaks, its system-wide impacts on load forecasting, tariff recovery, grid operations, safety standards, and end-of-life management have yet to be fully assessed or reflected in regulation.\nYet the financing behind this transformation remains largely opaque. The solar-and-storage boom is being driven primarily by households and firms with access to upfront capital, while lower-income consumers remain effectively locked out of the transition. As a result, the benefits of reduced bills, energy autonomy, and resilience accrue disproportionately to better-capitalized users, even as the fixed costs of maintaining the grid are increasingly borne by consumers with no access to distributed generation.\nThe release of draft revisions to the NEPRA (Prosumer) Regulations, 2025 reflects an emerging regulatory consensus that Pakistan\u2019s rooftop solar expansion is beginning to strain grid operations and cost recovery. The regulations codify a shift from net metering to net billing, replacing retail-rate compensation with credits based on the national average energy purchase price. This change recognizes that exported rooftop electricity has a system value distinct from retail consumption and must be priced accordingly.\nThat change in demand has material consequences for the financing of the power system. Transmission and distribution networks, capacity charges, and system-balancing services represent largely fixed or lumpy costs; they do not shrink in proportion to the kilowatt-hours an individual household consumes.\nWhen affluent consumers install rooftop PV and export surplus during daylight hours, they reduce their bills but continue to rely on the same wires, substations, and balancing services every evening. The residual cost must therefore be recovered from a shrinking pool of consumers, many of whom cannot afford distributed generation.\nThe new prosumer regulations partially address this imbalance by delinking export compensation from retail tariffs. However, they stop short of introducing explicit grid-access or capacity charges. As a result, fixed network costs remain socialized across non-solar consumers, leaving unresolved the equity concerns that accompany rapid rooftop adoption.\nREAD MORE:Pakistan\u2019s solar rush unlocked $17-19bn in private investment in 8 years: study\nRecognizing technical constraints, the regulations also empower distribution companies to refuse new connections where distributed generation capacity reaches 80% of a transformer\u2019s rated capacity, and to require load-flow studies for larger installations. These safeguards implicitly validate the concern that unmanaged rooftop growth can overload local networks, reinforcing the need for planning tools that anticipate not react to distributed generation impacts.\nThe revised framework reflects a broader fiscal reality. Pakistan\u2019s power sector continues to carry legacy liabilities and circular debt, and the federal government has recently relied on substantial financing packages to stabilize sector finances. In this context, policies that further erode distribution company revenues without addressing cost recovery risk deepening fiscal stress and political backlash.\nNone of this should be read as an argument against rooftop solar. Distributed PV reduces fuel imports, cuts emissions, and improves resilience. The challenge is no longer whether rooftop solar should grow, but how it should be integrated so that private benefits do not undermine collective infrastructure.\nTo that end, three pragmatic policy directions remain essential.\nFirst, remuneration must be aligned with system value through the continued rollout of net billing combined with time-of-use tariffs. Net billing alone reduces regressive cross-subsidies, but without temporal price signals it cannot address the mismatch between daytime exports and evening demand.\nSecond, transparent and modest grid-access or capacity charges should be introduced to ensure all connected users contribute fairly to fixed network costs. Such charges should be carefully designed, with exemptions or lifeline thresholds for low-income consumers, to avoid undermining energy access while preventing cost shifting from large exporters to vulnerable households.\nThird, incentives must pivot toward storage and demand-side management. Battery prices have fallen sharply, yet the current regulatory framework remains silent on encouraging hybrid solar-plus-storage systems or compensating prosumers for providing grid services. Without these incentives, the duck curve will persist, merely flattened rather than resolved.\nThe regulations provide procedural clarity through defined timelines and renewable five-year agreements, but the ability to revise export rates during the agreement term introduces uncertainty for investors. Predictable transition pathways rather than discretionary revisions will be critical to channeling investment toward grid-friendly technologies such as storage, smart inverters, and managed electric-vehicle charging.\nThese reforms are not unprecedented. Mature markets in Europe and North America have moved away from flat retail net metering toward net billing, dynamic tariffs, and grid-usage fees while preserving strong solar uptake. Citizen empowerment was not extinguished; it was redirected into models that are technically sound and economically sustainable.\nFor distribution companies, the imperative is to engage constructively with regulators and consumers to implement reforms that are evidence-based, transparent, and phased. Sudden reversals or opaque policymaking invite uncertainty and backlash; predictable transitions mobilize investment in storage, smart meters, and grid-edge services that benefit all users.\nFor consumers, the message remains straightforward: rooftop solar is a public good, but it is also part of a shared system. Individual energy independence should not erode the collective infrastructure that guarantees supply for everyone.\nOne critical issue still waiting in the wings is the end-of-life management of solar panels. With an average lifespan of 25-30 years, today\u2019s installations will become tomorrow\u2019s waste stream. The absence of any provision for environmentally sound disposal, recycling, or extended producer responsibility in the current regulatory framework risks replacing fuel imports with unmanaged solar waste undermining the sustainability narrative that solar power promises.\nPakistan\u2019s new prosumer regulations mark a necessary evolution from unpriced exports toward system-aware compensation. But regulation alone is not reform. Without complementary measures on storage, grid-access pricing, demand management, and lifecycle responsibility, the country risks solving yesterday\u2019s tariff problem while sowing tomorrow\u2019s technical, fiscal, and environmental challenges.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026\nAsad Mahmood\nThe writer has served at the Energy Conservation Fund, NEECA.

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Writ petitions filed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) against the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for an inquiry into \u201cillegal tax refunds\u201d issued by the officers of LTO Lahore, have been disposed of by the Lahore High Court (LHC) and settled inter-departmental accountability and taxpayer confidentiality.\nJustice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, firmly declined to exercise constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199, holding that disputes between attached departments of the Federal Government must first resolve through the consultative mechanism prescribed under Rule 8(2) of the Rules of Business, 1973, ultimately falling within the domain of the Prime Minister.Notably, the LHC emphasised that the dispute between FBR (Revenue Division) and FIA (Interior Division) is a classic inter-divisional conflict, constitutionally required to be resolved through ministerial consultation and, if needed, submission to the Prime Minister or Cabinet. Judicial intervention, the Court warned, should not convert into the \u201cFederation litigating against itself.\u201d\nThe case stemmed from Enquiry No E-77/2024, in which FIA officials issued multiple notices under the FIA Act, CrPC and AMLA, demanding production of five years\u2019 confidential income and sales tax refund records of LTO Lahore. Despite repeated objections by FBR citing section 216 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, the FIA went a step further and raided LTO Lahore on 23.07.2024, forcibly seizing records under a magistrate-issued search warrant.\nWhile declining relief on procedural grounds, the LHJC made several critical observations that FIA Act does not enjoy overriding supremacy over fiscal statutes, unlike NAB laws.\nProtection remains applicable unless offences under FIA\u2019s own statutory mandate are clearly made out. Fishing expeditions into taxpayer data violate the legislative scheme of tax administration, it added.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

As a key milestone, Maersk \u2014 the largest shipping line operating in Pakistan and handling nearly 26 percent of the country\u2019s total cargo \u2014 earlier began applying official bank exchange rates, setting a benchmark for the rest of the industry.\nWritten confirmations of compliance have been received from major international shipping lines and their local agents, including Hapag-Lloyd, Ocean Network Express (ONE), COSCO Shipping, CMA CGM, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), OOCL, and United Marine Agencies, among others, establishing full industry-wide adherence to SBP-compliant exchange rates.\nFor several years, traders and exporters had raised serious concerns regarding the arbitrary application of inflated dollar exchange rates by shipping lines, often far exceeding SBP-notified rates. This practice significantly increased the cost of doing business, adversely impacted export competitiveness, and created uncertainty in shipping charges.\nThe initiative is expected to substantially reduce cost pressures on traders and exporters, improve transparency and predictability in shipping charges, and restore confidence within the business community.\nThis achievement underscores FBR\u2019s firm commitment to safeguarding legitimate trade, promoting ease of doing business, and supporting Pakistan\u2019s export-led economic growth through effective regulatory oversight and stakeholder engagement.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "TAHIR AMINISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered Pakistan\u2019s economic growth outlook, cutting its GDP projection for the current fiscal year to 3.2 percent, down from 3.6 percent estimated in its October 2025 World Economic Outlook.The Fund in its latest report \u201cWorld Economic Outlook 2026 update, global economy: steady amid divergent forces\u201d, estimated Pakistan\u2019 GDP growth at three percent in 2025, which is projected to grow to 3.2 percent in the outgoing fiscal year 2026 and 4.1 percent in 2027.World Bank has projected Pakistan GDP growth to remain at three percent in fiscal year 2025\u201326 before rising to 3.4 percent in fiscal year 2026\u201327.The National Accounts Committee (NAC) has approved the updated growth of GDP during fiscal year 2024-25 at 3.09 percent. The Committee further estimated that economy has posted a growth of 3.71 percent during first quarter (Q1) of fiscal year 2025-26.The Fund stated that global growth is projected to remain resilient at 3.3 percent in 2026 and at 3.2 percent in 2027: rates similar to the estimated 3.3 percent outturn in 2025. The forecast marks a small upward revision for 2026 and no change for 2027 compared with that in the October 2025 WEO. This steady performance on the surface results from the balancing of divergent forces. Headwinds from shifting trade policies are offset by tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), more so in North America and Asia than in other regions, as well as fiscal and monetary support, broadly accommodative financial conditions, and adaptability of the private sector.Global headline inflation is expected to decline from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2025 to 3.8 percent in 2026 and further to 3.4 percent in 2027. The inflation projections are also broadly unchanged from those in October and envisage inflation returning to target more gradually in the United States than in other large economies.Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. Re-evaluation of productivity growth expectations about AI could lead to a decline in investment and trigger an abrupt financial market correction, spreading from AI-linked companies to other segments and eroding household wealth. Trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity. Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices. Larger fiscal deficits and high public debt could put pressure on long-term interest rates and, in turn, on broader financial conditions. On the upside, activity could be further lifted by AI-related investment and eventually transform into sustainable growth if faster AI adoption translates into strong productivity gains and increased business dynamism. Activity could also be supported by a sustained easing in trade tensions. Policies to foster stability and sustainably lift medium-term growth prospects require a keen focus on restoring fiscal buffers, preserving price and financial stability, reducing uncertainty, and implementing structural reforms without further delay.",

      "fullText": "DAVOS: Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, has underscored the importance of fiscal discipline, productive use of debt and export-led growth as key pathways to unlocking new sources of economic growth, while speaking at a high-level panel discussion on \u201cHow Can We Unlock New Sources of Growth? \u2013 Weight of Global Debt\u201d held on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nPresenting an emerging markets perspective, Senator Aurangzeb emphasized that debt, in itself, is not inherently negative, provided it is deployed productively.\nHe noted that for countries like Pakistan, debt must be directed toward investments that generate exportable surplus rather than consumption, enabling sustainable repayment and long-term growth.\nREAD MORE:Finance minister discusses investment, economic outlook with Saudi counterpart at WEF\nHe highlighted that emerging economies do not have privilege of reserve currencies and therefore must ensure market efficiency, prudent borrowing and careful management of foreign exchange risks.\nThe minister stressed that unsustainable debt trajectories are fundamentally a consequence of weak fiscal discipline. He shared that Pakistan has made significant progress by reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from 75 percent to 70 percent, achieving a primary surplus and restoring fiscal balance through responsible economic management.\nHe added that inflation in Pakistan has declined sharply from a peak of 38 percent to single digits, while the policy rate has been reduced from over 22 percent to 10.5 percent, placing the country on the favourable side of the interest rate cycle.\nSenator Aurangzeb highlighted ongoing debt management reforms, including liability management operations, debt buybacks and efforts to create value in domestic markets.\nHe also announced that Pakistan is set to enter the Chinese capital market with its inaugural Panda bond, structured as a green bond, reflecting the country\u2019s commitment to sustainable and climate-resilient financing.\nAddressing the issue of climate change, the Minister stated that for Pakistan and other vulnerable emerging economies, climate risks are real, recurring and economically disruptive.\nHe noted that building fiscal buffers has enabled Pakistan to respond to recent floods through domestic resources rather than international emergency appeals, underscoring the importance of fiscal resilience in the face of exogenous shocks.\nHe further highlighted the role of public-private partnerships and capital markets in financing adaptation and development projects, citing the successful closure of Pakistan\u2019s largest-ever syndicated financing of approximately USD 3.6 billion for a major copper mining project.\nThe project, he noted, is expected to generate around USD 2.8 billion in exports annually from 2028, significantly strengthening Pakistan\u2019s export base and supporting global energy transition needs.\nResponding to a question from the audience on technology funding and the new economy, Senator Aurangzeb emphasized Pakistan\u2019s strong potential in IT, freelancing and digital services, noting recent growth in IT exports and ongoing investments in skills development, blockchain and emerging technologies.\nHe reiterated that access to funding is not the core challenge; rather, capacity building, prioritization and effective execution are critical to translating opportunities into sustainable growth.\nConcluding his remarks, the Minister stated that responsible fiscal management, strategic use of debt, investment in the new economy and climate resilience are central to Pakistan\u2019s growth strategy, adding that \u201cit is not about the availability of debt or funding, but how wisely and effectively it is steered to create long-term economic value.\u201d\nThe panel discussion was hosted and moderated by Joumanna Bercetche, Anchor, Bloomberg News, and featured leading global financial and investment figures, including Anne Walsh, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Guggenheim Partners; Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of State Street; and Jennifer Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of Franklin Templeton.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: For years, the accepted wisdom in Pakistan\u2019s economic policymaking circles has treated the country\u2019s fiscal distress as a problem that primarily begins and ends with low tax collection.\nA fresh analysis cited by former caretaker commerce minister Gohar Ejaz, however, underscores a harder truth economists have long flagged: ballooning government expenditure has repeatedly outpaced revenue gains, reducing higher taxes into little more than a stopgap while debt continues to mount. Pakistan\u2019s challenge, at its core, then is an expenditure crisis, one where runaway state spending, and not just taxpayer failure, is pushing public debt to unsustainable levels and exposing the limits of the government\u2019s current economic playbook.\nRecently-released data by the Economic Policy and Business Development think tank that Ejaz chairs decisively dismantles the notion that the country\u2019s fiscal troubles stem from inadequate taxation. Between FY15 and FY25, tax revenue expanded by an extraordinary 302 percent, from Rs 2.91 trillion to Rs 11.7 trillion. This was an outcome driven by successive tax hikes, the withdrawal of exemptions and a regressive tax regime that repeatedly targets the same narrow, documented segments of the economy while leaving large swathes undertaxed. Yet even allowing for persistent under-taxation and the dominance of undocumented economic activity \u2014 problems that unquestionably require urgent correction \u2014 the public debt trajectory over the same decade makes it blatantly clear that our fiscal crisis has been fuelled far more by the scale and structure of government spending, with public debt rising by a staggering 365 percent from Rs 17.3 trillion to Rs 80.5 trillion, inflating debt servicing costs and decisively outpacing revenue growth.\nREAD MORE:Govt debt stocks slump Rs345bn in 5 months\nThese figures expose a disturbing distortion at the heart of Pakistan\u2019s public finances that sees each extra rupee extracted in taxes matched by Rs 7.2 in new borrowing. In absolute terms, this amounts to tax receipts rising by Rs 8.79 trillion, while total debt soared by Rs 63.2 trillion. Furthermore, this imbalance has only hardened in recent times. Over the past three years, domestic debt servicing has emerged as the single largest source of expenditure growth, steadily squeezing development spending and choking off productive investment \u2014 precisely the kind of spending needed to arrest the debt spiral.\nDebt accumulation, in itself, need not be destabilising if it is deployed strategically and is used to finance growth-enhancing infrastructure, build human capital, or expand the economy\u2019s productive capacity in ways that generate future returns. In Pakistan, however, an increasing share of borrowing is being consumed simply to service past liabilities. And what little room remains is further devoured by other non-development expenditures: government departments routinely overshooting their budgets, an entrenched reluctance to rein in lavish state spending, a pensions bill that continues to expand, and a governance framework that structurally encourages higher spending: civil administration remains overstaffed and poorly streamlined, and ministries that should have been devolved to the provinces under the 18th Amendment continue to function at the federal level, entrenching inefficiency and inflating government spending. Austerity drives are announced with much fanfare, but rarely have they been matched by the political will required to cut wasteful spending or enforce meaningful fiscal discipline, ensuring that adjustment remains cosmetic while the underlying fiscal rot deepens.\nThe fact of the matter is that continued reliance on higher taxes, without reining in public spending will only further shrink the formal sector, weaken export competitiveness, and deter both domestic and foreign investment. The reality is clear: sustainable economic recovery depends on sharply reducing borrowing and dismantling the entrenched culture of profligacy within government. Breaking the seemingly endless cycle of borrowing, debt servicing and revenue shortfalls is essential to restore long-term fiscal stability, and the government must realise that meaningful austerity that enforces genuine spending discipline and reforms inefficiencies is the only viable path forward.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

      "fullText": "EDITORIAL: Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal announced the imposition of an \u201cExport Emergency\u201d in the country entailing the creation of a special cell in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to address problems and constraints facing the business community on an urgent basis with the objective of increasing exports by 40 percent in four years and 200 percent by 2035.\nHis statement reflects an awareness of a decline in exports leading to a rise in the trade deficit during the first half of the current year against the same period the year before \u2014 negative USD 19,204 million as opposed to negative USD 14,271 million \u2014 which implies that the reliance on foreign borrowing, including rollovers from friendly countries, borrowing from bilaterals and multilaterals, to shore up foreign exchange reserves continues unabated.\nAwareness of a problem is the first step towards its resolution and requires sector experts/stakeholders to delve into the causes of the problem and formulate a set of remedial measures designed to resolve it in the short, medium and ideally long term.\nThere is a plethora of empirical research gathering dust in government offices that highlights the reasons behind Pakistan\u2019s cyclical economic volatility.\nThe October 2024 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report titled Request for an Extended Fund Arrangement reiterated the crux of the problem notably \u201ceconomic volatility has only increased over time, with a tight correlation between Pakistan\u2019s boom-bust economic outcomes and its macroeconomic policies.\u201d The report, disturbingly, added that \u201ccompared to nine other regional peers, the country\u2019s export growth since 2000 has been second to last, with sales to the world particularly stagnant during the 2010s.\nREAD MORE:BR RESEARCH: Pakistan\u2019s export performance: the emergency reflex\nThe country\u2019s trade restrictions (including exchange measures, tariff and non-tariff barriers, restrictions to payments, etc.) have placed it consistently at or around the 90th percentile of the highest Measurement of Aggregate Trade Restrictions index\u2026. This high level of protection has not helped improve, and likely undermined, Pakistan\u2019s competitiveness.\u201d One can only hope that the export emergency cell would take cognizance of these observations and not repeat past mistakes which have been to extend monetary and fiscal subsidies to specific influential sectors with the objective of increasing exports, which would reactivate the boom-bust syndrome.\nWhile setting up an export emergency cell in the PM Office indicates that that the government has elevated it at the highest executive level, thereby facilitating appropriate policy decisions promptly, there is a need to carefully review the pledges made by the economic team leaders to the Fund \u2014 pledges that if not met may not only lead to a cessation of the next tranche release but as has been evident since 2019 may lead to the three friendly countries refusing to roll over 12 billion dollars to another year.\nThe Fund\u2019s advice is implicit in its observation: \u201cwith an export basket strongly biased towards agriculture and textiles, the country has struggled to reallocate resources towards more technologically complex products. Reallocation, however, is held back by existing microeconomic distortions, including public procurement of agricultural goods, price controls on raw inputs, and fiscal and financial incentives for low productivity sectors.\u201d In other words, structural reforms are required that do not consist of monetary or fiscal incentives or setting up special economic zones, that the government has pledged to phase out and not announce any new ones but to end all existing economic distortions.\nIf past precedence is anything to go by an \u2018export emergency cell\u2019 will undertake measures that would bring it in conflict with pledges made to the IMF. To increase our leverage with the Fund would require taking measures that would be supported by the Fund and include ending the energy cross-subsidy paid for by industry, reducing current expenditure to create fiscal space that would ease the vise-like application of the Federal Board of Revenue\u2019s audit function being described as harassment by industry, end red tape implicit in any new venture and end the elite capture of both budgeted resources as well as outlay.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2026",

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.5 percent in November.\nThe greenback recovered versus the euro on Wednesday on Trump\u2019s remarks about Greenland, after losing a bit less than 1 percent between Monday and Tuesday. It was last down 0.35 percent to USD1.1726 per euro, following a 0.35 percent rebound in the prior session. The dollar weakened 0.52 percent to 0.7913 Swiss francs.\nThe Australian dollar rose to a 15-month high, buoyed by data showing an unexpected decline in the jobless rate. The yen remained under pressure after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi this week called a snap election and pledged measures to loosen fiscal policy.\nTrump\u2019s threat to levy tariffs on allied nations resisting his ambition to control Greenland had spooked markets, triggering a broad selloff of US assets. Still, some analysts said there was little evidence of a real move out of the US dollar.\n\u201cThis whole argument about European investors selling US assets is very hard to sustain,\u201d said Bob Savage, head market strategist at BNY.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a \u2018sell America\u2019 story, it\u2019s a risk-management story,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re just seeing more hedging because volatility has risen after being at very low levels at the end of last year.\u201d\nDetails of a framework for an agreement on Greenland were not yet known. However, \u201cthe most likely outcome is still that the next wave of excitement will pass us by after a brief period of volatility and that the market will refocus on central banks and interest rate differentials,\u201d Savage said.\nThe Aussie was last up 0.83 percent to USD0.6818, touching its strongest level since October 2024, and headed for a fourth straight daily gain, outperforming even as risk assets came under pressure this week.\n\u201cThe strength of both the Australian and the New Zealand dollar is the latest example that speculation about moves in short-term interest rates in relation to central bank policy remains alive and well,\u201d said Jane Foley, senior forex strategist at Rabobank.\nThe Japanese currency weakened 0.07 percent at 158.415 per US dollar, near last week\u2019s 18-month trough of 159.45.\nMarkets.Energy\nOil prices slide\nREUTERS\nNEW YORK: Oil prices slid about 2 percent on Thursday after US President Donald Trump softened threats against Greenland and Iran, and as investors assessed the supply-demand outlook.\nBrent futures fell USD1.01, or 1.6percent, to USD64.23 a barrel at 11:26 a.m. EDT (1626 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 96 cents, or 1.6percent, to USD59.66 a barrel, headed for its lowest close since January 15.\nTrump said he had secured total and permanent US access to Greenland in a deal with NATO, whose head said allies would have to step up their commitment to Arctic security to ward off threats from Russia and China.\nTrump also backed off tariff threats and ruled out taking Greenland by force, moderating a stance that had caused a rupture in transatlantic ties. \u201cThere is a deflation of risk premium related to the Greenland debacle and Iran supply risk has also been reduced,\u201d said Ole Hansen, chief commodity analyst at Saxo Bank.\nTrump said he hoped there would be no further US military action in Iran, but added the US would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear programme.\nIran, operating under sanctions, is the third biggest crude producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) organization behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. With less tension around Greenland and Iran, oil prices should hold at around USD60 a barrel, said Tony Sycamore, an analyst with online broker IG.\nTrump called for an end to the war in Ukraine, and reported \u201cgood\u201d talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Davos. US and Ukrainian officials have spent weeks in shuttle diplomacy. Trump has pressured Kyiv to secure peace after nearly four years of war, despite few signs Moscow wants to stop fighting. A deal to bring peace to Ukraine and lift sanctions on Russia, the world\u2019s third-biggest crude producer, could reduce oil prices by making more fuel available on global markets.\nThe French navy intercepted a Russian tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of being part of a shadow fleet that enables Russia to export oil despite sanctions.\nRussian oil output fell 0.8percent to 10.28 million barrels per day (bpd) last year, around a tenth of global production, according to data published on Thursday.",

This charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers. The regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025. It appreciated the government\u2019s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs.

These inefficie\u00adncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con\u00adtribute to the circular debt problem.\nIt said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. \u201cPersistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector\u2019s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth\u201d, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector\u2019s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.\nThe regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25.

The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.\nA notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.\nThe regulator put on record that \u201cKE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction.

      "fullText": "NEPRA\u2019S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.\nIn fact, the power sector\u2019s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector\u2019s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector\u2019s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator\u2019s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.\nThis resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.\nThe minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.\nHe said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.\nMr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps \u2014 both low recoveries and high losses \u2014 were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers\u2019 money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.\nThe minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.\nHe said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.\nHe agreed with the Nepra\u2019s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under \u2018take or pay\u2019 or \u2018must run\u2019 agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.\n\u2018Without due diligence\u2019\nResponding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.\n\u201cWe have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan\u2019s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,\u201d he said.\nThe minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.\nHe also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. \u201cIn the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,\u201d he said.\nHe also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was \u2018a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos\u2019. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.\nHe said the Discos\u2019 recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.\nCircular debt\nContesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator\u2019s \u201cunderstanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising\u201d.\nHe said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.\nMost importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. \u201cK-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric\u2019s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.\nThe receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,\u201d the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.\nResponding to Nepra\u2019s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday announced that the Rs3.23 per unit debt surcharge on electricity consumers would continue for up to six years as it notified a revised uniform national base tariff for the current year without any change.\nIn a statement issued on the sidelines of the revised tariff notification for all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, the Power Division said the debt surcharge, currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit, would be withdrawn in five to six years once the circular debt is cleared.\n\u201cOnce the circular debt is cleared, the debt surcharge currently charged at Rs3.23 per unit will be withdrawn, providing further tariff relief to consumers,\u201d it said, adding that the government had introduced a surplus power package under which industrial and agricultural consumers can avail additional electricity at a concessional rate of Rs22.98 per unit for three years, helping reduce average industrial tariffs.\nIn addition, a circular debt settlement plan has been launched to eliminate outstanding debt within five to six years.\nThe Power Division also conceded that the growth of off-grid solar consumption had distorted subsidy requirements, with the number of protected consumers doubling from 11 million in 2021 to 22m recently due to hybrid consumption patterns.\n\u201cThis has not only strained fiscal resources but has also increased the cross-subsidy burden on industrial and commercial users, undermining their competitiveness,\u201d it said, adding that commercial, bulk supply and high-consuming domestic consumers were currently bearing a significantly higher cross-subsidy burden than the industrial sector.\nResponding to criticism over higher energy costs \u2014 alsohighlightedby Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as one of the key reasons for the exit of foreign firms from Pakistan and export challenges \u2014 the Power Division said it would explore additional options to further reduce the cross-subsidy burden on industrial consumers, including subsidy reforms and debt refinancing, in addition to the tariff reduction measures already in place.\nIt added that data showed the industrial cross-subsidy burden had been reduced from Rs225 billion (Rs8.9 per unit) in March 2024, when the current government assumed office, to Rs102bn (Rs4.02 per unit) at present, reflecting a reduction of Rs123bn.\n\u201cIndustrial electricity tariffs (including taxes) have declined from Rs62.99 per unit in March 2024 to Rs46.31 per unit in December 2025, while the national average tariff has fallen from Rs53.04 to Rs42.27 per unit,\u201d it said.\nMoreover, to reduce electricity tariffs, the government has terminated inefficient power plants and successfully renegotiated contracts with independent power producers (IPPs). These measures have resulted in tariff reductions, and further negotiations with the remaining IPPs are underway, the Power Division said.\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

      "fullText": "For nearly two decades, Pakistan\u2019s exports have remained stuck between $25\u201330 billion, despite repeated declarations that export-led growth is central to economic revival. Over the same period, Bangladesh has crossed $50bn, while Vietnam now exceeds $350bn. This widening gap is not the result of global shocks or bad luck. It reflects domestic policy choices that have made exporting costly, uncertain, and unrewarding \u2014 while protecting inefficiency at home.\nMacroeconomic instability as a built-in disadvantage\nSuccessful exporters require stable costs and predictable policy. Pakistan offers neither. Recurrent balance-of-payments crises trigger abrupt stabilisation programmes, policy reversals, and stop-start incentives.\nExchange-rate management has been particularly damaging. Periodic overvaluation to contain inflation acts as a hidden tax on exports, eroding competitiveness. When corrections eventually occur, they are sharp and disruptive, driving up input costs and debt servicing. Exporters are forced to operate in an environment where profitability can disappear overnight.\nExporters taxed as revenue sources\nPakistan\u2019s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed. This effectively turns exporters into involuntary lenders to the state, tying up working capital and raising borrowing costs. Smaller and mid-sized exporters \u2014 essential for diversification \u2014 are hit hardest.\nIn competing economies, exports are genuinely zero-rated, with automated refunds and minimal compliance burdens. In Pakistan, exporters are taxed first and refunded later \u2014 if at all \u2014 despite already having to self-provide basic infrastructure, security, and logistics. This fiscal approach treats exports as a short-term revenue stream rather than a long-term growth strategy.\nEnergy costs that destroy competitiveness\nHigh and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation. Penalising captive power to force grid usage has reduced industrial flexibility while merely shifting circular debt from electricity to gas. Given Pakistan\u2019s concentration in low value-added exports, where energy is a large cost component, this disadvantage is decisive.\nLow value-added exports\nPakistan\u2019s export base remains narrow and low value. Textiles dominate, but largely at the yarn, fabric, and basic garment level \u2014 segments with thin margins and intense competition. Some firms have exited higher value-added apparel altogether, whilst others are contemplating relocating production abroad. By contrast, Bangladesh invested in scale, compliance, and female labour participation to move up the garment value chain, while Vietnam diversified into electronics, engineering, and services.\nGlobal demand is also shifting away fromcottontoward man-made fibres, weakening Pakistan\u2019s traditional advantage. Without deliberate upgrading, innovation, and branding, export diversification will remain elusive \u2014 even as Pakistan\u2019s land, water, and human capital offer opportunities in horticulture, livestock, dairy, seafood, minerals, information technology, and professional services.\nWeak standards\nFood and agricultural exports face persistent quality and hygiene challenges. Inadequate domestic testing facilities force exporters to rely on foreign laboratories, raising costs and delays. Training and certification infrastructure remain underdeveloped. While exporters are allowed to open overseas marketing offices, funding limits are too low to support brand development or to secure shelf space. As a result, Pakistani brands have minimal global presence outside diaspora markets.\nProtectionism that rewards inefficiency\nHigh tariffs and ad-hoc import restrictions raise input costs and disrupt supply chains. Recent changes under the Export FacilitationScheme\u2014 denying refunds on certain imported inputs \u2014 further penalise exporters.\nProtection has encouraged firms to prioritise secure domestic margins over global competitiveness. Medium-sized exporters, lacking inventory buffers, suffer most. Domestic consumers pay higher prices for lower-quality goods, while protected firms rarely evolve into serious exporters.\nProductivity and skills gaps\nNo incentive can compensate for low productivity. Pakistani firms face unreliable energy, inefficient logistics, and shortages of technical, managerial, and digital skills. While Vietnam benefits from a disciplined workforce and Bangladesh from broad labour participation, Pakistan continues to underinvest in human capital limiting its ability to upgrade exports.\nPolicy inconsistency and weak credibility\nPerhaps the most damaging constraint is policy credibility. Export policies are announced without consultation, applied unevenly, and reversed under fiscal pressure. Temporary incentives and shifting rules discourage long-term investment. Export growth requires confidence that policies will endure beyond the next crisis.\nBoth the government and businesses must change\nWhile policy failures dominate, the private sector also bears responsibility. Too many firms focus on lobbying for protection rather than investing in competitiveness, innovation, and new markets. Despite duty-free access to the European Union and UK, Pakistan\u2019s textile market share has stagnated, while China and Vietnam, despite tariffs, have expanded through superior cost, quality, and reliability.\nPakistan will not scale exports through episodic devaluations, temporary incentives, or punitive taxation disguised as reform. What is needed is macroeconomic stability, a predictable and competitive exchange rate, affordable energy, rationalised tariffs, a truly zero-rated export regime with automatic refunds, and sustained investment in skills. Until exports are treated as central to economic survival rather than a revenue afterthought, ambitious targets \u2014 such as $63bn \u2014 will remain out of reach.\nThe writer, a former CEO of Unilever Pakistan and of the Pakistan Business Council, serves on the boards of several public companies.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 12th, 2026",

      "fullText": "\u2022 Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months\u2022 Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector\nISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).\nWhile testifying before the National Assembly\u2019s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr\u00ado\u00adleum Minister Ali Per\u00advaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.\nThe minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.\nInterestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared topetrol and dieselwhich are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.\nIn the last week of November 2025, Ogra haddeterminedup to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra\u2019s determination within 40 days.\nThe minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan hadconcludedsuccessful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac\u00adh\u00aded to manage excess supplies.\nMNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector\u2019s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.\nThe minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been \u201cquelled\u201d, which was a critical reform measure.\nSui gas companies\u2019 managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.\nThe Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.\nCommittee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.\nOfficials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.\nNo domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.\nThe committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.\nThe minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.\nThe committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2026",

And now if we stop them, the builders make a fuss that they are being bothered.\u201d\nHe highlighted that many buildings do not have materials to extinguish fire available inside the buildings, and stressed the need for fire exits to be properly marked.\nAt around 4pm, South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso toldDawnthat the fire had been brought under control by up to 70pc.\nSpeaking toGeo News, DC Khoso said authorities were gathering information about the number of people trapped inside the building.\n\u201cWe have cordoned off the area and are trying to extinguish the blazes phase-wise,\u201d he said.\nRescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Abid Jalal toldGeo Newsin the afternoon that \u201cfirefighting is underway from all three sides\u201d.\nHe also said that the fire had been brought under control by about 70-75pc. However, he stressed that the building was very dilapidated.\n\u201cThe backside has collapsed, and the front area is also about to collapse.\u201d\nTerming flammable material inside the mall as the \u201cbiggest challenge\u201d in fully dousing the blaze, COO Jalal pointed out that accessing the building was very difficult.\n\u201cSending firefighters inside right now is not without danger,\u201d the rescue officer said. Therefore, he added, the team\u2019s strategy was to control the fire first and then begin the search once they were able to enter the mall.\nCOO Jalal detailed that over 125 people, including firefighters, were engaged in the ongoing operations and about 20-22 vehicles of the fire brigade were involved.\nADawnNewsTVcorrespondent present at the site reported that all sides of the mall had been impacted, with one having \u201ccompletely collapsed\u201d.\nHe added that several people had come to look for their relatives, including shopkeepers working at the mall.\nDelhi Colony residents Mansoor and Jameel toldDawnNewsTVthat they were unable to contact six of their family members who had come to Gul Plaza last night for shopping.\nThey said their last contact was at around 10:10pm last night, after which their mobile numbers were not reachable. The missing members comprised three women, two men and a 14-year-old girl.\nSpeaking to the media at the site in the afternoon, Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad said the search for missing people will begin after the fire has been put out and the cooling process has been completed.\n\u201cThere were goods such as crockery, clothes, electrical appliances, cosmetics and perfumes in various shops, due to which the fire intensified,\u201d Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan explained.\nThe spokesperson added that on Sunday morning, 20 fire tenders from different departments and institutions were being employed to extinguish the blaze.\n\u201cBut the building appears very old, and there is a danger that its structure may fall at any time because of the impact of the fire. Thus, the rescue operation is being carried out with extreme caution,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen we arrived, the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames,\u201d Khan toldReuters.\nA Rescue 1122 spokesperson toldBBC Urduearly on Sunday that the fire \u201cspread over 8,000 square yards is very intense and the process to extinguish it [fully] could take one to two days\u201d.\nEarlier in the day, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed also confirmed that six bodies and 11 injured had been brought to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) so far. State-runAPPreported that an emergency has been declared at the hospital.\nIn a statement run byAPP, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said \u201cmore than 17 people\u201d had been taken to hospitals due to suffocation, several of whom were discharged after receiving medical treatment.\nNoting that Gul Plaza was an old building, he said the final cause of the fire will only be known after the completion of investigations. He added that 40 snorkels were taking part in the operation.\nA firefighter identified as Furqan Shoukat also lost his life during the fire-extinguishing efforts, according to a statement by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.\n\u201cIn this time of grief, we stand with the family of martyred Furqan and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation will provide full support to its martyred employees,\u201d the mayor was quoted as saying byAPP.\nHe said teams and machinery are fully engaged in extinguishing the fire.\nIn a separate statement, Wahab said all municipal departments have been directed to provide full support to the victims.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate statement reported by state-runRadio Pakistan, also expressed sorrow over the firefighter\u2019s death.\nHe highlighted that Furqan sacrificed his life while saving the public, and prayed for his elevated ranks.\n\u201cIt appears to have been caused by a circuit breaker,\u201d Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho told reporters at the site, noting that Gul Plaza housed around 1,200 shops and also had a basement.\n\u201cThe layout and construction of this market was such, and secondly, the nature of the items in it \u2014 such as carpets, blankets and other objects made of resins \u2014 so the fire is still simmering because of these.\u201d\nGarden Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Mohsin Raza also said in a statement on Saturday night that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit at one of the shops, before spreading to the entire mall.\nSindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed officials to divert traffic in the area to alternative routes for the safe passage of citizens.\nIn a statement, he said that the cause of the fire should be ascertained through a thorough investigation. He said that the building should be secured so that the fire does not spread.\nThe minister said the routes should be cleared so that fire brigade vehicles could access the scene.\nA Sindh Rangers spokesperson said in a statement that personnel had been deployed to the scene of the incident.\n\u201cRangers personnel are actively participating in rescue activities and rescue operations along with the fire brigade staff,\u201d the statement, which was issued shortly after the fire erupted, said. \u201cOfficers and personnel will remain at the scene until the rescue operation is completed.\u201d\nThe statement further read that in addition to aiding in rescue operations, a contingent of Rangers had been deployed to cordon off the building for the safety of civilians and to ensure traffic flow.\n\u201cAlongside fire tenders, Rangers personnel are evacuating trapped people and ensuring the safety of valuables,\u201d the statement read, adding that protecting lives and preventing the fire from further spreading was a top priority.\nTraders feared huge losses as their goods were reduced to ashes by the blaze.\nWhile the estimates vary, the All City Traders Ittehad Association (ACTIA) estimated losses worth around Rs2-2.5 billion, including \u201crepair and reconstruction costs\u201d.\nIn a statement, ACTIA patron-in-chief Sharjeel Goplani said chairman Zahid Amin and other members of the association had conducted an assessment of the affected mall.\nAddressing the Sindh government and the prime minister, Goplani said, \u201cCurrently, 1,200 traders have suffered losses. This should be compensated immediately.\u201d\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz expressed their deep grief over the fire at Gul Plaza and the resulting loss of lives.\nIn a statement reported byAPP, the premier instructed that all possible assistance should be provided to the affected traders and other individuals, and that all necessary facilities should be provided to the injured.\nHe stressed that all relevant departments should work together in the rescue operation.\nIn his statement, President Zardari directed that the Sindh government \u2014 which is of his PPP \u2014 and the relevant authorities \u201cprovide immediate and every possible assistance to the affected people and the traders\u201d.\n\u201cNo stone should be left unturned in providing the best medical facilities to the injured,\u201d the statement quoted him as saying.\nMemon, in a statement reported byAPP, said the Sindh government will decide the future course of action after a complete assessment of the losses.\nThe minister said that whether it is the trader community or other affected individuals, the government will make every effort to provide maximum possible assistance within the framework of law and regulations.\nTaking notice of the incident, CM Murad issued orders to Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi for an immediate inquiry into the matter and to prepare a report on the cause of the fire.\nCM Murad was briefed about the incident earlier in the day at the CM House by Commissioner Naqvi and DC Khoso, who informed him that the fire broke out between 9:45pm and 10:15pm.\n\u201cThe fire safety arrangements in the building should be inspected,\u201d CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement.\nHe ordered the strict implementation of fire safety rules and action against those whose negligence or carelessness would be proven.\n\u201cA fire safety audit should immediately be conducted of Karachi\u2019s commercial buildings,\u201d CM Murad said.\nAccording to the briefing, more than 1,200 shops were gutted in the incident. A massive emergency response was launched, involving 22 fire brigade vehicles, 10 water bowzers, four snorkel vehicles, and 33 Rescue 1122 ambulances.\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed CM Murad and Wahab to deploy all resources to control the fire.\nExpressing grief over the loss of lives and property, he demanded an immediate probe into the blaze and ordered that steps be taken to prevent such future tragedies.\nSindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah visited the site of the incident earlier in the day to assess the rescue operations.\nThe South deputy commissioner and Rescue 1122 officials briefed him on the steps taken to control the fire.\nThe chief secretary issued orders for the deployment of all available fire tenders and additional rescue workers.\nSoon after the fire began, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had also visited Gul Plaza, where he was briefed on the rescue and relief operations.\nStanding alongside the traders whose shops were ablaze, the governor issued directives for the rehabilitation of the affected.\nPrior to his visit, in a statement from his office, Tessori expressed concern over the incident and ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations.\nHe also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.\nGul Plaza has witnessed fire incidents in the past as well.\nInAugust 2016, more than 25 shops were burnt in a huge fire that broke out in the multi-storey market. It was believed that a short circuit caused the fire.\nA fire at a warehouse in Gul Plaza inAugust 2008, also caused by an electric short-circuit, destroyed some goods. However, no casualty was reported.\nFires frequentlyeruptin buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.\nAt a conference in October 2025 followingmultiplefireincidents, city planners, fire experts and disaster management authorities raisedserious concernsover the deteriorating state of fire preparedness in Karachi.\nThey urged authorities to take immediate action to align the metropolis\u2019s fire safety systems with international standards, warning that the current state leaves the city dangerously exposed to large-scale emergencies.\nIn December, the Sindh Assemblyvoted unanimouslyin favour of an opposition-sponsored resolution that called for the comprehensive modernisation of Karachi\u2019s inadequate and substandard firefighting system.\nAdditional input from Reuters",

      "summary": "The Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. The Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran\u2019s economic problems. Inflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Iran\u2019s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. Total exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, according to the IMF. Iran's economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown. GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022. By 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 suggest a near-stagnant rate of 0.3pc to 0.6pc.",
      "fullText": "Iran\u2019s economy is going through one of its most difficult periods in years, fueled by sanctions, high inflation, and a significant drop in the value of the national currency, the rial.\nThese pressures have had a direct impact on living standards and have also fueled recent protests.\nThe protests began on Dec. 28 in commercial hubs in the capital Tehran, when shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners staged strikes and demonstrations to protest soaring inflation, the collapsing rial, and deteriorating economic conditions, and have since grown into nationwide anti-government expressions of discontent involving workers, students, and others across multiple cities.\nThe Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran\u2019s economic problems amid the protests. Masoud Pezeshkian said the government admits to \u201cshortcomings and problems\u201d and is working hard to alleviate the people\u2019s concerns, especially on the economy.\nThe Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. It started last year at around 817,000 rials per $1, then sank to 1.42-1.47 million rials on the parallel market by late 2025.\nDue to the rial\u2019s sharp decline, most Iranians have struggled to keep up with steadily rising prices.\nThe currency has been suffering for years in the face of sanctions and inflationary pressures, going from about 34,000 rials to the US dollar in 2016 to around 270,000 in 2021 and some 430,000 in 2022.\nBy 2023-2024, the rial had crossed the 750,000 mark on the open market, and its depreciation accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the rial has lost nearly 800 per cent of its value, and as of this week, it trades at around 1.5 million rials to the dollar, severely eroding household purchasing power.\nAs the rial weakened, import costs shot up, feeding inflation and forcing businesses to raise prices. For ordinary Iranians, the falling currency has wiped out savings, reduced purchasing power, and created fear that prices will continue rising.\nTraders and shopkeepers have been among the first to protest, as they struggle to afford goods amid daily currency swings.\nInflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Middle- and lower-income families are increasingly forced to cut back on basic goods.\nConsumer price inflation remains exceptionally high, with inflation estimated at 30.6pc in 2020 before rising sharply to 43.4pc in 2021 and staying elevated at around 44pc\u201346pc in both 2022 and 2023.\nAlthough inflation eased to about 32.5pc in 2024, it is projected to accelerate again, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting inflation of 42.4pc in 2025 and remaining above 40pc in 2026, underscoring the persistence of price pressures driven by currency weakness and structural constraints.\nFood costs and staples have grown much faster, with sectoral inflation (such as bread and fruit) substantially outpacing the national rate.\nThe Statistical Centre of Iran reported that food inflation last September reached 58pc, more than double the rate in the same month the previous year. According to the survey, fruit costs have soared 75pc while bread and grains, which are staples in Iranian households, have almost doubled in price.\nAlthough the government provides cash handouts and subsidies, including monthly payments, and food staple, electricity, and foreign exchange subsidies, these measures have not offset the impact of rising prices, especially as the value of payments declines alongside the rial.\nIran\u2019s economy is still severely hampered by international sanctions. US sanctions limit access to the international financial system, banking transactions, and oil exports. Even when Iran is successful in exporting oil, access to hard currency is often restricted, delayed, or held overseas.\nAccording to aReuterssurvey, Iran\u2019s oil output fell by 100,000 barrels per day in late 2025 due to the sanctions, which directly cut into government revenue.\nTotal exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, while imports are expected to fall by roughly 10pc to $98bn, according to the IMF, reflecting tighter foreign exchange and sanctions pressure.\nIn 2025, the IMF projected a 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) decline in both output and exports as of last May. A greater decline of up to half a million bpd has been projected by independent energy analytics companies, including Kpler, Vortexa, and TankerTrackers.\nAs a result, foreign exchange inflows have fallen, and the Central Bank\u2019s capacity to maintain currency stability has been eroded. Additionally, sanctions have hindered trade and discouraged foreign investment, pushing Iran to rely on unofficial routes that raise prices and decrease transparency.\nIran\u2019s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. In the fiscal year that ended last March, Iran\u2019s Central Bank estimated oil revenues of $67bn. The bank reported oil revenues of $56bn for fiscal 2024, $55bn for 2023, $38bn for 2022, and $23bn for 2021.\nHowever, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the export figures vary. In the calendar year 2018, when the first Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran, oil revenues reached $51bn, according to the EIA. In 2020, they sank to $5bn, before rebounding to $43bn in 2024.\nIran\u2019s fiscal position remains under strain, with the government running persistent budget deficits amid constrained revenues and rising spending pressures.\nAccording to IMF-based estimates, the budget deficit stood at around 4.1pc of GDP in 2024 and is expected to widen to about 6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, before remaining elevated at roughly 6.2pc of GDP in 2026. The deterioration reflects limited oil revenue recovery under sanctions, weak non-oil tax collection, and higher outlays on subsidies, wages, and social support, adding to inflationary and currency pressures.\nIn its most recent budget, the government estimated daily oil shipments of 1.85 million barrels per day at $67 per barrel. However, the IMF projected that actual exports would only average 1.1 million barrels per day, showing a significant deficit.\nOver the last five years, Iran\u2019s economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown.\nAfter a period of lost growth in the late 2010s, GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022, largely driven by a recovery in oil exports and domestic services following the pandemic. This momentum peaked in 2023 with a 5.3pc expansion, but the trajectory has since cooled considerably.\nBy 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 from the IMF and the World Bank suggest a near-stagnant rate of just 0.3pc to 0.6pc. This recent deceleration is attributed to intensified sanctions, chronic inflation (averaging near 40pc), and severe energy shortages that have hampered industrial productivity.\nWhile the oil sector remains a primary driver of the nominal economy \u2014 which fluctuated between $350bn and $475bn \u2014 non-oil sectors continue to struggle under structural constraints and a weakening currency.\nIn addition, the labour market over the last five years has been characterised by a jobless recovery followed by a tightening market amid recent economic stagnation. Official figures showed the total unemployment rate declining from 9.3pc in 2021 to a record low of approximately 7.2pc to 8.2pc by late 2024.\nYouth unemployment remains a critical challenge, consistently hovering between 20pc and 23pc, nearly triple the national average.\nHeader image: Photo showing protesters taking to the streets in Tehran as police personnel stand atop a vehicle. \u2014 Anadolu Agency",

      "fullText": "ABOUT 14,400 years ago, a weeks-old wolf puppy ate its last meal \u2014 meat from a woolly rhinoceros \u2014 shortly before dying on the harsh Ice Age landscape of northeastern Siberia.\nIn a first, researchers have extracted DNA and recovered the rhino\u2019s genome from a chunk of undigested meat from the stomach contents found in the puppy\u2019s remains, discovered in permafrost near the village of Tumat. These genome findings provided insight into the fate of this impressive cold-adapted horned herbivore species once common in northern Europe and Asia.\nThe researchers compared this rhino\u2019s genome to those of two other individuals from the same species that lived thousands of years earlier \u2014 about 18,000 and 49,000 years ago \u2014 to examine genetic changes over time. In doing so, they learned that the woolly rhinoceros as a species remained genetically healthy until the end of the Ice Age before apparently suffering a rapid population collapse, probably because the warming climate erased their preferred steppe-tundra environment.\nFor instance, the newly recovered genome showed no evidence of inbreeding suggestive of population decline. Other research has indicated that the woolly rhinoceros disappeared about 14,000 years ago, just a few hundred years after this individual lived.\n\u201cWith this research we demonstrate that it is possible to recover a high-quality genome from poorly preserved material dating to a crucial time in the life history of a species,\u201d said evolutionary geneticist Solveig Gudjonsdottir, lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution.\n\u201cIt is a very cool achievement,\u201d said evolutionary geneticist and study co-senior author Love Daln of the Centre for Palaeogenetics, a collaboration between Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The woolly rhinoceros, whose species name is Coelodonta antiquitatis, first appears in the fossil record about 600,000 years ago.\nIt became one of the many large mammals to go extinct around the end of the last Ice Age, along with such species as woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, mastodons and giant ground sloths, all of which faced ominous environmental changes as the climate warmed, as well as pressure from human hunting.\n\u201cThe woolly rhinoceros was a large animal, reaching up to around 2 meters (7 feet) tall, and was covered in thick, long fur,\u201d said Gudjonsdottir, who worked on the study while a master\u2019s student at Stockholm University. \u201cIt had two horns, a large hump on its back, a stocky build and relatively short legs. The species was primarily a grazer, feeding on grass and low vegetation adapted to cold, dry environments,\u201d Gudjonsdottir added.\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

The department said the recovery indicated planning to target sensitive installations in multiple cities.\nIn a statement, the CTD spokesperson said the department carried out 425 intelligence-based operations across Punjab to pre-empt potential terrorist activity. During these operations, 427 suspects were questioned and 49 individuals were arrested for alleged involvement in terrorism-related activities. Weapons, explosives and other prohibited material were also seized, the spokesperson said.\nThe arrested suspects include Shaukat, Naveed, Abdul Rehman, Amjad, Shahid, Abrar, Danish Khan, Khalil Ahmed, Jamil-ur-Rehman, Ehsanullah, Nader, Waqas, Hasnain, Farooq, Jamshed and Awlad Khan, among others. CTD said the suspects were linked to Fitna-ul-Khawarij and other banned organisations.\nTakes 49 suspects in custody in other activities in a month-long operation\nThe arrests were made from multiple districts, including Lahore, Sahiwal, Rawalpindi, Toba Tek Singh, Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Jhelum, Dera Ghazi Khan, Faisalabad, Chiniot, Pakpattan, Khushab, Okara, Attock, Sheikhupura and Vehari.\nDuring the operations, CTD claimed to have recovered 16,480 grams of explosives, two hand grenades, 36 detonators, 58 feet of safety fuse wire, six improvised explosive device (IED) bombs, pamphlets and magazines of banned organisations, SIM cards, mobile phones and cash.\nThe spokesperson said the suspects had planned attacks on important buildings in different cities. He added that 44 cases had been registered against the arrested individuals, while further investigation was under way to determine their networks and facilitators.\nSeparately, CTD, with the support of local police and other security agencies, conducted 6,131 combing operations across the province. During these operations, 243,546 individuals were checked, 599 suspects were arrested, 568 FIRs were registered and 477 recoveries were made.\nReaffirming its commitment to maintaining security, the CTD spokesperson said the department was working to ensure a safe Punjab and would continue action against terrorists and anti-state elements. He urged citizens to report suspicious activity to the CTD Punjab helpline at 0800-11111.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "IQBAL works as a driver with a rent-a-car company. He is usually working six to seven days a week. The company pays him around Rs30,000 as salary. He does make some more as overtime, and though that amount varies by the month, on average he gets another Rs20,000 or so. Adding tips to the total, he makes around Rs65,000 per month. He has a wife and two children who are still in school.\nUp to a couple of years ago, Iqbal was able to save a bit every month from his income. But the inflation over the last few years has made his budget a lot more constrained. He is barely able to meet all his routine expenses now. Electricity and gas bills have increased a lot. And the food bill has also almost doubled. He is actively on the lookout for extra driving jobs now so that he can get more overtime payment. He has started skipping lunch unless a client is generous enough to give him lunch or money for lunch.\nThis is not an isolated case. In their article (\u2018People are eating less\u2019) in this paper last week, Zafar Mirza and Miftah Ismail, giving numbers from the Household Integrated Expenditure Survey 2024-25, have shown that people are indeed eating less and they have had to tighten their belts further to make ends meet. And this is true for not just lower-income groups but middle-income groups as well.\nWhat has made life a lot harder for Iqbal and his family has been a health shock. His wife has blood pressure and diabetes and has recently been diagnosed with some liver ailment. Doctor\u2019s fee, expenses for diagnostic testing and regular costs of medicines have pushed Iqbal into debt. He has been forced to borrow from his relatives, friends and any clients he felt would be kind enough to help him or lend him money.\nWe need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generation opportunities.\nEach month is a struggle now. Medical expenses are a constant addition to his monthly expenses, but his income has not gone up and there does not seem to be any prospect of income growth either. He has essentially fallen into a debt trap. He has accumulated a significant amount of debt, which there is little possibility of paying, and has no ability to raise further debt. But monthly expenses continue to be higher than his income.\nWhat is a person like Iqbal supposed to do?\nThis is not the story of just one household in Pakistan. It is the story of a significant proportion of the population of the country. If people have no savings, shocks can be devastating and can push households into debt and poverty. The most common shock seems to be health shocks. For a household of five to six people \u2014 the norm in Pakistan \u2014 with one or two earners, and with grandparents and children, health shocks are not a surprise at all.\nDiabetes, blood pressure, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and many other ailments \u2014 a lot of them requiring medium- to long-term and continued care \u2014 are quite common in Pakistan. With 40 per cent or so of children afflicted with malnutrition, youngsters falling ill is not unexpected either.\nThe state does not provide good healthcare facilities. Public sector provision is not only patchy and of poor quality in general, it is also not available everywhere. And private healthcare is expensive. Whenever Iqbal has taken his wife to the public hospital, he has been told to get diagnostic tests done from private laboratories and he has also had to pay for all the medicines. Only the doctor\u2019s fee is subsidised by the state. But diagnostic tests are quite expensive. Medicines, too, are expensive and have become even more costly over the last few years.\nDo bear in mind that we do not provide any income support through our social protection institutions and programmes to those who are above very low-income levels. The Benazir Income Support Programme is for the very poor and does not extend beyond. There are no programmes for the working or low-income poor.\nWhat could be the way out for Iqbal? Can he increase his income? He could try to work more hours. That is not easy though. He could pull out one or more of his children from school and push them into the workforce. But given the unemployment rates in the country, this is not much of an option, especially if the children are still in the early to middle stages of their education. And the loss in terms of a child not completing his or her education is seen in the medium- to long-term damage to the country.\nIt is at the level of the state that we can actually change things. In fact, it is the responsibility of the state to do so. A large proportion of Pakistanis have fallen on hard times, even a larger proportion has become more vulnerable to shocks than before. It is the responsibility of the state to do something about this. It is here, even in terms of intentions, that we do not find anything. We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generating opportunities for people. And we need to think about extending support to those who are falling on hard times. Probably the best way to do this \u2014 and this is being done and has been done in many countries \u2014 is to extend health and education facilities of decent quality to all citizens, especially those who are struggling. This could help a lot of people in major ways. But, of course, in an elitist and elite-captured state, this will not happen easily. It will require a major overhaul of the governance system and governance ethos in the country. This, at least for now, does not seem to be on the horizon.\nThe writer is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives and an associate professor of economics at Lums.\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2026",

The crane was working on a high-speed rail project when it collapsed and hit the passing train, causing it to derail and briefly catch fire.\nPrime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told the State Railway of Thailand to provide good compensation for families of the dead, adding in comments to reporters after being briefed at the scene: \u201cWe need to investigate... and take legal action.\u201d The Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited , which was contracted to build the rail segment, expressed regret for the accident and said it would provide compensation and relief to families of the casualties.\nIn March last year, a 30-storey building under construction in Bangkok by a joint venture including ITD collapsed, killing 89 people, after an 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck neighbouring Myanmar.\nITD President Premchai Karnasuta was indicted in August along with 22 others on allegations of negligence and breaching construction regulations. The executive and 14 others denied wrongdoing when they were first arrested in May.\nSmoke billows from wreckage\nImages shared by the ministry showed train carriages overturned next to shrubland and firefighters extinguishing a blaze as smoke billowed out. Earlier footage of the crash site showed rescue workers trying to extract casualties from one of the mangled carriages, with some badly injured passengers already being loaded into ambulances.\nThe elevated high-speed rail project, one of several under construction in Thailand, was being built above the existing rail line. Part of the collapsed crane is still propped up by the concrete stanchions built to support the new rail link, with debris dangling over the tracks below.\nThe construction is part of the Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima segment of the transnational high-speed rail project linking the Thai capital with the southwest Chinese city of Kunming.\nRecovery operations at the accident scene continued into Wednesday evening with Anutin saying the track needed to be cleared by the end of the week. He noted that this was a major rail route and delays would hurt the regional economy.\nHigh-speed link\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the Beijing government attached great importance to the safety of projects and personnel in Thailand and was looking into the situation.\n\u201cAt present, it seems that the relevant section was under construction by a Thai enterprise. The cause of the accident is still under investigation.\u201d The cross-country high-speed rail project will connect to China through Laos. The government said last year that more than a third of construction had been completed in the segment connecting Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima, with the whole line to Nong Khai at the border with Laos ready by 2030.\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

      "fullText": "The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) on Friday warned that Pakistan\u2019s industrial sector was facing asevere crisisdue to high energy tariffs and heavy taxation, leading to widespread factory closures and job losses.\nIn December, it wasreportedthat over 100 spinning mills and over 400 ginning factories had become non-operational, triggered by unprecedented taxes, high power tariffs, and a surge in under-invoiced cotton yarn and fabric imports from China and other countries.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Islamabad, President FPCCI Atif Ikram Sheikh said, \u201cCostly electricity has crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector.\u201d\n\u201cAround 150 large textile units had shut down over the past two years,\u201d he stated.\nSheikh urged the government to immediately abolish cross-subsidies imposed on the industrial sector and reduce the policy rate to single digits.\nHe proposed thatinterest ratesbe cut first to nine per cent and subsequently to seven per cent to revive industrial growth and investment.\nTrader and business leader SM Tanvir said that the situation had also been highlighted in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2026 report, which increased Pakistan\u2019s risk rating.\n\u201cAccording to the report,\u201d he said, \u201cThe business activity and employment opportunities in the country are declining, while the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector has been reduced to a junkyard.\u201d\nTanvir criticised tax policies, saying \u201cnon-filers face no scrutiny when depositing money in banks, but are heavily taxed\u201d. \u201cIt appears the Federal Board of Revenue is working to please banks,\u201d he alleged.\nFPCCI officials warned that if the government failed to urgently address the issue of expensive electricity, the industrial sector could come to a \u201cstandstill\u201d.\nThe officials criticised the government and the Power Division for not passing the relief of reduction in electricity tariff to the industrial consumers.\nRecently, after NEPRA determined areductionin the base tariff of electricity, the power division maintained that the number of domestic consumersavailingsubsidised rates was very high.\nThey emphasised that there was additional electricity available in the country, but the capacity charges for unused power units were paid by the citizens of the country.\nFurthermore, they highlighted that the industrial tariff was around 12.5 cents per unit in Pakistan, whereas it was around 7.5 cents in India.\nThey appealed to the prime minister to \u201cremove the industry from the ventilator\u201d and reduce taxes on the export sector to prevent further economic decline.\nAccording to ananalysis, Pakistan\u2019s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed.\nIt further said that high and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation.",

      "fullText": "The exchange rate is a critical economic variable for Pakistan. A competitive and credible currency regime should form the core of the nation\u2019s economic strategy, particularly given the country\u2019s dependence on foreign exchange for growth.\nUnfortunately, Pakistan has repeatedly used the exchange rate as a short-term stabilisation tool, often holding it at levels that favour political convenience rather than economic fundamentals. Once reserves are depleted, this approach has led to abrupt and disruptive corrections consistently undermining rather than enhancing export potential.\nThat said, it is incredibly important to have a competitive exchange rate as it improves export margins, encourages investment in tradable goods, and signals the viability of producing for global markets.\nHistory shows that prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports\nHowever, rate alone is insufficient; credibility is equally essential. Exporters are willing to invest and scale up operations only if they trust that relative prices will remain broadly aligned with fundamentals over time. In Pakistan\u2019s case, this trust has been repeatedly eroded.\nThe Musharraf era\nDuring the Musharraf administration, the rupee was kept stable at around Rs60 to the dollar throughout much of the 2000s. While this stability created an illusion of macroeconomic soundness, it concealed growing external imbalances.\nWhen the pressures finally surfaced, the adjustment was late and severe: from 2007 to 2009, the rupee dropped from roughly Rs60 to over Rs80 per dollar as reserves collapsed and an International Monetary Fund intervention became necessary. Exporters, who had operated under an overvalued currency, did not suddenly become competitive. Instead, they faced higher input costs, disrupted financing, and weakened financial positions.\nStability over fundamentals\nThe above pattern recurred between 2013 and 2017, with the rupee held between Rs100\u2013105 per dollar despite widening current-account deficits and falling reserves. Exporters consistently warned about the currency\u2019s overvaluation, but policy makers focused on maintaining price stability and political optics. When the inevitable adjustment occurred, it was abrupt and disorderly: the rupee\u2019s value dropped sharply in mid-2017, followed by a larger correction after 2018, reaching around Rs160 per dollar by mid-2019. This sudden realignment destabilised firms and inflation expectations instead of supporting a smooth transition.\nMarket distortions and eroding confidence\nThe last three years have proven even more damaging. Administrative controls, delayed adjustments, and the emergence of multiple exchange rates pushed pressure into informal markets.\nIn early 2023, the rupee experienced one of its steepest single-day falls, losing nearly 10 per cent within hours. Over the year, it depreciated by close to 30pc percent, at one point briefly approaching Rs300 per dollar before settling near Rs285 when administrative controls were introduced.\nThese shifts coincided with harsh stabilisation measures such as import compression, punitive interest rates, higher energy prices, and increased taxes. Any potential export gains from depreciation were negated by rising costs and collapsing confidence.\nRepeatedly underminig exports\nThese episodes highlight a clear lesson: prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax onexportsand a subsidy to imports. This encourages consumption and rent-seeking while discouraging investment in tradable sectors. When adjustment is finally forced, it comes as a crisis \u2014 too sudden and volatile to generate the intended export response. Exporters cannot recover lost markets overnight, nor can they invest amidst uncertainty and tightening financial conditions.\nGradual adjustment and integrated policy\nSuccessful export economies do not rely on dramatic devaluations. Instead, they allow gradual, market-aligned adjustments, avoid prolonged misalignments, and resist using the exchange rate as a political tool. Effective currency policy is complemented by competitive energy pricing, predictable taxation, efficient logistics, and skills development, enabling exporters to respond to price signals.\nFor example, Vietnam has pursued gradual adjustments that avoid prolonged overvaluation and limit volatility, giving exporters the confidence to invest and integrate into global value chains. Bangladesh has similarly adopted a steady crawl rather than crisis-driven devaluations, preserving export competitiveness and market share \u2014 a model Pakistan has repeatedly failed to emulate.\nConclusion: toward a credible exchange rate policy\nPakistan\u2019s core issue is not deciding between a \u2018strong\u2019 or \u2018weak\u2019 rupee. Rather, it is the persistent belief that administrative controls can substitute for competitiveness. Until the exchange-rate policy reflects fundamentals on a sustained basis and is part of a broader, credible export strategy, depreciation will remain disruptive, and exports will continue to be vulnerable to future crises.\nThe writer, a former CEO of Unilever Pakistan and of the Pakistan Business Council, serves on the boards of several public companies.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 19th, 2026",

      "fullText": "THE Punjab government\u2019s decision to restrict future official vehicle purchases to electric and hybrid models represents a significant policy shift in a province choking on toxic smog. Given the limited size of the official fleet and the gradual pace of its replacement, the move is unlikely to deliver immediate improvement in air quality. Nevertheless, by committing itself to electric and hybrid vehicles as part of its smog mitigation strategy, Punjab is sending a strong market signal to both automakers and car owners to make the shift away from petrol and diesel-powered transport towards cleaner alternatives. By linking future permissions for petrol pumps with the installation of EV charging stations, the government will fast-track the expansion of charging infrastructure and tackle the main impediment to faster EV adoption: range anxiety.\nThe importance of transition to EVs cannot be overstated. While crop burning is often blamed for toxic air quality in the province \u2014 especially in cities like Lahore \u2014 several reports conclude that the transport sector is perhaps the more permanent and leading contributor to smog conditions. Transport emissions can account for 39pc to 43pc of air pollution depending on the city, according to some assessments. These emissions are driven by a combination of low-quality fuels and aging vehicle fleets. The problem is complicated by traffic congestion, the reports argue, increasing exhaust emissions in urban areas. While the steps taken by Punjab, such as gradual electrification of mass transport systems in major cities and the distribution of thousands of e-bikes among girls are commendable, the lax enforcement of its plans to crack down on smoke-emitting vehicles is concerning. The transition towards electric mobility will take a long time, official intentions and interventions notwithstanding. Hence, the push for electric transition in the province must be accompanied by sustained, tough actions against polluting petrol and diesel vehicles if the authorities want to deliver breathable air to citizens.\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2026",

For years, this corridor allowed kinnow to reach Russia, Ukraine and Central Asian Republics within six to nine days, keeping the fruit fresh and competitive.\nWith that route blocked due to tensions with Kabul on security affairs, exporters are diverting shipments through Iran \u2014 a route that takes around 25 days, significantly increasing transit time, costs and spoilage risk. What was once a backup option has become the primary route, and even that has become geopolitically risky.\nThe fruit, which could reach Russia within six to nine days through Afghanistan, now has to be routed through Iran. This journey takes 25 days, too long for perishable fruit. But Trump\u2019s threat of 25pc tariff on countries trading with Iran has made even this backup route geopolitically risky\nAdding to exporters\u2019 anxiety are renewed threats by US President Donald Trump to impose a 25 per cent tariff on countries trading with Iran, raising fears that reliance on Iranian transit and markets could invite penalties or complicate access to Western destinations.\nGovt claims vs reality\nLast week, the federal government announced that Punjab\u2019s farmers would be allowed to export kinnow and potatoes through \u201calternative routes\u201d. Growers and exporters say the announcement offers little practical relief.\n\u201cIran was never a newly opened route,\u201d says Hanif Hanjra, a small orchard owner. \u201cIt has always been there, mainly used after Iran finishes its own mandarin crop. Calling it an alternative to Afghanistan is misleading.\u201d\nAccording to growers, Iran cannot replace the Afghan corridor in terms of speed or cost. \u201cThrough Afghanistan, kinnow would reach its destination fresh and competitive. Through Iran, the journey is simply too long for a perishable fruit. Resultantly, the shipment costs multiply manifold,\u201d Hanjra says.\nGrowers recall that Pakis\u00adtan\u2019s presence in Russ\u00adian, Ukrainian and Central Asian markets was built largely through exporters\u2019 own initiatives, particularly after Asean countries restricted kinnow import as Pakistani authorities failed to meet required documentation due to alleged demands for bribes and bureaucratic inertia.\nSajid Wining, a grower-cum-exporter who remained Pakistan\u2019s top fruit exporter for nearly 14 years, said he eventually exited the kinnow business due to chronic policy neglect. \u201cAt their peak, kinnow exports earned around $450 million annually,\u201d he said. \u201cYet fruit and vegetable exports were never trea\u00adted as a strategic priority.\u201d\nHe also criticised the fai\u00adl\u00adure to develop seedless kinnow varieties, while com\u00adpetitors such as China and Egypt moved ahead with seedless mandarins, capturing premium markets.\nPrice crash amid bumper crop\nThe crisis has hit orch\u00adard owners brutally. A former MPA and ex-tehsil nazim of Sahiwal, Ghulam Ali Asghar Lahri, said juice factories are offering as little as Rs300 per maund.\nHe revealed that a contractor who had purchased his orchard for Rs27.5 million \u2014 paying Rs1.5 million as advance \u2014 walked away from the deal, forfeiting the amount because expe\u00adcted losses were far greater. \u201cSome of my relatives are uprooting kinnow plants altogether,\u201d Mr Lahri said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see this crisis ending anytime soon.\u201d\nMohammad Mohsin Warraich, patron of Anjuman Kashtkaran, Sargodha, said the irony is that this year\u2019s kinnow crop is bumper and globally appreciated for its taste and appearance. Yet growers are being forced to sell at Rs1,200 per maund or even less, compared to Rs2,500\u20133,200 last season.\n\u201cFactory owners exploit growers by citing Afghan border closures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut only C-grade kinnow goes to Afghanistan, and its production is very low this year. A-grade fruit is exported by sea, and that route is open.\u201d\nMr Warraich added that Iran has, unlike previous years, reduced duties on kinnow imports and transit to Russia and CARs from the start of the season. \u201cSo why are prices collapsing?\u201d he asked.\nFormer MPA and citrus grower Iftikhar Gondal said kinnow production costs have multiplied since the sharp devaluation of the rupee in 2022. Fertilisers, pesticides and labour have become prohibitively expensive, while returns have collapsed.\n\u201cOne acre of kinnow orchard fetched around Rs100,000 last year; this season it is barely Rs30,000,\u201d he said. \u201cMany growers cannot even find buyers for their orchards.\u201d This uncertainty has also led to a drastic drop in land contract rates \u2014 from Rs200,000 per acre annually to Rs70,000, he said.\nMr Gondal alleged that factory owners have formed cartels to fix rates, exploiting farmers while continuing exports. He estimated that nearly 30pc of kinnow orchards have already been uprooted, with farmers shifting to maize, sugarcane and other crops.\nZahoor Haral, a mid-level kinnow grower, warned that repeated crop shocks are pushing farmers toward selling land and migrating to cities or abroad. \u201cThe rural economy is collapsing,\u201d he said, noting that contractors, labourers, transporters and shopkeepers all suffer when farmers lose purchasing power.\nHe dismissed the argument that low prices are driven by border closures alone. \u201cExporters buying kinnow at throwaway prices are not dumping it locally; they are shipping it abroad. So the excuse doesn\u2019t hold.\u201d\nShadow of sanctions\nHovering over the entire crisis is the geopolitical risk tied to Iran. Trump\u2019s threat of a 25pc tariff on countries trading with Tehran has unnerved exporters, who fear that dependence on Iranian routes could expose them to penalties or market restrictions.\nGrowers are now calling for structural reforms: the creation of Kissan Markets to allow direct sales to consumers, promotion of value addition through juice, pulp and powder processing units, and the establishment of a Citrus Control Board \u2014similar to the Sugarcane Control Board \u2014 to regulate pricing and transactions between growers and factories.\nUntil such measures are taken, orchard owners say scenes like the one at the factory gate \u2014 fathers pleading to sell fruit at any price to meet family obligations \u2014 will only multiply. And Pakistan risks losing not just export markets, but an entire citrus economy once considered a flagship of its agricultural exports, now squeezed between closed borders, rising costs and global politics far beyond farmers\u2019 control.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

The year 2025 was not merely a sequence of days; it was a collection of moments lived with friends, colleagues, and companions of circumstance. The people we worked with, laughed with, struggled alongside, and sometimes even disagreed with have left lasting impressions.\nFor many, the new year also brings change \u2014 new workplaces, new roles, or new paths altogether. And with those changes comes a quiet sense of loss. Offices once familiar, desks once occupied, routines once repeated have now become memories.\nThe simple conversations, shared tea breaks, and collective efforts will be missed. Time moves forward without mercy. The days that have gone will never return, and this realisation often leaves the human heart in confusion. What remains when everything else changes? What truly endures is character. In the end, people remember not positions or titles, but how they were treated \u2014 who cared, who stood by them, who acted with kindness when it mattered most.\nThe early days of the new year on the world stage are not quite what one might have hoped for. Hope is fragile, but hope is all that we must cling on to.

      "fullText": "NEPRA\u2019S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.\nIn fact, the power sector\u2019s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector\u2019s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector\u2019s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator\u2019s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Challenges in the power sector continue to grow as the number of poor and subsidised consumers more than doubled to 21 million in three years, offsetting a 62-paisa per unit reduction in the national average electricity rates due from Jan 1.\nIn a record and historic speed, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Mondayissuedits determination for annual tariff rebasing just a couple of hours after conducting a public hearing on the government\u2019s request. The decision drew criticism from multiple businesses, including representatives of the textile industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry.\nIn its ruling, the regulator said: \u201cAlthough the average tariff has been reduced by Rs0.62/kWh, the reduction has been eaten up by changes in the sales mix, as the number of subsidised consumers has increased exponentially from 9.5m in FY22 to 20.71m as of June 2025.\u201d\nAll these consumers fall within the consumption bracket of less than 200 units per month, with per-unit rates ranging from Rs7.74 to Rs13 against a marginal rate of about Rs25 per unit. Beyond this consumption, the per-unit rate gradually rises to Rs47 per unit, excluding taxes. \u201cWith this shift, consumption by subsidised consumers has also increased from 8.527 billion units in FY21 to 19.7bn units as of June 2025,\u201d Nepra added.\nThe regulator said the total revenue requirement of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) for 2026 decreased by Rs142bn compared to FY26, resulting in the 62-paisa per unit reduction, mainly due to a decrease in the power purchase price (PPP) for CY2026. Going forward, tariff rebasing will take place on a calendar-year basis (starting January 1) instead of the fiscal year, reducing the impact of tariff increases coinciding with high-consumption months starting July 1.\nDespite this change in the sales mix, the government decided to maintain the existing applicable tariffs for each consumer category. Out of the total determined revenue requirement of Rs3.379 trillion for Discos, Rs248bn will be covered as a subsidy from the budget.\nVarious industrialists protested the decision not to pass the 62-paisa per unit reduction to industrial consumers, calling it selective, unjustified, and discriminatory.\nIndustrial cross-subsidy tariffs continue to carry an estimated Rs5-7 per unit, a policy-driven burden that has rendered Pakistani industry regionally uncompetitive, according to Rehan Javed from Karachi. He added that removing this cross-subsidy would immediately reduce tariffs to 9-10 US cents per unit, restoring competitiveness and supporting exports.\nIndustrialists argued that uniform tariffs were being used to conceal inefficiencies rather than correct them, with costs being socialised upward through industrial tariffs instead of addressing Disco inefficiencies.\nPublished in Dawn, January 13th, 2026",

      "fullText": "Tech giants Apple and Google on Monday announced a multi-year partnership that will see Apple\u2019s next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) features, including its Siri assistant, be powered by Google\u2019s Gemini technology.\nThe collaboration marks a significant shift for Apple, which has traditionally developed its core technologies in-house.\nA joint statement said Apple selected Google\u2019s AI technology after a \u201ccareful evaluation\u201d determined it provided \u201cthe most capable foundation\u201d for the iPhone-maker\u2019s AI ambitions.\nThe announcement represents a rare alliance between two companies that have long competed in the smartphone market, where Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android operating systems dominate globally.\nHowever, the two rivals have maintained a lucrative partnership for years, with Google paying Apple billions of dollars annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices.\nThat arrangement has faced scrutiny from regulators, with the US Justice Department arguing in an antitrust case that the deal helps Google maintain its search monopoly, though a judge said the arrangement could continue.\nFinancial details of the AI arrangement were not provided.\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the partnership was \u201ca major validation moment for Google\u201d and \u201ca stepping stone\u201d for Apple to get its AI strategy on track into 2026 and beyond.\nApple reportedly also considered partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity.\nThe company co-founded by Steve Jobs is largely perceived to have stumbled in efforts to roll out AI capabilities across its products and last month announced the head of its artificial intelligence team was stepping down.\nApple last year delayed the release of an improved Siri digital assistant and is now promising it for later in the year.\nGoogle, Microsoft, OpenAI and other tech rivals have been releasing ever-improved AI models and features in a fierce race to lead the sector.\nDespite the collaboration, Apple emphasised that its in-house AI system, Apple Intelligence, will be used to power its iPhones and iPads at the device-only level, maintaining what it described as \u201cindustry-leading privacy standards\u201c.",

In his speech, the PPP chief highlighted the Sindh government\u2019s performance since 2008 in the fields of healthcare, education, poverty alleviation, infrastructure, industry, agriculture and revenue generation.\nFocusing on healthcare, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said Sindh had increased health sector allocations from 2.9 per cent of the provincial budget in 2008 to nearly 10pc. He also highlighted the expansion of major public hospitals, including the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where bed capacity had doubled from 1,100 to 2,200 by 2025, with a target of 3,100 beds by 2028.\nHe said that the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) operated 11 specialised hospitals and 30 chest pain units across the province. Referring to the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), he said more than 35 million patients had benefited from its services since 2008, while its bed capacity had increased from 760 to 1,926.\nAbout the education sector, the PPP chairman said that the number of public universities in Sindh had increased from 10 in 2008 to 30, along with 18 additional university campuses across the province.\nOn poverty alleviation, he said that the Sindh Rural Support Organisation (SRSO) helped lift 1.4 million women out of poverty through soft loans, with a recovery rate of 98 per cent.\nRecalling the devastatingfloodsof 2022, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said around 2.1 million houses were destroyed across the province. In response, the Sindh government launched a massive housing initiative to build 2.1 million climate-resilient homes. Of these, 750,000 had been completed, while around 1.5 million were under construction. He said the project had created nearly one million jobs.\nIn the agriculture sector, he said the provincial government distributed wheat seed worth over Rs2.1 billion to 215,000 farmers following the floods, leading to a harvest of 4.5 million tonnes the following season.\nHe claimed that public transport was virtually absent in the province before 2008, but PPP-led initiatives now facilitated daily travel for over 200,000 passengers, including through the introduction of electric buses.\nEnergy sector\nOn energy, he said Sindh had the potential to generate 50,000 megawatts of wind energy, alongside vastsolarcapacity. Currently, 1,845MW is being produced from wind projects. He said 200,000 solar home systems had already been provided to households, with another 275,000 homes set to be solarised.\nThe PPP chairman also highlighted environmental gains, saying mangrove forest cover in Sindh had expanded from 270,000 acres to a record 675,000 acres.\nAddressing revenue generation, he said the Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) had collected Rs28 billion in 2011, compared to Rs10 billion collected by the Federal Board of Revenue in 2010, a 68 per cent increase over federal collections at the time. He said the SRB\u2019s average annual growth rate of 19 per cent far exceeded the Federal Board of Revenue\u2019s 10 per cent.\nCalling for fiscal reforms, Mr Bhutto-Zardari proposed devolving the collection of sales tax on goods to provinces, arguing that provincial revenue authorities had consistently outperformed the FBR.\nMeanwhile, political circles criticised him for using the platform of the Presidency to outline the performance of the Sindh government. The event took place when Mr Bhutto-Zardari\u2019s father, President Asif Ali Zardari, was on an official visit to Bahrain. PM Adviser Rana Sanaullah said in a private TV show: \u201cBilawal should not have advocated the case of Sindh in the Presidency.\u201d\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2026",

However, the collection is 10pc higher compared to the year-ago figure of Rs5.618tr.\nThe revenue shortfall is primarily attributed to a slowdown in domestic sales tax collection, driven by several factors. The decline was also recorded in the income tax collection during 1HFY26.\nAs a result of these factors, the revenue collection fell short of target by Rs21bn in December FY26 to Rs1.425tr against the projected target of Rs1.446tr.

However, this shortfall could widen further if economic activity fails to rebound in the coming months.\nIn the FY25, the FBR missed its revenue collection target by nearly Rs163bn after two-times downward revision and collected Rs11.737tr against the revised target of Rs11.900tr. However, the collection reflects a year-on-year growth of 26.19pc from Rs9.301tr in FY24.\nIn line with its commitments under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, the government has introduced additional revenue measures totalling Rs1.05tr in the last budget. These include Rs655bn in new tax initiatives and Rs400bn through intensified enforcement. The revenue collection target for fiscal year 2025-26 is Rs14.131tr.\nThe FBR issued Rs293bn in refunds and rebates to taxpayers during July-December FY26, up from Rs277bn a year earlier, an increase of 5.77pc.\nDuring July-December FY26, income tax collection reached Rs3.26tr, falling short of target by Rs161bn against the target of Rs3.187tr.

The Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30. It projected the levy\u2019s contribution at about 1.1% of GDP over the medium term.

Cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth.",
      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: With a 1.4 percentage-point increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio last year, mostly through additional revenue measures worth Rs2.5 trillion, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) now expects the federal tax contribution to remain stagnant over the next five years and a slight improvement coming from provinces.\nThe latest IMF estimates suggest Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) receipts rose from 8.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023-24 to 10.3pc in 2024-25, but still missed the Fund\u2019s programme target of 10.7pc.\nFor the current fiscal year, the IMF projects FBR revenue at 11.1pc of GDP, which would then remain flat at that level until FY30.\nIn absolute terms, FBR revenue increased from Rs9.3tr in FY24 to Rs11.74tr in FY25, with a massive shortfall. For the current year, collections are projected at Rs13.98tr, implying a shortfall of Rs328 billion under existing assumptions.\nThe IMF noted that tax revenue collection in FY25 fell short by Rs1.224tr relative to budget projections and by Rs524bn relative to the lender\u2019s first review target. About Rs850bn of the shortfall relative to the budget reflected faster-than-expected inflation deceleration and lower-than-expected GDP growth in FY25.\nForecasts provincial taxes to offset stagnant federal collections\nThe inflation deceleration at the end of FY25 led to a revenue shortfall of Rs157bn relative to the first IMF review target. The remaining portion of about Rs380bn was broadly linked to administrative and enforcement challenges that remained unaddressed throughout FY25, chiefly because of prolonged settlement of tax court cases that delayed the recovery of significant revenue amounts.\nOverall revenues, including non-tax receipts, rose sharply to 15.9pc of GDP by the end of FY25 from 12.6pc in FY24. The Fund attributed the increase mainly to stronger receipts from the petroleum levy and State Bank profits.\nThe IMF expects the petroleum levy to remain a key source of revenue, rising from Rs1.02tr in FY24 to more than Rs2.2tr by FY30. It projected the levy\u2019s contribution at about 1.1pc of GDP over the medium term, rising to around 1.2pc in the current and next fiscal years before easing back.\nThe Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30, while the sales tax ratio is expected to hover around its existing level of 3.5-3.6pc of GDP.\nIt said major contributions are projected to come from provincial taxes on the expectations of successful implementation of the agriculture income tax and sales taxes on services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to increase from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27, rise further to 1.6pc of GDP in FY28 and then stay flat until FY30.\nIn absolute numbers, the four provinces that collected Rs929bn in FY25 are expected to deliver Rs1.22tr during the current fiscal and further improve their collection to Rs1.77tr in FY27. They would build upon this base to collect Rs2.5tr in FY28, Rs2.8tr in FY29 and cross Rs3.1tr in FY30.\nThe Fund said projected FBR collections would depend on advancing reforms to raise revenues through tax policy simplification and base broadening, supporting fiscal sustainability and creating space for climate resilience, social protection, human capital development and public investment.\nIt noted that FBR revenues rose 26pc year-on-year in FY25 to 10.3pc of GDP, a historically high level, but overall tax revenue still fell short of the target by 0.3pc of GDP, largely due to delays in resolving court cases over disputed taxes (0.4pc of GDP) and lower-than-expected inflation. Lower-than-budgeted federal subsidies and grants, estimated at 0.2pc of GDP, helped offset the impact of the revenue shortfall.\nThe IMF said provinces had begun implementing new agricultural income tax (AIT) regimes, including measures to strengthen compliance and address underreporting.\n\u201cHowever, significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, notably fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities,\u201d the Fund observed, adding that the provinces have also ensured that all services, except for a limited list of exemptions, are subject to GST.\nIt said the cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc, as has been the case for Pakistan over a long time.\nIn this way, the Fund projected the consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.4pc of GDP in FY25, easing to 4pc this year, before declining to 3.2pc in FY27 and FY28, and then to 2.8pc in FY30.\nPublished in Dawn, December 22nd, 2025",

Doctors are not \u2018traders,\u2019 and hospitals are not \u2018retail outlets\u2019. The private sector serves over 70pc of Pakistan\u2019s population. Treating healthcare providers as commercial vendors is a gross misinterpretation of a noble profession,\u201d he stated.\n\u201cWhile we respect the rule of law, audits should be conducted through documented, professional channels not through \u2018commando-style\u2019 raids that victimise healers. This targeted victimisation discourages professional excellence and pushes our brightest medical minds to seek opportunities abroad,\u201d it claimed.\nThe PMA said the doctors were ready to comply with taxation, provided there was accountability for how that money would be spent. \u201cWe demand that the tax collected from the sweat and toil of healers not be squandered on the luxurious lifestyles of the ruling elite,\u201d he stated.\nIt called upon the PM and the finance minister to take immediate notice. \u201cWe demand an immediate cessation of these aggressive tactics,\u201d Dr Shoro stated.\nHe warned that if the FBR does not immediately halt the \u2018harassment\u2019, the PMA will be forced to take the final, definitive step of a nationwide suspension of services. \u201cThe responsibility for any resulting healthcare crisis will rest solely on the shoulders of the FBR and the relevant authorities,\u201d he added.\nIn December 2025, the FBRdeployedInland Revenue Service (IRS) officers to the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, marking a shift toward on-site monitoring. The initiative gained momentum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.\nOfficial figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan\u2019s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns.\nOf the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns.\nPublished in Dawn, January 11th, 2026",

      "fullText": "Meaningful relief for compliant income tax payers, salaried individuals and the corporate sector \u2014 who together contribute roughly half of Pakistan\u2019s revenues \u2014 appears unlikely. Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead.\nTo avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy.\nThose who trust the Federal Board of Revenue\u2019s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure.\nIn 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government\u2019s economic team\u2019s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF.\nA recent media report indicates that the IMF, which is closely monitoring Pakistan\u2019s economic trajectory, also expects tax collection to remain broadly stagnant in CY26.\nThere appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best\nFrom 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratioroseto 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27.\nFBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal.\nMusadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. \u201cBoth the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.\u201d\nDr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. \u201cAt best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,\u201d he said.\nA source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. \u201cI support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF\u2019s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.\u201d\nDr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. \u201cSubstantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.\u201d\nHe also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand.\nCovering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential.\nFormer federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan\u2019s economic discourse. \u201cAll we hear is \u2018tax, tax, tax\u2019, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,\u201d he remarked.\nRehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. \u201cThere is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF\u2019s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor.\n\u201cI expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.\u201d\nChairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 29th, 2025",

      "fullText": "WITH the constitution of the 11th National FinanceCommission, the debate around revenue sharing takes centre-stage. For years, the federal government has repeated that 57.5 per cent of federal revenues are allocated to provinces, building the narrative that it is cash-strapped. This argument, while politically convenient, is misleading. When one examines the full composition of federal revenues, it becomes evident that the federal government retains close to 60pc of total revenues. A growing share of this is collected outside the NFC\u2019s divisible pool, particularly through the petroleumlevy.\nWhile politically expedient, relying on the petroleum levy and other surcharges as non-shareable revenue is deeply problematic. It bypasses the constitutional principles of the NFC, weakens the mechanism designed to ensure fair federal-provincial fiscal relations, and concentrates fiscal discretion in the hands of the federal executive. By creating a parallel pool of revenues untied to the NFC formula, the centre undermines transparency, and erodes trust in federalism. The narrative that provinces are draining the centre\u2019s resources is false and distracts from structural issues in federal finances.\nAnother persistent fallacy is the proposal that provincial transfers should be tied to performance, often implying that the centre should oversee provincial outcomes. At first glance, such arguments may seem reasonable: if resources are allocated, accountability appears justified. However, this line of reasoningmisunderstandsPakistan\u2019s fiscal federalism. The NFC was designed solely as a mechanism for revenue sharing, not as a supervisory instrument. Provinces have constitutionally defined responsibilities, strengthened by the 18th Amendment, and conditioning transfers on federal assessment risks violating the spirit of federalism.\nMoreover, if performance were to determine transfers, the principle must apply equally to the federal government, whose own failures in tax collection, exchange rate management, and debt administration directly shape the fiscal environment in which provinces operate. One-sided accountability, where provinces are scrutinised while the centre is shielded, reflects political expediency more than economic prudence.\nA permanent technical NFC will ensure debates are grounded in evidence rather than slogans.\nEqually misleading is the claim that the seventh NFC Award is responsible for the federal government\u2019s growing debt. Pakistan\u2019s debt problem arises primarily from structural weaknesses and policy failures at the federal level. Two critical areas bear particular responsibility. First, the government\u2019s exchange rate management has been erratic and often counterproductive. Persistent overvaluation in some periods, followed by sharp devaluations, has generated uncertainty, inflated the local currency value of foreign-denominated debt, and contributed to high inflation.\nSecond, Pakistan\u2019s tax policies have consistently failed to raise revenue to sustainable levels. The federal tax-to-GDP ratio remains among the lowest in the region, reflecting poor base coverage, excessive exemptions, and weak enforcement. Together, these two policy failures, poor exchange rate management and inadequate taxation, have driven deficits, forced borrowing, and worsened debt sustainability. Misattributing debt accumulation to provincial transfers allows the federal government to avoid the reforms required to stabilise public finances, including rationalising expenditure, improving state-owned enterprises\u2019 efficiency, and reforming pensions.\nRecognising these fallacies is the first step towards reform. What Pakistan urgently needs is a permanent, technically grounded NFC as a foundational layer of the NFC architecture. Currently, the NFC primarily functions as a political negotiation every five years, producing headline-grabbing percentages without rigorous analysis. A standing body of economists and fiscal experts could provide transparent, evidence-based recommendations, track revenue distribution across tiers, model alternative formulas for divisible and non-divisible pools, and ensure transfers reflect a changing development landscape.\nInstitutionalising technical expertise would transform NFC negotiations from episodic political contests into disciplined, data-driven policymaking, prevent politically motivated distortions, ensure transparency, and build trust between the centre and provinces.\nAlongside a permanent NFC, Pakistan must also deepen tax devolution to provinces and cities, but both the federal and provincial governments share responsibility for current weaknesses. While the federal government has centralised tax collection, leaving provinces with limited authority, provincial governments have often blocked local government systems and resisted meaningful devolution. This mutual reluctance has created a cycle in which provinces remain dependent on federal transfers, cities are underfunded, and citizens see limited accountability.\nStrengthening subnational fiscal capacity requires reform at both levels: granting provinces and cities meaningful tax powers, including property taxes, and unified sales taxes, while modernising revenue administrations through digitalisation and analytics. Linking local revenue mobilisation to service delivery would ensure that fiscal authority is matched with citizen expectations and that local governments can become viable instruments of governance.\nTaken together, these reforms address both the misconceptions surrounding NFC distribution and the structural realities of Pakistan\u2019s fiscal landscape. Clarifying the true share of revenues corrects the false narrative of provincial generosity undermining the centre. Instituting a permanent technical NFC ensures debates are grounded in evidence rather than slogans. Expanding tax authority to provinces and cities strengthens fiscal capacity, enhances accountability, and improves service delivery. Each of these steps contributes to a balanced federal system, where resources are aligned with responsibilities and all tiers of government are incentivised to perform efficiently.\nAddressing Pakistan\u2019s fiscal challenges requires more than debates over numbers or blame-shifting. Policymakers must commit to long-term reforms that strengthen institutional capacity, enforce fiscal discipline, and create incentives for all tiers of government to raise and manage resources effectively. By embedding technical rigour into revenue-sharing mechanisms and empowering lower tiers of governments to mobilise and utilise resources efficiently, Pakistan can build a more resilient fiscal architecture. Only through consistent, evidence-based policymaking and cooperative governance can the country ensure that public funds translate into tangible services, economic growth, and trust in federalism for the citizens it serves.\nThe writer is an associate professor of economics at the Lahore School of Economics.\nX:@waqarwadho\nPublished in Dawn, January 14th, 2026",

Overall, the country\u2019s tax revenues are projected to flatten at 11.1pc of GDP \u2014 much below the 13.3pc mark the government has committed to achieve during the current IMF programme period \u2014 all the way through FY30. What the lender is signalling is that the government has \u2018exhausted\u2019 its option to raise taxation without fixing the underlying structural problems and better enforcement, or further burdening compliant sectors of the economy, or both.\nThe government\u2019s growing dependence on non-tax revenue to prop up its fiscal position should be particularly concerning. Though the total government revenues surged to nearly 16pc of GDP in FY25, this increase has not resulted from the expansion of the tax base but from heavy petroleum levy and the State Bank\u2019s profits. The levy has quietly morphed into a permanent quasi-tax on consumption in recent years, disproportionately burdening low-middle-income households. Another worrying fact is that Pakistan\u2019s inequitable tax policy, which is over- reliant on indirect taxes while under-taxing or not taxing certain powerful lobbies, is likely to persist at the expense of economic growth and investment. That Pakistan\u2019s economic growth depends on its ability to boost tax-to-GDP ratio is confirmed by cross-country evidence cited by the Fund: countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc \u2014 precisely where Pakistan has been for a while and appears destined to remain. In sum, faster economic growth will remain a pipe dream until fiscal consolidation is achieved through structural reforms instead of what many call stealth taxation.\nPublished in Dawn, December 24th, 2025",

Agha, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rashid, FCC Registrar Hafeez Khan, along with lawyers and staff of the new establishment.\nThe FCC has a total sanctioned strength of 13 judges. Soon after its establishment, the FCC was shifted to the Islamabad High Court on a temporary basis, though it was originally envisaged that the new apex court would be housed in the building designated for the Federal Shariat Court (FSC). The FCC had to move to the IHC after FSC judges resisted the plan and denied access to their premises.\nCourtroom No. 1 has been completely revamped with new furniture and fixtures, replacing the older seating, along with the installation of a modern audio system to facilitate lawyers and litigants.\nHowever, a senior lawyer expres\u00adsed disappointment over the curre\u00adntly available facilities in the buil\u00adding. \u201cNeither is there a bar room for lawyers nor any canteen for litigants inside the FCC,\u201d Advocate Tallat Abbas Khan toldDawn, adding that lawyers had no choice but to cross the road and enter the Supreme Court building just to sit and rest after a day\u2019s work.\nHe said that since the FCC had become the country\u2019s top court, it would attract a large number of lawyers and litigants in the future, but the facilities currently available were in\u00ad\u00adsufficient to cope with the expected volume.\nInside Courtroom No. 1, lawyer Rashid Anwar complained before a three-judge bench headed by the FCC chief justice, hearing the super tax case, that he could not determine how much time he had consumed during arguments as there was no wall clock in the courtroom.\nAt this, the chief justice obser\u00adved that the present set-up lacked several facilities, but assured that the issues would be addressed soon.\nReferring to a request regarding video-link facilities to different cities, the chief justice said that while the facility was currently not available, it might be provided in the future.\nThe new FCC building houses seven courtrooms, though only three are currently functional, all located on the first floor. Recently, 22,910 cases were transferred from the Supreme Court to the FCC.\nLitigant Facilitation Centre\nIn a separate development, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi inaugurated a newly constructed room for advocates-on-record and a Litigant Facilitation Centre at the Supreme Court building as part of ongoing reforms aimed at strengthening service delivery and improving access to justice.\nSCBA President Haroonur Rashid, along with members of his cabinet, was also present on the occasion. The newly established centre will provide structured facilitation to advocates-on-record, enabling them to guide litigants on procedural requirements, case filing, documentation and related matters.\nHowever, some lawyers said the facility did not adequately cater to their needs.\nPublished in Dawn, January 13th, 2026",

Addressing the gathering, RCCI President Usman Shaukat stressed that sustainable economic growth is not possible without a fair, predictable, and growth-orientated tax regime.\nHe urged the tax authorities to reduce the excessive burden on existing taxpayers, recognise and acknowledge compliant and high tax-paying businesses, and shift the focus towards broadening the tax base instead of repeatedly taxing the same segment.\nHighlighting the issue of high taxation, President RCCI noted that when super tax and other levies are combined, the corporate tax rate effectively goes beyond 55 per cent, levels more commonly associated with developed economies. He questioned how businesses could remain competitive locally when such high legitimate tax rates are imposed, while better services and facilitation are available abroad at comparatively lower costs.\nHe emphasised that businesses are willing to be tax compliant, provided the system is fair and facilitative.\nHe further suggested non-monetary recognition mechanisms for compliant taxpayers such as recognition cards, priority facilitation at airports, and public acknowledgment stating that such measures do not impose a financial burden on the state but significantly enhance the dignity and motivation of taxpayers.\nThe RCCI president also presented key recommendations, including tax incentives for exporters, reduction in the corporate tax rate, and strong action against corrupt practices and harassment by lower-level staff under the guise of registration, audits, and enforcement, which create uncertainty and discourage voluntary compliance.\nIn her remarks, Chief Commissioner Ms Farhat Qayyum appreciated RCCI\u2019s constructive and pragmatic recommendations for broadening the tax net and sought the Chamber\u2019s continued cooperation in improving tax compliance and revenue collection.\nShe informed the participants that digitization reforms are actively underway to curb malpractices, including digital invoicing and POS system installation, aimed at enhancing transparency and minimizing human intervention.\nThe meeting was attended by Senior Vice President Khalid Farooq Qazi, Vice President Fahad Barlas, former RCCI Presidents Najam Rehan and Asad Mashadi, members of the Executive Committee, representatives of markets and trade associations, various business sectors, and members of the Tax Bar Association.\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2026",

      "fullText": "AROUND the same time last year, I wrote the economy has reached what I called \u201cpeak stability\u201d. This was a stage where all the measures taken to stabilise the economy had delivered their results, and had now reached the end of their line. A few indicators had begun to show a little stress, but around the middle of the year, in June 2025 specifically, a large inflow of almost $5.25 billion suddenlyshoredup the reserves and allowed the government to end the fiscal year with their State Bank reserves almost $500 million above the target set in the IMF programme.\n2025 saw a moderate trade deficit and surging remittances, which helped the current account balance significantly. Between January and November, the months for which data is available, the trade deficit came in around $30.5bn while remittances (including other transfers) came in at $38.8bn. Seems like a nice balance there, until you realise that something ate up $8bn out of the balance-of-payments because the overall surplus was just about $263m.\nThat something was interest payments on external debts. In 11 months of 2025, Pakistan paid $7.1bn in interest payments on its external debt. For almost a decade, from 2013 to 2022, this figure oscillated between $1.5bn to $4.0bn. Then it began to climb. Some of the increase was due to rising interest rates as the returns on 10-year US Treasury paper spiked from a Covid-era low of 1.44 per cent to 4.35pc in 2025. This was a sharp hike without doubt, and it weighed heavily on the balance-of-payments of all countries.\nBut in Pakistan\u2019s case there was something more. In June of every year for the past few years, Pakistan has been borrowing heavily from private commercial lenders in the closing month of the fiscal year to shore up its reserves. In June 2023 and 2024, for example, they borrowed almost a billion dollars from commercial creditors. Then came June 2025 and this figure leapt to $3.4bn, nearly 65pc of the inflows of that month.\nA stagnant economy cannot afford high prices, high taxes and high debt burdens for long.\nThe story is quite simple. Pakistan has balanced its external account by throttling its external trade, choking its economy and heavy borrowing, including private borrowing. Since 2023, for example, total private commercial borrowing by the country has been $7.5bn. It is not known what the maturity of these loans was, and therefore not possible to say how much has been retired and how much is still on the stock of total external debt now. But the scale of borrowing from private commercial lenders has increased massively in the past few years, just as the current account deficit has also diminished massively, if not disappeared altogether for many months at a stretch.\nThe stability in the economy cannot last much longer however. It has been earned via high taxes, a high energy price burden due to misplaced investments in the energy sector coupled with massive misgovernance. It has also been sustained through expensive borrowing, reflected at least in part by the rising burden of interest payments the economy is carrying. A stagnant economy cannot afford high prices, high taxes and high debt burdens for long.\nIn truth, we had hit peak stability a year ago. That was the moment to start transitioning out from stabilisation towards growth, on the back of some sort of reform agenda. But no reforms came. Nothing happened. The government was content to simply proclaim success on the back of stabilisation alone, thinking its job was done. All of 2025 was a grind, as a result, slogging ahead in a high-cost, high-tax and high-debt environment, with no end in sight.\nAll governments in the past have done what they are going to do in the first year or two of their tenure. Whether it was the signature reform of the federation through the 18th Amendment and the associated NFC Award in 2009 of the PPP government, or the CPEC investments and associated growth spurt of the PML-N government from 2013 to 2018, the work was largely done in the first two years, and in the latter case, took the another two years before the ribbons started being cut on the highways and power plants. The Musharraf regime spent two years stabilising the economy, and unfurled its reforms in 2002 via the telecom sector, the power reforms, and the privatisations.\nBut the present government has spent its first two years doing nothing discernible. And now they announce the return of MrIshaq Daras the exports czar, as the man who will be tasked with bringing about an export surge from here forward. This ought to be easy for him. During his finance ministership, Pakistan\u2019s exports plummeted. Maybe, if he does the opposite of whatever he did while in power we will have an export surge.\nBy now, announcements are coming with an increasing regularity, of a new committee or a new goal being set. But it is too little, too late. By now it has become clear that this government cannot punch its way out of this paper bag. They are stuck in a gruelling adjustment, weighing heavily on the citizenry and on owners of capital alike. They have juiced this lemon for all it is worth. From here on, some sort of a vision needs to kick in. Some way to unlock the growth potential of Pakistan that is tied down by layers and layers of mismanagement, bad pricing and bad legacy. But there is nothing.\nThe only way they can end this economic stalemate is with some sort of bilateral or other external injection of liquidity. It was the same way the Musharraf regime did it. Except they had 9/11 as the bonanza. We wait to see what these guys will get.\nThe writer is a business and economy journalist.\nkhurram.husain@gmail.com\nX:@khurramhusain\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

      "fullText": "LAHORE: Pakistan\u2019s rice exports recorded a strong rebound in December 2025, registering a 14 per cent month-on-month (MoM) increase compared to November, primarily driven by a more than 50pc surge in Basmati shipments.\nThe impressive performance enabled Pakistan to overtake Vietnam and emerge as the world\u2019s third-largest rice exporter, behind India and Thailand, during the month.\nAccording to trade data, Pakistan exported 489,000 tonnes of rice in December 2025, excluding shipments to Iran, compared to Vietnam\u2019s 387,000 tonnes. This marks Pakistan\u2019s best monthly rice export performance, underscoring renewed momentum in the sector.\nThe UAE remained the top destination for Pakistani rice, importing 74,897 tonnes, including 16,850 tonnes of Basmati. China followed closely with 74,685 tonnes, while other major destinations included Tanzania (62,900 tonnes), Kenya (60,300 tonnes), Ivory Coast (41,700 tonnes), Guinea-Bissau (31,850 tonnes), Malaysia (23,930 tonnes), Madagascar (17,800 tonnes), Kazakhstan (17,050 tonnes), Saudi Arabia (16,032 tonnes, including 5,350 tonnes of Basmati), the EU and UK combined (21,100 tonnes, including 15,600 tonnes of Basmati), Oman (5,770 tonnes), the United States (2,230 tonnes), and Canada (1,321 tonnes).\nDecember surge boosts rankings despite structural challenges\nA notable development during December was Pakistan\u2019s growing footprint in Central Asian markets. Exports to Kazakhstan exceeded 17,000 tonnes, including 10,300 tonnes of Basmati, while shipments to Uzbekistan stood at 10,382 tonnes. Industry experts say this reflects a structural shift, as Pakistan is now exporting directly to Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Previously, much of this trade moved indirectly through Afghanistan, but the closure of the Afghan border has prompted direct export routes, making Pakistan\u2019s presence in the region more visible.\nDespite the encouraging December figures, the rice export sector continues to face deep-rooted challenges. Structural, financial, marketing, and capacity-related weaknesses persist, with one of the most significant gaps being Pakistan\u2019s negligible exports to Iraq \u2014 currently the world\u2019s second-largest importer of Indian Basmati rice after Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Pakistan\u2019s exports to Turkiye, a key transit hub for Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and parts of Eastern Europe, remain minimal.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has recently directed authorities to formulate a comprehensive strategy to boost rice exports and reduce the widening trade deficit.\nGovernment officials have attributed the downturn to low-priced Indian rice and phytosanitary rejections at borders. However, exporters argue that Pakistan\u2019s rice sector is suffering primarily due to policy missteps.\nHamid Malik, a rice sector analyst, says the causes include intense global competition, higher global production \u2014 especially in India \u2014 weakening international demand, rising ocean freight and logistics costs, inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, irrational regulatory frameworks, inflated domestic prices caused by hoarding and undocumented money, and security-related border closures.\nAmid these challenges, Malik sees several positive developments as a silver lining. \u201cThere is strong demand for Pakistani rice in Bangladesh, although higher freight costs have eroded competitiveness.\u201d\nCentral Asian states are also emerging as promising markets since the start of Pakistan\u2019s harvesting season in October 2025. Additionally, a 50pc tariff imposed by the United States on Indian rice exports has begun to benefit Pakistan, with shipments to the US gradually picking up, says Abu Bakr, an exporter.\nAnother significant development is unfolding in Iran, where foreign exchange shortages have led the Iranian Central Bank to stop issuing subsidised foreign exchange for rice imports. Iranian traders are now importing rice using their own funds, a shift that has favoured Pakistan due to geographic proximity. Pakistani exporters report a surge in Iranian demand, while Indian exporters have been adversely affected.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "By the end of the firs quarter of the 21st century, the world had become a far more uncertain and volatile place than it was at its outset. Yet, despite conflicts, shocks and growing complexity, many countries, especially emerging economies, managed to sustain growth and make a significant dent in extreme poverty.\nPakistan also recorded progress, most notably in digitisation and connectivity. However, it has consistently underperformed relative to global peers and regional neighbours. In fact, the gap in key economic and social indicators has widened, reflecting difficulties in striking the right policy balance and restoring credibility with an increasingly anxious public and reluctant investors.\nComparable, credible and comprehensive datasets on long-term global and regional averages for key indicators such as growth and poverty are not readily accessible. Nevertheless, available online estimates consistently show Pakistan lagging not just globally but also regionally.\nOver the past 25 years, South Asia averaged growth of about 5.7 per cent compared with roughly 3.7pc in Pakistan. Average poverty is estimated at around 35pc in Pakistan, versus about 20pc regionally, while per capita income remained in the $1,000\u20131,300 range, well below the $1,800\u20132,500 recorded in South Asia.\nPakistan has ample human and intellectual resources, but ad hoc decisions and weak implementation prevent these strengths from translating into sustained outcomes\nPakistan also trails behind on most economic indicators, foreign exchange reserves, exports and industrial, agricultural, and service competitiveness, as well as social outcomes such as education, gender parity, health and employment, despite rapid gains in digitisation and connectivity.\nThose who argue that Pakistan\u2019s negative outlook is deliberately exaggerated have largely failed to substantiate their claims. While opinions among experts and business leaders vary, none disputed the broad direction of the indicators; they pointed to deeper structural causes. A senior member of the government\u2019s economic team, speaking anonymously, blamed the political preoccupation and lack of sustained focus on growth for the poor outcomes.\nA former minister went further, describing the government as part of the problem rather than the solution. \u201cThe establishment has kept the economy shackled. Each time a shift towards the market is discussed, more layers of regulations and regulators are added.\n\u201cWhere there was once a ministry of power, we now have Nepra [National Electric Power Regulatory Authority], Ogra [Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority], and numerous other regulators crowding out the private sector. No serious investor will commit capital as long as the state continues to interfere in business the way it does,\u201d he said.\nDr Nadeem ul Haq, former federal minister, attributed Pakistan\u2019s failures to a constitutional framework that entrenches winner-takes-all politics and perpetuates dynastic rule, operating through an outdated colonial governance system.\nEhsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council, identified Pakistan\u2019s failure to organise its economy around export competitiveness as a single overriding reason for its relative underperformance. Rather than building capacity to produce tradable goods and services on a global scale, the country relied on consumption-led growth, protected domestic markets, and recurring external borrowing. This model repeatedly triggered balance-of-payments crises, macroeconomic instability, and stop\u2013and\u2013go growth, deterring investment. Weak exports also translated into low-quality job creation, persistent poverty, and limited fiscal space for human development.\nWhile digitisation has improved connectivity and service delivery, in the absence of an export-oriented strategy, it has largely fuelled consumption rather than productivity. Mr Malik argued that, aligned with competitiveness, digitisation can reduce transaction costs, link firms to global markets, enable service exports, formalise businesses, and raise productivity across industry and agriculture. Embedded in an export-led framework, it can shift growth towards jobs, resilience, and foreign-exchange earnings.\nNasim Beg, a senior executive who sits on several corporate boards, views the widening income disparity as the root of Pakistan\u2019s problems. \u201cWe have failed to address our deep-rooted class divide, relying on the hope of trickle-down effects instead of taking direct action,\u201d he said.\nKhurram Mukhtar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association, attributed Pakistan\u2019s underperformance to the absence of policy continuity and institutional credibility. He said frequent reversals of economic, fiscal, and industrial policies across political cycles erode investor confidence and retards long-term planning.\nAs a result, reforms fail to mature, incentives are distorted, compliance is penalised rather than rewarded, and the economy remains trapped in short-term stabilisation. Digitisation improves connectivity, but without predictable rules and strong institutions, it cannot deliver productivity, jobs, or inclusive growth.\nMoreover, Abdul Aleem, Secretary General of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also identified the persistent lack of policy continuity as the central problem. \u201cPakistan has ample human, intellectual and physical resources, along with well-developed reform blueprints, but ad hoc decisions, frequent reversals, and weak implementation prevent these strengths from translating into sustained outcomes, like a powerful engine running on few cylinders.\n\u201cThis inconsistency erodes state capacity and investor confidence, as businesses depend on predictability in tax regimes, energy policies, trade frameworks and regulatory frameworks. Abrupt policy shifts raise costs, deter long-term investment, and limit job creation, leaving gains such as digitisation unable to deliver broad productivity gains or inclusive growth.\u201d\nNusair Teli, CEO of Pepsi Pakistan and a representative of the new generation of business leaders, was blunt in his assessment. He attributed Pakistan\u2019s stalled development to chronic political instability and egregious mismanagement, arguing that the pursuit of power has displaced responsibility. \u201cInstitutions have been overburdened with political appointments, while citizens are taxed to fund them,\u201d he said.\nWhile acknowledging the country\u2019s misfortune with leadership, he concluded that societies ultimately get the leaders they produce, raising a deeper question about the collective lack of will to demand and sustain better governance.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 19th, 2026",

      "fullText": "\nThe outlook for a consensus on the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) award currently appears murky within set timelines, both in cases of vertical and horizontal resource distribution as well as sharing of expenditures among the stakeholders.\nSo far, the working groups, according to a media report, have made limited progress, which, as per the report, makes it difficult for the consolidation of their recommendations within the time frame. The commission was due to meet in January.\nDespite the tough challenges they face, it is incumbent on all stakeholders to join hands to achieve a consensus on the new NFC award, upholding the rights of the federating units.\nNo doubt, the eight working groups set up by the federal government include issues with no easy solutions. They will recommend the percentage of resources to be distributed between the centre and the four provinces, the vertical transfers, national debt composition and its utilisation, and the inclusion or exclusion of certain taxes in the divisible pool.\nProvincial representatives insist on greater autonomy, citing increased tax revenue collection over the past year, even as the NFC award continues to be delayed\nThe centre, says a The Express Tribune analyst, wants to exclude customs duties from the purview of the divisible pool that is divided among the five governments. According to the Revenue Division Year Book 2025, the provisional net total collection of customs duty by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was Rs1.28 trillion in FY25 or 10.9pc of the total tax revenue.\nSimilarly, in the NFC group meeting on the sharing of divisible pool resources for the federally administered tribal districts merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), the KP government has reportedly proposed the creation of a 10-year special grant from the federal divisible pool to address what it described as \u201chistorical development deficits\u201d in the merged area. The grant, officials said, would bring the region on a par with the rest of KP and the country. However, the federal government says the province is getting its due share.\nThe International Monetary Fund projects Pakistan\u2019s provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to rise from 0.9pc in FY25 to 1.6pc by FY28, with total collections expected to exceed Rs3.1tr by FY30. The federal tax revenue is expected to remain largely flat during this period. The Fund says the future revenue growth will be driven mainly by provinces.\nHowever, the Fund notes that this provincial revenue increase is contingent on the successful rollout of agricultural income tax (AIT) reforms and an expanded sales tax on services.Significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, including fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities.\nFormer FBR chairman Syed Shabbar Zaidi says the exemption from the levy of Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act 2011 should be removed, and all retailers and wholesalers should be subjected to taxation under the Act. The jurisdiction of the Federal Sales Tax Act 1990 should end, and registration of such retailers and wholesalers should be transferred to the provinces.\nThe Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) has posted a robust half-yearly growth of 21pc for FY26 by collecting Rs161.4bn compared to Rs133.3bn in FY25. In December, SRB recorded a surge in revenues by 25pc.\nAnd on Dec 9, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had urged the government to transfer the collection of sales tax on goods to the provinces, saying the provinces have proven their capacity to take the lead in collecting the sales tax on services after the 18th Amendment.\nAccording to the Revenue Division Year Book, the total net sales tax collection was provisionally estimated at Rs3.9tr for FY25 or 33.2pc of the federal tax revenue.\nA working group chaired by KP\u2019s Finance Minister will now \u201cdeliberate and suggest measures for improving the overall tax-to-GDP ratio\u201d. Notable here is that the KP Revenue Authority recorded a 30pc increase in collection of sales tax on services amounting to Rs23.3bn during the first six months of this fiscal year compared to Rs17.9bn in the same period last year.\nThe Centre has been levying presumptive taxes on services under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, sales tax on gas, electricity and telephone services and federal excise duty on several services, according to analysts Huzaima Bokhari, Dr Ikramul Haq and Abdul Rauf Shakoori. In a joint Business Recorder article, they wrote that the present situation on the financial front could have been avoided had the centre allowed the provinces to generate their own resources through sales tax on goods.\nDespite the constitutional requirement to allocate 57.5pc of the NFC divisible pool to provinces, Dr Hafiz Pasha said they received only 45.8pc in the last fiscal year. Speaking at a Social Policy and Development Committee seminar on NFC recently, he explained that a nearly 12pc share was withheld either by charging petroleum levy on products that are not part of the divisible pool or by getting back transferred money in the shape of cash surpluses. The federal government collected over Rs1.2tr in petroleum levy, and the provinces also saved Rs921bn as cash surplus.\nAs highlighted in a 2023 World Bank report, the federal government retains ministries linked to devolved subjects and spent Rs328bn on them. A working group will make recommendations on sharing financial expenses incurred by the federation in areas under provincial jurisdiction.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 12th, 2026",

The initiative gained mom\u00adentum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.\nOfficial figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan\u2019s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns for TY2025.\nOf the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns for TY2025, only 43.20pc of those exist on tax rolls with the tax authorities, placing the profession among the least compliant sectors in the tax system.\nMoreover, even among those who filed tax returns, income declarations point to widespread underreporting, raising questions about enforcement, transparency, and the credibility of declared earnings within one of the country\u2019s most established and high earning professions.\nOfficers deputed at private hospitals to monitor revenue and ensure tax compliance\nA senior tax official toldDawnthat the FBR has begun deploying IRS officers directly at the premises of commercial entities, including private hospitals and clinics, to strengthen monitoring and enforcement. According to the official, these officers are tasked with observing the provision of medical services and the collection of receipts in real time.\nIn the first phase, officers have been posted at 50 commercial hospitals under Section175-C of the Income Tax Ordinance. The objective is to identify underreporting of revenues, particularly from high inpatient occupancy charges that, in some cases, exceed the rates charged by five star hotels.\n\u201cWe will identify non-compliant doctors through this exercise,\u201d the official said, adding that private notices are being issued to encourage voluntary compliance. The official noted that voluntary compliance from doctors has already begun following the issuance of these notices.\nThe data place the number of registered doctors on the tax rolls at 130,243, of whom 56,287 filed income tax returns in TY2025, about 43pc of those registered. Among the filers, 48,704 doctors declared income, representing roughly 87pc of those who submitted returns.\nOfficial figures showed that only around two in five registered doctors filed income tax returns in TY2025, with an even smaller share reporting taxable income.\nHowever, 7,583 doctors reported zero income in their tax returns for TY2025.\nFurther analysis of the returns showed that 30,000 doctors of the 48,704 doctors have declared less than Rs2 million annual income, which accounted for 61.59pc of all doctors who declared taxable income in their returns. This percentage goes to 65 percent of total return filers, who declared less than Rs2 million annual income.\nMoreover, most doctors fall in the lower reported income brackets.\nWithin the below Rs2m income bracket, the breakdown of tax returns declarations further highlights the scale of low declared earnings.\nAs many as 341 doctors reported annual income between Re1 and Rs100,000 in their returns, 17,647 doctors declared income ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1m, while 12,959 reported annual earnings between Rs1m and Rs2m for TY2025.\nAccording to data, a sharp decline in the number of doctors as income levels rise. The data show 6,655 doctors fall within the Rs2m to Rs3m annual income bracket, 6,959 doctors are in the Rs3m to Rs5m range, and 3,093 doctors declared annual income between Rs5m and Rs10m.\nAt the highest end of the scale, only 1,050 doctors declared annual income exceeding Rs10m in TY2025.According to the FBR, statistics highlight two gaps, first between registered doctors and those filing their tax returns, and second between filers and the income levels declared with the largest concentration of declarations below Rs2m per year in TY2025.\nPublished in Dawn, December 26th, 2025",

      "fullText": "PAKISTAN\u2019S tax effort appears to have plateaued. Or so the latest IMF projections stress. After a jump of 1.4 percentage points in the tax-to-GDP ratio to 10.3pc in FY25, largely through additional revenue-enhancing measures that mostly burdened captive taxpayers \u2014 the salaried class and compliant businesses \u2014 the FBR tax collection as a ratio of the country\u2019s GDP is projected to stagnate for the next five years. The only modest gains, if any, will likely come from provinces, and that too if they decide to effectively tax agriculture income and services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to jump from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27 and further to 1.6pc in FY28 before flattening until FY30. Overall, the country\u2019s tax revenues are projected to flatten at 11.1pc of GDP \u2014 much below the 13.3pc mark the government has committed to achieve during the current IMF programme period \u2014 all the way through FY30. What the lender is signalling is that the government has \u2018exhausted\u2019 its option to raise taxation without fixing the underlying structural problems and better enforcement, or further burdening compliant sectors of the economy, or both.\nThe government\u2019s growing dependence on non-tax revenue to prop up its fiscal position should be particularly concerning. Though the total government revenues surged to nearly 16pc of GDP in FY25, this increase has not resulted from the expansion of the tax base but from heavy petroleum levy and the State Bank\u2019s profits. The levy has quietly morphed into a permanent quasi-tax on consumption in recent years, disproportionately burdening low-middle-income households. Another worrying fact is that Pakistan\u2019s inequitable tax policy, which is over- reliant on indirect taxes while under-taxing or not taxing certain powerful lobbies, is likely to persist at the expense of economic growth and investment. That Pakistan\u2019s economic growth depends on its ability to boost tax-to-GDP ratio is confirmed by cross-country evidence cited by the Fund: countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc \u2014 precisely where Pakistan has been for a while and appears destined to remain. In sum, faster economic growth will remain a pipe dream until fiscal consolidation is achieved through structural reforms instead of what many call stealth taxation.\nPublished in Dawn, December 24th, 2025",

Addressing the gathering, RCCI President Usman Shaukat stressed that sustainable economic growth is not possible without a fair, predictable, and growth-orientated tax regime.\nHe urged the tax authorities to reduce the excessive burden on existing taxpayers, recognise and acknowledge compliant and high tax-paying businesses, and shift the focus towards broadening the tax base instead of repeatedly taxing the same segment.\nHighlighting the issue of high taxation, President RCCI noted that when super tax and other levies are combined, the corporate tax rate effectively goes beyond 55 per cent, levels more commonly associated with developed economies. He questioned how businesses could remain competitive locally when such high legitimate tax rates are imposed, while better services and facilitation are available abroad at comparatively lower costs.\nHe emphasised that businesses are willing to be tax compliant, provided the system is fair and facilitative.\nHe further suggested non-monetary recognition mechanisms for compliant taxpayers such as recognition cards, priority facilitation at airports, and public acknowledgment stating that such measures do not impose a financial burden on the state but significantly enhance the dignity and motivation of taxpayers.\nThe RCCI president also presented key recommendations, including tax incentives for exporters, reduction in the corporate tax rate, and strong action against corrupt practices and harassment by lower-level staff under the guise of registration, audits, and enforcement, which create uncertainty and discourage voluntary compliance.\nIn her remarks, Chief Commissioner Ms Farhat Qayyum appreciated RCCI\u2019s constructive and pragmatic recommendations for broadening the tax net and sought the Chamber\u2019s continued cooperation in improving tax compliance and revenue collection.\nShe informed the participants that digitization reforms are actively underway to curb malpractices, including digital invoicing and POS system installation, aimed at enhancing transparency and minimizing human intervention.\nThe meeting was attended by Senior Vice President Khalid Farooq Qazi, Vice President Fahad Barlas, former RCCI Presidents Najam Rehan and Asad Mashadi, members of the Executive Committee, representatives of markets and trade associations, various business sectors, and members of the Tax Bar Association.\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2026",

      "fullText": "WITH the constitution of the 11th National FinanceCommission, the debate around revenue sharing takes centre-stage. For years, the federal government has repeated that 57.5 per cent of federal revenues are allocated to provinces, building the narrative that it is cash-strapped. This argument, while politically convenient, is misleading. When one examines the full composition of federal revenues, it becomes evident that the federal government retains close to 60pc of total revenues. A growing share of this is collected outside the NFC\u2019s divisible pool, particularly through the petroleumlevy.\nWhile politically expedient, relying on the petroleum levy and other surcharges as non-shareable revenue is deeply problematic. It bypasses the constitutional principles of the NFC, weakens the mechanism designed to ensure fair federal-provincial fiscal relations, and concentrates fiscal discretion in the hands of the federal executive. By creating a parallel pool of revenues untied to the NFC formula, the centre undermines transparency, and erodes trust in federalism. The narrative that provinces are draining the centre\u2019s resources is false and distracts from structural issues in federal finances.\nAnother persistent fallacy is the proposal that provincial transfers should be tied to performance, often implying that the centre should oversee provincial outcomes. At first glance, such arguments may seem reasonable: if resources are allocated, accountability appears justified. However, this line of reasoningmisunderstandsPakistan\u2019s fiscal federalism. The NFC was designed solely as a mechanism for revenue sharing, not as a supervisory instrument. Provinces have constitutionally defined responsibilities, strengthened by the 18th Amendment, and conditioning transfers on federal assessment risks violating the spirit of federalism.\nMoreover, if performance were to determine transfers, the principle must apply equally to the federal government, whose own failures in tax collection, exchange rate management, and debt administration directly shape the fiscal environment in which provinces operate. One-sided accountability, where provinces are scrutinised while the centre is shielded, reflects political expediency more than economic prudence.\nA permanent technical NFC will ensure debates are grounded in evidence rather than slogans.\nEqually misleading is the claim that the seventh NFC Award is responsible for the federal government\u2019s growing debt. Pakistan\u2019s debt problem arises primarily from structural weaknesses and policy failures at the federal level. Two critical areas bear particular responsibility. First, the government\u2019s exchange rate management has been erratic and often counterproductive. Persistent overvaluation in some periods, followed by sharp devaluations, has generated uncertainty, inflated the local currency value of foreign-denominated debt, and contributed to high inflation.\nSecond, Pakistan\u2019s tax policies have consistently failed to raise revenue to sustainable levels. The federal tax-to-GDP ratio remains among the lowest in the region, reflecting poor base coverage, excessive exemptions, and weak enforcement. Together, these two policy failures, poor exchange rate management and inadequate taxation, have driven deficits, forced borrowing, and worsened debt sustainability. Misattributing debt accumulation to provincial transfers allows the federal government to avoid the reforms required to stabilise public finances, including rationalising expenditure, improving state-owned enterprises\u2019 efficiency, and reforming pensions.\nRecognising these fallacies is the first step towards reform. What Pakistan urgently needs is a permanent, technically grounded NFC as a foundational layer of the NFC architecture. Currently, the NFC primarily functions as a political negotiation every five years, producing headline-grabbing percentages without rigorous analysis. A standing body of economists and fiscal experts could provide transparent, evidence-based recommendations, track revenue distribution across tiers, model alternative formulas for divisible and non-divisible pools, and ensure transfers reflect a changing development landscape.\nInstitutionalising technical expertise would transform NFC negotiations from episodic political contests into disciplined, data-driven policymaking, prevent politically motivated distortions, ensure transparency, and build trust between the centre and provinces.\nAlongside a permanent NFC, Pakistan must also deepen tax devolution to provinces and cities, but both the federal and provincial governments share responsibility for current weaknesses. While the federal government has centralised tax collection, leaving provinces with limited authority, provincial governments have often blocked local government systems and resisted meaningful devolution. This mutual reluctance has created a cycle in which provinces remain dependent on federal transfers, cities are underfunded, and citizens see limited accountability.\nStrengthening subnational fiscal capacity requires reform at both levels: granting provinces and cities meaningful tax powers, including property taxes, and unified sales taxes, while modernising revenue administrations through digitalisation and analytics. Linking local revenue mobilisation to service delivery would ensure that fiscal authority is matched with citizen expectations and that local governments can become viable instruments of governance.\nTaken together, these reforms address both the misconceptions surrounding NFC distribution and the structural realities of Pakistan\u2019s fiscal landscape. Clarifying the true share of revenues corrects the false narrative of provincial generosity undermining the centre. Instituting a permanent technical NFC ensures debates are grounded in evidence rather than slogans. Expanding tax authority to provinces and cities strengthens fiscal capacity, enhances accountability, and improves service delivery. Each of these steps contributes to a balanced federal system, where resources are aligned with responsibilities and all tiers of government are incentivised to perform efficiently.\nAddressing Pakistan\u2019s fiscal challenges requires more than debates over numbers or blame-shifting. Policymakers must commit to long-term reforms that strengthen institutional capacity, enforce fiscal discipline, and create incentives for all tiers of government to raise and manage resources effectively. By embedding technical rigour into revenue-sharing mechanisms and empowering lower tiers of governments to mobilise and utilise resources efficiently, Pakistan can build a more resilient fiscal architecture. Only through consistent, evidence-based policymaking and cooperative governance can the country ensure that public funds translate into tangible services, economic growth, and trust in federalism for the citizens it serves.\nThe writer is an associate professor of economics at the Lahore School of Economics.\nX:@waqarwadho\nPublished in Dawn, January 14th, 2026",

The levy was introduced by the PML-N government as a one-time measure, aimed at rebuilding areas devastated by the military operation. The super tax applies to wealthy individuals, associations of persons and companies earning over Rs500 million. It imposes a tax rate of 4pc on banking companies and 3pc on other sectors to fund the rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons.\nDuring the hearing, the AAG cited the 1991 Sohail Jute Ltd case, in which the levy of Iqra surcharge and customs duty was challenged.\nHe argued that the Supreme Court had held that mere nomenclature could not determine the vires of a levy. If, in pith and substance, the levy was a customs duty, it would remain so regardless of being labelled as an Iqra surcharge, he contended.\nThe opposing side maintained that since the super tax was imposed for the specific purpose of rehabilitating displaced persons, it could not be treated as a general tax and, therefore, did not qualify as a tax.\nSenior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan questioned the authority of the Inland Revenue Commissioner to approach the FCC in a case relating to the super tax.\n\u201cWhen the federal government as well as the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were not aggrieved by the judgements of the high courts, how could the Commissioner of Inland Revenue name both as respondents in the case?\u201d he argued.\nHe further questioned how the commissioner could sue the federal government when it was not an appellant before the FCC despite having enacted the statute in question, remarking that the situation was akin to \u201cthe tail wagging the dog\u201d.\nMr Khan contended that while passing the law, the legislature had recognised that the commissioner, on its own, did not have the right to file such appeals before the FCC.\nAdvocate Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar, representing the FBR, argued that taxation was a matter of legislative policy beyond judicial discretion. He said respecting parliamentary supremacy and exercising judicial restraint in fiscal matters were essential to uphold the rule of law and national fiscal sovereignty.\nHe urged the court to uphold the validity of Section 4C of ITO as a lawful and constitutionally sanctioned levy, consistent with Article 25 and international fiscal practice, and said there was no discrimination as alleged by taxpayers.\nHe also requested that the high courts\u2019 judgements, which he said attempted to dilute or rewrite parliament\u2019s express mandate, be set aside, reiterating that taxation was a matter of legislative policy beyond judicial discretion.\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2026",

      "fullText": "LAHORE: Pakistan\u2019s rice exports recorded a strong rebound in December 2025, registering a 14 per cent month-on-month (MoM) increase compared to November, primarily driven by a more than 50pc surge in Basmati shipments.\nThe impressive performance enabled Pakistan to overtake Vietnam and emerge as the world\u2019s third-largest rice exporter, behind India and Thailand, during the month.\nAccording to trade data, Pakistan exported 489,000 tonnes of rice in December 2025, excluding shipments to Iran, compared to Vietnam\u2019s 387,000 tonnes. This marks Pakistan\u2019s best monthly rice export performance, underscoring renewed momentum in the sector.\nThe UAE remained the top destination for Pakistani rice, importing 74,897 tonnes, including 16,850 tonnes of Basmati. China followed closely with 74,685 tonnes, while other major destinations included Tanzania (62,900 tonnes), Kenya (60,300 tonnes), Ivory Coast (41,700 tonnes), Guinea-Bissau (31,850 tonnes), Malaysia (23,930 tonnes), Madagascar (17,800 tonnes), Kazakhstan (17,050 tonnes), Saudi Arabia (16,032 tonnes, including 5,350 tonnes of Basmati), the EU and UK combined (21,100 tonnes, including 15,600 tonnes of Basmati), Oman (5,770 tonnes), the United States (2,230 tonnes), and Canada (1,321 tonnes).\nDecember surge boosts rankings despite structural challenges\nA notable development during December was Pakistan\u2019s growing footprint in Central Asian markets. Exports to Kazakhstan exceeded 17,000 tonnes, including 10,300 tonnes of Basmati, while shipments to Uzbekistan stood at 10,382 tonnes. Industry experts say this reflects a structural shift, as Pakistan is now exporting directly to Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Previously, much of this trade moved indirectly through Afghanistan, but the closure of the Afghan border has prompted direct export routes, making Pakistan\u2019s presence in the region more visible.\nDespite the encouraging December figures, the rice export sector continues to face deep-rooted challenges. Structural, financial, marketing, and capacity-related weaknesses persist, with one of the most significant gaps being Pakistan\u2019s negligible exports to Iraq \u2014 currently the world\u2019s second-largest importer of Indian Basmati rice after Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Pakistan\u2019s exports to Turkiye, a key transit hub for Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and parts of Eastern Europe, remain minimal.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has recently directed authorities to formulate a comprehensive strategy to boost rice exports and reduce the widening trade deficit.\nGovernment officials have attributed the downturn to low-priced Indian rice and phytosanitary rejections at borders. However, exporters argue that Pakistan\u2019s rice sector is suffering primarily due to policy missteps.\nHamid Malik, a rice sector analyst, says the causes include intense global competition, higher global production \u2014 especially in India \u2014 weakening international demand, rising ocean freight and logistics costs, inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, irrational regulatory frameworks, inflated domestic prices caused by hoarding and undocumented money, and security-related border closures.\nAmid these challenges, Malik sees several positive developments as a silver lining. \u201cThere is strong demand for Pakistani rice in Bangladesh, although higher freight costs have eroded competitiveness.\u201d\nCentral Asian states are also emerging as promising markets since the start of Pakistan\u2019s harvesting season in October 2025. Additionally, a 50pc tariff imposed by the United States on Indian rice exports has begun to benefit Pakistan, with shipments to the US gradually picking up, says Abu Bakr, an exporter.\nAnother significant development is unfolding in Iran, where foreign exchange shortages have led the Iranian Central Bank to stop issuing subsidised foreign exchange for rice imports. Iranian traders are now importing rice using their own funds, a shift that has favoured Pakistan due to geographic proximity. Pakistani exporters report a surge in Iranian demand, while Indian exporters have been adversely affected.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Despite over 35 years of \u2018reforms\u2019 and policy interventions, Pakistan\u2019s power sector remains incapable of instilling confidence in the country\u2019s economic growth and in consumers\u2019 trust, leading to gains secured from power producers through renegotiations evaporating amid unending inefficiencies.\nThis charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship \u2018State of the Industry Report 2025\u2019, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.\nIt said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.\nIt said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, \u201coverall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development\u201d.\nNepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt\nIt pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).\nOn the distribution side, many go\u00ad\u00advernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com\u00adme\u00adrcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie\u00adncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con\u00adtribute to the circular debt problem.\nIt said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. \u201cPersistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector\u2019s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth\u201d, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector\u2019s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.\nThe regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.\nIt appreciated the government\u2019s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. \u201cConsequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs\u2019 tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms\u201d.\nOn top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal.\nReduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.\nA notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.\nThe regulator put on record that \u201cKE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.\nIt said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.\nAs if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator\u2019s monitoring and enforcement drive had \u201cbeen diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions\u201d. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator\u2019s monitoring and enforcement efforts.\nPublished in Dawn, January 17th, 2026",

      "fullText": "NEPRA\u2019S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.\nIn fact, the power sector\u2019s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector\u2019s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector\u2019s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator\u2019s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

Before this drop, prices had increased by 4.4pc during October and November.\nKarachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, reported distribution-stage system losses of 12.55pc, up from 10.6pc a couple of months earlier. Meanwhile, Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), supplying gas to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported system losses of nearly 9pc at the distribution stage, compared to 7.47pc in October.\nAccording to the notification, the RLNG sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage declined by 4.62pc to $10.41 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for January 2026, from $10.92 per mmBtu in December 2025 and $11.24 in September.\nAs a result, the sale price at the distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 4.68pc to $11.27 per mmBtu for January, compared to $11.83 in December and $12.24 in November.\nOn the other hand, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL at the transmission stage decreased by 5.25pc to $8.98 per mmBtu for January, from $9.47 in December, $10.065 in November and $9.86 in September.\nThe distribution-stage sale price for SSGCL was also reduced by 5.26pc to $10.21 per mmBtu for the current month, compared to $10.77 in December, $11.45 in November and $11.01 in September.\nOgra said the reduction in RLNG prices was due to a decrease in the delivered ex-ship (DES) price.

He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.\nThis resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.\nThe minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.\nHe said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.\nMr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps \u2014 both low recoveries and high losses \u2014 were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers\u2019 money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.\nThe minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.\nHe said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.\nHe agreed with the Nepra\u2019s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under \u2018take or pay\u2019 or \u2018must run\u2019 agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.\n\u2018Without due diligence\u2019\nResponding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.\n\u201cWe have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan\u2019s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,\u201d he said.\nThe minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.\nHe also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. \u201cIn the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,\u201d he said.\nHe also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was \u2018a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos\u2019. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.\nHe said the Discos\u2019 recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.\nCircular debt\nContesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator\u2019s \u201cunderstanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising\u201d.\nHe said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.\nMost importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. \u201cK-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric\u2019s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.\nThe receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,\u201d the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.\nResponding to Nepra\u2019s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

      "fullText": "\u2022 Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months\u2022 Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector\nISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).\nWhile testifying before the National Assembly\u2019s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr\u00ado\u00adleum Minister Ali Per\u00advaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.\nThe minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.\nInterestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared topetrol and dieselwhich are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.\nIn the last week of November 2025, Ogra haddeterminedup to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra\u2019s determination within 40 days.\nThe minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan hadconcludedsuccessful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac\u00adh\u00aded to manage excess supplies.\nMNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector\u2019s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.\nThe minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been \u201cquelled\u201d, which was a critical reform measure.\nSui gas companies\u2019 managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.\nThe Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.\nCommittee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.\nOfficials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.\nNo domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.\nThe committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.\nThe minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.\nThe committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2026",

The Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran\u2019s economic problems. Inflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Iran\u2019s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. Total exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, according to the IMF. Iran's economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown. GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022. By 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 suggest a near-stagnant rate of 0.3pc to 0.6pc.",
      "fullText": "Iran\u2019s economy is going through one of its most difficult periods in years, fueled by sanctions, high inflation, and a significant drop in the value of the national currency, the rial.\nThese pressures have had a direct impact on living standards and have also fueled recent protests.\nThe protests began on Dec. 28 in commercial hubs in the capital Tehran, when shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners staged strikes and demonstrations to protest soaring inflation, the collapsing rial, and deteriorating economic conditions, and have since grown into nationwide anti-government expressions of discontent involving workers, students, and others across multiple cities.\nThe Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran\u2019s economic problems amid the protests. Masoud Pezeshkian said the government admits to \u201cshortcomings and problems\u201d and is working hard to alleviate the people\u2019s concerns, especially on the economy.\nThe Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. It started last year at around 817,000 rials per $1, then sank to 1.42-1.47 million rials on the parallel market by late 2025.\nDue to the rial\u2019s sharp decline, most Iranians have struggled to keep up with steadily rising prices.\nThe currency has been suffering for years in the face of sanctions and inflationary pressures, going from about 34,000 rials to the US dollar in 2016 to around 270,000 in 2021 and some 430,000 in 2022.\nBy 2023-2024, the rial had crossed the 750,000 mark on the open market, and its depreciation accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the rial has lost nearly 800 per cent of its value, and as of this week, it trades at around 1.5 million rials to the dollar, severely eroding household purchasing power.\nAs the rial weakened, import costs shot up, feeding inflation and forcing businesses to raise prices. For ordinary Iranians, the falling currency has wiped out savings, reduced purchasing power, and created fear that prices will continue rising.\nTraders and shopkeepers have been among the first to protest, as they struggle to afford goods amid daily currency swings.\nInflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Middle- and lower-income families are increasingly forced to cut back on basic goods.\nConsumer price inflation remains exceptionally high, with inflation estimated at 30.6pc in 2020 before rising sharply to 43.4pc in 2021 and staying elevated at around 44pc\u201346pc in both 2022 and 2023.\nAlthough inflation eased to about 32.5pc in 2024, it is projected to accelerate again, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting inflation of 42.4pc in 2025 and remaining above 40pc in 2026, underscoring the persistence of price pressures driven by currency weakness and structural constraints.\nFood costs and staples have grown much faster, with sectoral inflation (such as bread and fruit) substantially outpacing the national rate.\nThe Statistical Centre of Iran reported that food inflation last September reached 58pc, more than double the rate in the same month the previous year. According to the survey, fruit costs have soared 75pc while bread and grains, which are staples in Iranian households, have almost doubled in price.\nAlthough the government provides cash handouts and subsidies, including monthly payments, and food staple, electricity, and foreign exchange subsidies, these measures have not offset the impact of rising prices, especially as the value of payments declines alongside the rial.\nIran\u2019s economy is still severely hampered by international sanctions. US sanctions limit access to the international financial system, banking transactions, and oil exports. Even when Iran is successful in exporting oil, access to hard currency is often restricted, delayed, or held overseas.\nAccording to aReuterssurvey, Iran\u2019s oil output fell by 100,000 barrels per day in late 2025 due to the sanctions, which directly cut into government revenue.\nTotal exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, while imports are expected to fall by roughly 10pc to $98bn, according to the IMF, reflecting tighter foreign exchange and sanctions pressure.\nIn 2025, the IMF projected a 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) decline in both output and exports as of last May. A greater decline of up to half a million bpd has been projected by independent energy analytics companies, including Kpler, Vortexa, and TankerTrackers.\nAs a result, foreign exchange inflows have fallen, and the Central Bank\u2019s capacity to maintain currency stability has been eroded. Additionally, sanctions have hindered trade and discouraged foreign investment, pushing Iran to rely on unofficial routes that raise prices and decrease transparency.\nIran\u2019s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. In the fiscal year that ended last March, Iran\u2019s Central Bank estimated oil revenues of $67bn. The bank reported oil revenues of $56bn for fiscal 2024, $55bn for 2023, $38bn for 2022, and $23bn for 2021.\nHowever, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the export figures vary. In the calendar year 2018, when the first Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran, oil revenues reached $51bn, according to the EIA. In 2020, they sank to $5bn, before rebounding to $43bn in 2024.\nIran\u2019s fiscal position remains under strain, with the government running persistent budget deficits amid constrained revenues and rising spending pressures.\nAccording to IMF-based estimates, the budget deficit stood at around 4.1pc of GDP in 2024 and is expected to widen to about 6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, before remaining elevated at roughly 6.2pc of GDP in 2026. The deterioration reflects limited oil revenue recovery under sanctions, weak non-oil tax collection, and higher outlays on subsidies, wages, and social support, adding to inflationary and currency pressures.\nIn its most recent budget, the government estimated daily oil shipments of 1.85 million barrels per day at $67 per barrel. However, the IMF projected that actual exports would only average 1.1 million barrels per day, showing a significant deficit.\nOver the last five years, Iran\u2019s economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown.\nAfter a period of lost growth in the late 2010s, GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022, largely driven by a recovery in oil exports and domestic services following the pandemic. This momentum peaked in 2023 with a 5.3pc expansion, but the trajectory has since cooled considerably.\nBy 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 from the IMF and the World Bank suggest a near-stagnant rate of just 0.3pc to 0.6pc. This recent deceleration is attributed to intensified sanctions, chronic inflation (averaging near 40pc), and severe energy shortages that have hampered industrial productivity.\nWhile the oil sector remains a primary driver of the nominal economy \u2014 which fluctuated between $350bn and $475bn \u2014 non-oil sectors continue to struggle under structural constraints and a weakening currency.\nIn addition, the labour market over the last five years has been characterised by a jobless recovery followed by a tightening market amid recent economic stagnation. Official figures showed the total unemployment rate declining from 9.3pc in 2021 to a record low of approximately 7.2pc to 8.2pc by late 2024.\nYouth unemployment remains a critical challenge, consistently hovering between 20pc and 23pc, nearly triple the national average.\nHeader image: Photo showing protesters taking to the streets in Tehran as police personnel stand atop a vehicle. \u2014 Anadolu Agency",

May God give them more life.\u201d\nAccording to a list shared withDawnaround the same time, the South district office had received reports of 53 missing people from their families so far.\nThe Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.\nA separate statement by the South Zone police also listed the following helpline contact numbers: 021-99205670, 021-99201196 and 021-99205691.\nHundreds of people had gathered around the building today, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.\nDuring his media talk, CM Murad noted that the mall was a three-storey building with a basement and housed more than 1,000 shops.\nWhile the chief minister noted that the cause of the fire could not be ascertained for sure at this stage, he said a short circuit was being blamed for igniting the blaze in a shop with flammable material.\nTerming it a \u201cvery upsetting\u201d incident, he stressed that authorities were making efforts to find missing people.\nThe Sindh CM detailed that around 26 fire tenders, 10 bowsers and multiple snorkels took part in the fire extinguishing operations.\nCM Murad, citing what he had been informed, said an alert about the fire was received at 10:16pm, and the first fire tender had reached the site at 10:27pm.\n\u201cAll municipal authorities acted immediately, according to what I have been informed, and all these things will be verified.\u201d\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday spoke CM Murad over the telephone to inquire about the latest situation of the fire, stressing the need to use all available resources to ensure the success of rescue and firefighting operations, a statement from the President\u2019s House said.\n\u201cThe president also paid tribute to firefighter Farqan Shaukat, who lost his life in the blaze, and asked the Sindh government to nominate him for a civil award.\u201d\nHe directed authorities to ensure proper medical care for the injured and take immediate steps for the rehabilitation of affected families, while emphasising strict enforcement of fire safety laws and the modernisation of safety inspection mechanisms in commercial and residential buildings to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nA statement from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said PM Shehbaz Sharif also inquired about the incident over the phone, offering all kinds of assistance to the provincial government from the Centre.\nPointing out that the mall was constructed in the 1980s, he said, \u201cI admit that we could not control the deterioration that, without any study, multi-level buildings were allowed. And now if we stop them, the builders make a fuss that they are being bothered.\u201d\nHe highlighted that many buildings do not have materials to extinguish fire available inside the buildings, and stressed the need for fire exits to be properly marked.\nAt around 4pm, South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso toldDawnthat the fire had been brought under control by up to 70pc.\nSpeaking toGeo News, DC Khoso said authorities were gathering information about the number of people trapped inside the building.\n\u201cWe have cordoned off the area and are trying to extinguish the blazes phase-wise,\u201d he said.\nRescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Abid Jalal toldGeo Newsin the afternoon that \u201cfirefighting is underway from all three sides\u201d.\nHe also said that the fire had been brought under control by about 70-75pc.

This should be compensated immediately.\u201d\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz expressed their deep grief over the fire at Gul Plaza and the resulting loss of lives.\nIn a statement reported byAPP, the premier instructed that all possible assistance should be provided to the affected traders and other individuals, and that all necessary facilities should be provided to the injured.\nHe stressed that all relevant departments should work together in the rescue operation.\nIn his statement, President Zardari directed that the Sindh government \u2014 which is of his PPP \u2014 and the relevant authorities \u201cprovide immediate and every possible assistance to the affected people and the traders\u201d.\n\u201cNo stone should be left unturned in providing the best medical facilities to the injured,\u201d the statement quoted him as saying.\nMemon, in a statement reported byAPP, said the Sindh government will decide the future course of action after a complete assessment of the losses.\nThe minister said that whether it is the trader community or other affected individuals, the government will make every effort to provide maximum possible assistance within the framework of law and regulations.\nTaking notice of the incident, CM Murad issued orders to Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi for an immediate inquiry into the matter and to prepare a report on the cause of the fire.\nCM Murad was briefed about the incident earlier in the day at the CM House by Commissioner Naqvi and DC Khoso, who informed him that the fire broke out between 9:45pm and 10:15pm.\n\u201cThe fire safety arrangements in the building should be inspected,\u201d CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement.\nHe ordered the strict implementation of fire safety rules and action against those whose negligence or carelessness would be proven.\n\u201cA fire safety audit should immediately be conducted of Karachi\u2019s commercial buildings,\u201d CM Murad said.\nAccording to the briefing, more than 1,200 shops were gutted in the incident. A massive emergency response was launched, involving 22 fire brigade vehicles, 10 water bowzers, four snorkel vehicles, and 33 Rescue 1122 ambulances.\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed CM Murad and Wahab to deploy all resources to control the fire.\nExpressing grief over the loss of lives and property, he demanded an immediate probe into the blaze and ordered that steps be taken to prevent such future tragedies.\nSindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah visited the site of the incident earlier in the day to assess the rescue operations.\nThe South deputy commissioner and Rescue 1122 officials briefed him on the steps taken to control the fire.\nThe chief secretary issued orders for the deployment of all available fire tenders and additional rescue workers.\nSoon after the fire began, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had also visited Gul Plaza, where he was briefed on the rescue and relief operations.\nStanding alongside the traders whose shops were ablaze, the governor issued directives for the rehabilitation of the affected.\nPrior to his visit, in a statement from his office, Tessori expressed concern over the incident and ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations.\nHe also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.\nGul Plaza has witnessed fire incidents in the past as well.\nInAugust 2016, more than 25 shops were burnt in a huge fire that broke out in the multi-storey market. It was believed that a short circuit caused the fire.\nA fire at a warehouse in Gul Plaza inAugust 2008, also caused by an electric short-circuit, destroyed some goods. However, no casualty was reported.\nFires frequentlyeruptin buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.\nAt a conference in October 2025 followingmultiplefireincidents, city planners, fire experts and disaster management authorities raisedserious concernsover the deteriorating state of fire preparedness in Karachi.\nThey urged authorities to take immediate action to align the metropolis\u2019s fire safety systems with international standards, warning that the current state leaves the city dangerously exposed to large-scale emergencies.\nIn December, the Sindh Assemblyvoted unanimouslyin favour of an opposition-sponsored resolution that called for the comprehensive modernisation of Karachi\u2019s inadequate and substandard firefighting system.\nAdditional input from Reuters",

      "fullText": "ABOUT 14,400 years ago, a weeks-old wolf puppy ate its last meal \u2014 meat from a woolly rhinoceros \u2014 shortly before dying on the harsh Ice Age landscape of northeastern Siberia.\nIn a first, researchers have extracted DNA and recovered the rhino\u2019s genome from a chunk of undigested meat from the stomach contents found in the puppy\u2019s remains, discovered in permafrost near the village of Tumat. These genome findings provided insight into the fate of this impressive cold-adapted horned herbivore species once common in northern Europe and Asia.\nThe researchers compared this rhino\u2019s genome to those of two other individuals from the same species that lived thousands of years earlier \u2014 about 18,000 and 49,000 years ago \u2014 to examine genetic changes over time. In doing so, they learned that the woolly rhinoceros as a species remained genetically healthy until the end of the Ice Age before apparently suffering a rapid population collapse, probably because the warming climate erased their preferred steppe-tundra environment.\nFor instance, the newly recovered genome showed no evidence of inbreeding suggestive of population decline. Other research has indicated that the woolly rhinoceros disappeared about 14,000 years ago, just a few hundred years after this individual lived.\n\u201cWith this research we demonstrate that it is possible to recover a high-quality genome from poorly preserved material dating to a crucial time in the life history of a species,\u201d said evolutionary geneticist Solveig Gudjonsdottir, lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution.\n\u201cIt is a very cool achievement,\u201d said evolutionary geneticist and study co-senior author Love Daln of the Centre for Palaeogenetics, a collaboration between Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The woolly rhinoceros, whose species name is Coelodonta antiquitatis, first appears in the fossil record about 600,000 years ago.\nIt became one of the many large mammals to go extinct around the end of the last Ice Age, along with such species as woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, mastodons and giant ground sloths, all of which faced ominous environmental changes as the climate warmed, as well as pressure from human hunting.\n\u201cThe woolly rhinoceros was a large animal, reaching up to around 2 meters (7 feet) tall, and was covered in thick, long fur,\u201d said Gudjonsdottir, who worked on the study while a master\u2019s student at Stockholm University. \u201cIt had two horns, a large hump on its back, a stocky build and relatively short legs. The species was primarily a grazer, feeding on grass and low vegetation adapted to cold, dry environments,\u201d Gudjonsdottir added.\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

      "fullText": "MADRID: Real Madrid ended a turbulent week with a much-needed 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Levante on Saturday, courtesy of second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio, after being met with boos from a restless Bernabeu crowd before the breakthrough arrived.\nThe win snapped Real\u2019s two-match losing run and offered brief respite after a bruising week. They looked flat in the first half, still carrying the scars of Sunday\u2019s 3-2 Spanish Super Cup final defeat to rivals Barcelona, followed by the departure of manager Xabi Alonso the next day and a shock 3-2 Copa del Rey exit to second-division Albacete on Wednesday.\nBoos greeted the players at kick-off, with sections of the crowd also directing chants at club president Florentino Perez. Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week.\nReal finally eased the tension when Adrian de la Fuente tripped Mbappe in the box, and the French forward, was spared the jeers, converted the penalty in the 58th minute to extend his league-leading tally to 19 goals.\nMbappe, who appeared in pain in the warm up after a collision with team-mate Dean Huijsen, had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.\nSeven minutes later, Real doubled their advantage through centre-back Asencio, who rose to meet Arda Guler\u2019s corner with a powerful header to make it 2-0 in the 65th minute, giving new coach Alvaro Arbeloa a crucial cushion and settling the mood inside the stadium.\n\u201cToday was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,\u201d Asencio told Real Madrid TV. \u201cWhat happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better. The team gave a good account of themselves, above all in the second half. He [Arbeloa] asks us to enjoy ourselves -- to be protagonists, to  dominate, to focus on ourselves and not on the opposition. Little by  little, we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\nThe win keeps Real second in La Liga on 48 points from 20 matches, one behind leaders Barcelona, who have a game in hand and visit Real Sociedad on Sunday.

He has started skipping lunch unless a client is generous enough to give him lunch. Iqbal's monthly expenses continue to be higher than his income. He has accumulated a significant amount of debt, which there is little possibility of paying. The state does not provide good healthcare facilities.

      "fullText": "IQBAL works as a driver with a rent-a-car company. He is usually working six to seven days a week. The company pays him around Rs30,000 as salary. He does make some more as overtime, and though that amount varies by the month, on average he gets another Rs20,000 or so. Adding tips to the total, he makes around Rs65,000 per month. He has a wife and two children who are still in school.\nUp to a couple of years ago, Iqbal was able to save a bit every month from his income. But the inflation over the last few years has made his budget a lot more constrained. He is barely able to meet all his routine expenses now. Electricity and gas bills have increased a lot. And the food bill has also almost doubled. He is actively on the lookout for extra driving jobs now so that he can get more overtime payment. He has started skipping lunch unless a client is generous enough to give him lunch or money for lunch.\nThis is not an isolated case. In their article (\u2018People are eating less\u2019) in this paper last week, Zafar Mirza and Miftah Ismail, giving numbers from the Household Integrated Expenditure Survey 2024-25, have shown that people are indeed eating less and they have had to tighten their belts further to make ends meet. And this is true for not just lower-income groups but middle-income groups as well.\nWhat has made life a lot harder for Iqbal and his family has been a health shock. His wife has blood pressure and diabetes and has recently been diagnosed with some liver ailment. Doctor\u2019s fee, expenses for diagnostic testing and regular costs of medicines have pushed Iqbal into debt. He has been forced to borrow from his relatives, friends and any clients he felt would be kind enough to help him or lend him money.\nWe need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generation opportunities.\nEach month is a struggle now. Medical expenses are a constant addition to his monthly expenses, but his income has not gone up and there does not seem to be any prospect of income growth either. He has essentially fallen into a debt trap. He has accumulated a significant amount of debt, which there is little possibility of paying, and has no ability to raise further debt. But monthly expenses continue to be higher than his income.\nWhat is a person like Iqbal supposed to do?\nThis is not the story of just one household in Pakistan. It is the story of a significant proportion of the population of the country. If people have no savings, shocks can be devastating and can push households into debt and poverty. The most common shock seems to be health shocks. For a household of five to six people \u2014 the norm in Pakistan \u2014 with one or two earners, and with grandparents and children, health shocks are not a surprise at all.\nDiabetes, blood pressure, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and many other ailments \u2014 a lot of them requiring medium- to long-term and continued care \u2014 are quite common in Pakistan. With 40 per cent or so of children afflicted with malnutrition, youngsters falling ill is not unexpected either.\nThe state does not provide good healthcare facilities. Public sector provision is not only patchy and of poor quality in general, it is also not available everywhere. And private healthcare is expensive. Whenever Iqbal has taken his wife to the public hospital, he has been told to get diagnostic tests done from private laboratories and he has also had to pay for all the medicines. Only the doctor\u2019s fee is subsidised by the state. But diagnostic tests are quite expensive. Medicines, too, are expensive and have become even more costly over the last few years.\nDo bear in mind that we do not provide any income support through our social protection institutions and programmes to those who are above very low-income levels. The Benazir Income Support Programme is for the very poor and does not extend beyond. There are no programmes for the working or low-income poor.\nWhat could be the way out for Iqbal? Can he increase his income? He could try to work more hours. That is not easy though. He could pull out one or more of his children from school and push them into the workforce. But given the unemployment rates in the country, this is not much of an option, especially if the children are still in the early to middle stages of their education. And the loss in terms of a child not completing his or her education is seen in the medium- to long-term damage to the country.\nIt is at the level of the state that we can actually change things. In fact, it is the responsibility of the state to do so. A large proportion of Pakistanis have fallen on hard times, even a larger proportion has become more vulnerable to shocks than before. It is the responsibility of the state to do something about this. It is here, even in terms of intentions, that we do not find anything. We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generating opportunities for people. And we need to think about extending support to those who are falling on hard times. Probably the best way to do this \u2014 and this is being done and has been done in many countries \u2014 is to extend health and education facilities of decent quality to all citizens, especially those who are struggling. This could help a lot of people in major ways. But, of course, in an elitist and elite-captured state, this will not happen easily. It will require a major overhaul of the governance system and governance ethos in the country. This, at least for now, does not seem to be on the horizon.\nThe writer is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives and an associate professor of economics at Lums.\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2026",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: Pakistan posted a current account deficit (CAD) of $1.174 billion during the first half of 2025-26 compared with a surplus of $957 million in the same period last year, the State Bank said on Monday.\nThe government has projected a CAD of around $2.1bn, or within 0-1 per cent of GDP, for FY26, anticipating higher imports driven by economic growth.\nExperts believe the changing geopolitical situation could disrupt oil prices, putting pressure on Pakistan\u2019s balance of payments as the country relies entirely on imported oil. They warn that any renewed conflict in the Middle East, such as an attack on Iran, could suddenly affect supply chains and push oil prices higher. Rising oil prices would further worsen the country\u2019s current account imbalance.\nThe State Bank and the government believe that higher imports contribute to the current account deficit, with oil accounting for the largest share of imports. In FY25, the country spent $15bn on petroleum product imports out of total imports of $59bn. Despite these imports, the current account recorded a surplus of $2bn.\nSwelling trade deficit driven by higher imports turns current account red\nOn Monday, international crude oil prices ranged between $59 and $63 per barrel and remained volatile amid fears of a possible attack on Iran.\nAccording to the SBP data, the current account posted a surplus of $98 million in November, but turned into a deficit of $244m in December. Both quarters of the current fiscal year recorded deficits: $737m during July-September and $437m during October-December.\nAlthough the State Bank\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have improved during the current financial year, they remain insufficient to cover petroleum imports for the entire year. During the first half of FY26, the country spent $7.1bn on petroleum product imports, compared to $7.3bn in the same period of FY25.\nThe government has set an export target of $60bn over three years, but exports depend 35 to 40pc on imported inputs. Weak manufacturing activity and declining cotton production have increased the import bill. Pakistan imported cotton worth $2.3bn in FY25, and production has declined again this year, indicating that more dollars will be required to boost exports. The textile sector remains the largest source of export earnings.\nThe current account surplus in FY25 helped stabilise market sentiment and the exchange rate, preventing panic in the dollar market.\nThe trade deficit widened from $14.5bn to $19.2bn in the first half of FY26, sending a clear signal about future trends. Apart from concerns over higher oil prices, the import bill is expected to continue rising as low GDP growth has increased pressure on the government. The government has been held responsible over the past three years for low GDP growth, which has pushed about 46pc of the population below the poverty line.\nPublished in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed.\nIt further said that high and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation.",

That makes no sense,\u201d Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, toldAFP.\nAround 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September.\nTEPCO said on Wednesday it would \u201cproceed with careful verification of each plant facility\u2019s integrity\u201d and address any issues appropriately and transparently.\nKashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world\u2019s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.\nThe facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.\nHowever, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source.\nFourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January.\nKashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.\nNearly 15 years after the disaster, \u201cthe situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that\u2019s absolutely unacceptable\u201d, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator.\nThe vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades.\nHowever, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,\u201d Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, toldAFP.\nOn January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority.\nThe petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,\u201d it said.\n\u201cMaking many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo \u2026 is intolerable.\u201d Before the 2011 disaster \u2014 which killed around 18,000 people \u2014 nuclear power generated about a third of Japan\u2019s electricity.\nJapan\u2019s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks.\nAt Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test.\n\u201cSafety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,\u201d TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with theAsahidaily newspaper.\nJapan is the world\u2019s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.\nNearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil \u2014 a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power.\nUnder a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan\u2019s energy supply by 2040 \u2014 up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24.\nMeanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.",

      "fullText": "\nWe are said to live in a \u2018post-truth\u2019 world. In 2016, the term was named Oxford Word of the Year. While the immediate motivation for the term may have been a description of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cwar on truth\u201d, in reality, the subversion of truth has been a strategy used for millennia by rulers, their emissaries and their spies.\nFrom the Trojan Horse to the falsehood of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, certainty and doubt, trust and deception keep exchanging places, confusing the general populations.\nHistory is riddled with \u2018double-speak\u2019. While one hand is held out to help, the other is filling a pocket. Where the world sees genocide in Palestine, Zionists see the \u2018promised land.\u2019 Artist Khalil Chishtee made a sculpture with plastic bags of two men embracing while each holds a gun behind his back.\nTaking liberties with the truth is justified by advertisers, by politicians and by defence lawyers. It is considered acceptable because people are aware these are strategies and learn to read between the lines. People learn to negotiate fake news, as the saying goes now: \u201cSwipe for truth and scroll for doubt \u2014 the algorithm will sort it out.\u201d\nAccessing, understanding and manipulating the \u2018truth\u2019 has preoccupied and puzzled people across history \u2014 and it continues to do so\nThe real casualty is not the lie, which time always reveals, but the loss of trust. Once, the media, respected public personalities and institutions, and religious leaders were expected to be truthful. Today, the public finds itself undefended, left to navigate a minefield of partisan, managed or fake news. The loss of faith is understandable. Whether in America or in Pakistan, the public feels outrage that the officials paid by their taxes to protect their borders and streets, and manage government, are only protecting their own interests.\nSeeking the truth has occupied philosophers for millennia. We often use the word, yet cannot define it. Most people would say they just know in their heart of hearts or simply sense the truth. Samuel Abel, environmentalist and co-founder of the Eden Foundation, concludes we have no need of truth. It\u2019s more pragmatic to accept shared beliefs, such as nationalism, cultural identity or religion, what Socrates called \u201cthe noble lie\u201d, even if they are completely made up.\nThis is because people cannot comprehend the truth in its pure sense or don\u2019t want to face uncomfortable truths. A person need not know how electricity is produced in order to turn on a lightbulb. It is enough to experience the reality that, when a lamp is turned on, the room gets lit.\nWhile reality is an objective fact, truth tends to be subjective, measured by the limits of a person\u2019s own understanding. A car crash is the reality, but how it was caused can have multiple versions, each true in its own way.\nIn Arabic, instead of a word for abstract \u2018truth\u2019, there is haq [reality] or sadaqat [sincerity]. The Quran asks believers to observe reality and act with sincerity. Yet, every Sufi is on a quest for \u2018the truth\u2019 and those that apparently find it cannot share what they find. Rumi explains: \u201cA seeker of truth looks beyond the apparent and contemplates the hidden.\u201d\nSo what is \u2018the truth\u2019? Plato describes truth as abstract spiritual perfection. The Sufis believe truth is synonymous with God and can only be experienced through a spiritual journey and not by rational knowledge.\nYet, no one would deny the existence of truth or say it does not matter. Society\u2019s structures could not exist without a correlation with truth: no laws could be formulated, no scientific discoveries made, no parents teaching children correct values. So, how can ordinary people, who cannot follow the Sufi path, access truth? From the earliest societies, humans have turned to the arts to comprehend the universe.\nPablo Picasso said, \u201cArt is a lie that makes us realise truth.\u201d We all know an actor is playing a role, yet we easily trust the truth of the story told. The words of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Bulleh Shah, William Shakespeare and many more protect and preserve universal truths from the ethos of cynicism.\nThe arts, with their ability to delve into the depths of human experience, bypassing the restraints of rationality, reveal profound insights that are intuitively recognised as truth.\nDurriya Kazi is a Karachi-based artist.\nShe may be reached atdurriyakazi1918@gmail.com\nPublished in Dawn, EOS, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: The death toll from the blaze at Gul Plaza on Karachi\u2019s M.A. Jinnah Road rose to six on Sunday, with three more people, including a firefighter, losing their lives, while 26 others were injured and 59 were still missing, officials said.\nAuthorities said the fire, which erupted on Saturday night, was almost contained after 24-hour-long efforts. A search operation was underway amid fears of further casualties at the time of going to press.\nOfficials initially suspected an electrical short-circuit, but said the cause was yet to be confirmed.\nThe fire spread rapidly, fuelled by combustible mat\u00aderial stored in around 1,200 shops in the ground-plus-three-storey building, spr\u00adead over 8,000 square yards.\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people had gathered aro\u00adund the building, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.\nParts of the building collapsed during the firefighting operation. Tra\u00adders\u2019 bodies estimated financial losses of up to Rs25 billion and claiming that 5,000 people worked in the shops.\nSindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the fire and fix responsibility.\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that six men, aged in their 20s and 30s, were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. Post-mortem examinations were conducted and the cause of death was declared inhalation injuries and burns, she said.\nMoreover, 26 men, aged 18 to 45, were brought for treatment, with 11 suffering burn injuries, she said, adding that all were discharged after first aid as none of them had suffered critical injuries.\nShe said \u201cmass disaster protocols\u201d had been activated at hospitals after officials provided a list of missing persons, including women and children, and warned that the death toll could rise.\nRescue 1122 spokesperson Hass\u00ada\u00adanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that they received the initial call at around 1:38am on Sunday. He said rescuers were first told the fire started in a shop dealing in artificial flowers on the ground floor before spreading to the basement and upper levels.\nHe said the building housed shops containing clothing, plastic goods, suitcases and chemicals used for perfumes and cosmetics, while the top level had a roof and parking area.\nRescue teams, including those from Rescue 1122, the Karachi Met\u00adropolitan Corporation fire brigade, Pakistan Navy and the Karachi Port Trust, rescued around 50 people safely on Saturday-Sunday night, he said.\nAnother 20 people were rescued in injured condition, but three later died. Mr Khan said two bodies were recovered from debris late on Sunday night, while a 25-year-old firefighter, Furqan Ali, lost his life when part of the building collapsed and debris fell on him.\nHe said the intensity of the blaze had weakened the pillars, and the rear portion of the building had already collapsed, with the remaining half of the structure at risk.\nQuoting Sindh Building Control Authority officials, he said the building was constructed in the 1990s and an additional floor was added in 2003.\n59 missing; Rs25bn losses\nSouth DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police had a list of 59 missing persons. \u201cSo far, we have shortlisted seven of them based on their call details,\u201d he said, adding that their phones were last traced to the plaza before being switched off.\nSindh Chief Minister Shah, Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, IGP Javed Alam Odho and other senior officials visited the site and reviewed the rescue operation.\nMeanwhile, All City Tajir Ittehad, an alliance of traders\u2019 bodies, said in a statement that its representatives estimated losses of Rs20bn to Rs25bn, including the value of goods and reconstruction costs.\n\u201cThis is not only the destruction of a building but a source of livelihood for thousands,\u201d it said, insisting that over 5,000 people worked in more than 1,200 shops.\nPresident, PM grieve\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday expressed sorrow over the death of firefighter Furqan Ali, praising his bravery and offering condolences to the bereaved family, according to a statement from the President\u2019s Secretariat. He stressed that fire safety and emergency res\u00adp\u00adonse systems should be strengthened to prevent such tragedies in the future.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the loss of life and directed authorities to take all possible steps to protect lives and property. \u201cThe affected traders and other victims would be provided with every possible assistance,\u201d he said.\nPM Shehbaz also spoke to the Sindh chief minister by phone to express sorrow over the loss of lives and offered the Centre\u2019s full support to the provincial government.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

      "fullText": "NUUK: European countries sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland on Thursday as Denmark said it was pressing on with plans for a  \u201clarger and more permanent\u201d Nato presence to secure the island coveted by US President Donald Trump.\nThe modest European deployments, meant to help Denmark prepare military exercises, sent a strong message of support a day after a meeting of officials from the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to reach any break-through on the impasse.\nAfter that meeting, Trump repeated his assertion that  Denmark could not be relied upon  to protect its autonomous territory, Greenland, if Russia or China ever wanted to occupy it.\nTrump says the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to US security and has not ruled out the use of force to take it. Greenland and Denmark say it is not for sale and that threats of force are reckless.\nOn Thursday, Denmark\u2019s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, told journalists in Copenhagen he did not have a final figure for the envisaged expanded Nato presence in Greenland. \u201cBut it is clear that we now will be able to plan for a larger and more permanent presence throughout 2026 and that is crucial to show that security in the Arctic is not only for the Kingdom of Denmark it is for all of Nato.\u201d\nNato future\nProminent EU countries have backed Denmark, warning that a US military seizure of Greenland could spell the end of Nato. Before Wednesday\u2019s meeting in the US, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun to increase their military presence in and around Greenland in cooperation with Nato allies.\nDenmark had about 150 military and civilian personnel working at its Joint Arctic Command on the island.\nGermany, France, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands have said they are sending military staff to begin preparations for larger drills later this year.\nIn Nuuk, business owner Mads Petersen said it would be strange to see more military troops. \u201cI don\u2019t hope it is the new normal,\u201d he said.\nKremlin rejects Nato talk\nRussia said on Thursday Nato\u2019s talk of Moscow and Beijing being a threat to Greenland was a myth designed to whip up hysteria and warned of the dangers of escalating confrontation in the region. Still, any attempt to ignore Russia\u2019s interests in the Arctic would not go unanswered, a foreign ministry spokeswoman later said.\nThere is currently little evidence that a large number of Chinese and Russian ships sail near Greenland\u2019s coasts.\nPart of Danish territory  \u201chas been  included in Washington\u2019s arbitrarily defined sphere of US interests,\u201d  Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.\n\u201cAgainst  this backdrop, the myth of some kind of Russian threat, rigorously  promoted by Denmark and other members of the European Union and NATO for  many years, is especially hypocritical.\u201d Both Nato and Russia have  bulked up their military presence in the Arctic in recent years, as  melting sea ice opens the region up to international shipping and mining  activities.\nForeign troops\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday about 200 U.S. troops were currently stationed in Greenland, which has a population of around 57,000. The scale of the planned European military build-up has not been made public, but initial deployments appear small.\nThe German Armed Forces were deploying a reconnaissance team of 13, first to Copenhagen, before heading on to Greenland with Danish personnel. Late on Wednesday, a Danish Air Force plane landed at Nuuk airport and personnel in military fatigues disembarked.\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2026",

      "fullText": "Pakistan recorded 8,488 gigawatt-hours of power generation in December 2025, marking a nine per cent increase compared to the same month last year, according to data released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).\nOutput in December also saw an increase of 5pc compared with November levels, but remained well below the peaks recorded in the summer months of last year.\nThe average cost of electricity generation climbed to Rs9.6 per kilowatt-hour in December, up 2pc from the same month last year and 56pc higher than November.\nJS Research attributes this increase to a decline in hydropower generation in December. Hydropower generation fell 51pc in the month compared to November. Hydropower contributed 18pc to the energy mix during the month, forcing reliance on more expensive thermal sources. These patterns are expected during the winter months.\nDecember\u2019s electricity generation mix was dominated by coal (24pc) and nuclear (25pc), followed by RLNG (17pc). Coal generation saw an increase of 125pc compared to the same month last year, while nuclear output posted modest growth of 3pc.\nThe data shows the government\u2019s shift away from furnace oil, traditionally the most expensive source of power generation. Furthermore, renewable sources, including wind, solar, and bagasse, accounted for 1.9pc, 0.9pc, and 1.1pc of the total mix, indicating limited penetration of clean energy in the national grid.",

      "fullText": "NEPRA\u2019S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.\nIn fact, the power sector\u2019s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector\u2019s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector\u2019s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator\u2019s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) endured a highly volatile week but managed to close on a positive note, buoyed by a sharp rally in the final session as easing geopolitical tensions and robust large-scale manufacturing (LSM) data revived investor confidence.\nAfter remaining under pressure due to regional uncertainties and mixed macroeconomic signals, bulls returned with force on Friday. The benchmark KSE-100 index surged by more than 3,642 points in a single session, reclaiming the 185,000 level and snapping a two-session decline.\nDespite the dramatic finish, weekly gains remained modest. According to Topline Securities Ltd, the KSE-100 index posted a week-on-week increase of just 0.37 per cent, sharply lower than the 3pc gain recorded in the previous week. The brokerage attributed the slowdown in momentum to reduced inflows from local mutual funds amid heightened geopolitical tensions linked to the US-Iran situation.\nMarket activity also weakened. Average daily traded volume fell 24pc week-on-week to 982 million shares, while average daily value declined 26pc to Rs58.5 billion, reflecting cautious investor participation.\nFriday surge offset geopolitical jitters and subdued trading activity\nKey economic developments during the week provided some support. Data released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association showed car sales of 13,280 units in December 2025, marking a 35pc increase year-on-year, though down 14pc month-on-month. Meanwhile, the LSM index posted a strong 10.37pc year-on-year growth in November 2025 and a marginal 0.16pc month-on-month increase, reinforcing expectations of a gradual economic recovery.\nThe bond market also signalled optimism. In the latest Pakistan Investment Bonds auction, the government raised Rs488bn against a target of Rs450bn, with cut-off yields declining by 59 to 70 basis points across various tenors. The fall in yields reflected growing expectations of a policy rate cut at the upcoming monetary policy meeting on Jan 26.\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd (AHL), the KSE-100 index remained largely range-bound for most of the week before closing at 185,099 points, up 689 points or 0.4pc week-on-week. The brokerage noted that market sentiment stayed subdued amid escalating geopolitical uncertainty, but improved sharply on Friday due to fresh liquidity, easing tensions and strengthened expectations of monetary easing.\nOn the macro front, oil production rose 1.1pc week-on-week to 65,444 barrels per day, led by higher output from northern fields amid reduced curtailment. Gas production increased to 3,012 million cubic feet per day, the highest level since mid-March 2025, driven by increased supply to the fertiliser and power sectors. Prices of motor spirit and high-speed diesel remained unchanged at Rs253.17 and Rs257.08 per litre, respectively.\nForeign exchange indicators showed marginal improvement. State Bank of Pakistan-held reserves increased by $16.1 million to $16.1bn, while the rupee appreciated slightly by 0.03pc week-on-week to close at Rs279.95 against the US dollar.\nAHL expects the market to remain positive in the coming week, supported by the approaching monetary policy decision and anticipation of a rate cut. The brokerage added that the ongoing corporate result season could provide further upside, particularly in case of positive earnings surprises. The KSE-100 index is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.2 times, offering an attractive dividend yield of around 5.4pc.\nAKD Securities Ltd also highlighted sustained volatility during the week but noted that bullish momentum ultimately prevailed as geopolitical risks began to subside and positive macroeconomic developments emerged. The brokerage pointed to defence export discussions with regional partners and strong LSM growth as supportive factors.\nSector-wise, transport, paper and board, oil and gas exploration, property, and automobile parts were among the top performers, while textile-related sectors lagged. In terms of investor flows, individuals and mutual funds were net buyers, whereas banks and insurance companies remained net sellers.\nOverall, analysts believe that while near-term volatility may persist, improving macro indicators and expectations of monetary easing could keep the PSX on a constructive path in the weeks ahead.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "\nKARACHI: After a mild recovery overnight following a three-session of continuous battering, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday came under renewed selling pressure as investors res\u00adumed profit-taking amid a dearth of any positive triggers and mounting regional tensions, pulling the benchmark KSE-100 below the 183,000-point barrier.\nTopline Securities Ltd said the bourse witnessed a round of profit-taking as investors chose to lock in gains following the recent rally. The benchmark index remained volatile throughout the session, hitting an intraday high of 775 points and a low of 1,581 points before closing at 182,569.82, down 1,381.69 points or 0.75pc.\nDefying the broader market trend, the E&P sector emerged as a notable outperformer. Oil and Gas Development Com\u00adpany rose 2.95pc, while Pakistan Petroleum gained 2.12pc, both closing higher than the previous session amid selective buying interest in energy stocks.\nOn the index front, heavyweights including OGDCL, PPL, Askari Bank, Meezan Bank, and Atlas Honda Ltd lent support, collectively contributing 429 points. Conversely, weakness in United Bank, MCB Bank, Fauji Fertiliser, Lucky Cement, and Hub Power weighed on sentiment, shaving 897 points off the benchmark.\nTrading activity rem\u00adained subdued, with total market volume fell to 1.031 billion shares. However, the value of shares traded rose 5.19pc to Rs65.9bn. K-Electric led the volume chart, with 56 million shares traded.\nAli Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Ltd, attributed the subdued market momentum to heightened geopolitical tensions, as investors adopted a cautious stance amid escalating uncertainty in the Middle East.\nOn the macro front, Bloomberg expects Pak\u00adistan\u2019s recent inflation slowdown to 5.6pc year-on-year to be temporary. CPI is projected to reaccelerate due to base effects, stronger demand, and rising energy prices, with inflation potentially nearing 8pc by 4QFY26. This outlook suggests the SBP is likely to maintain its policy rate at 10.5pc, with upside risks stemming from potential oil price shocks.\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2026",

The initiative gained mom\u00adentum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.\nOfficial figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan\u2019s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns for TY2025.\nOf the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns for TY2025, only 43.20pc of those exist on tax rolls with the tax authorities, placing the profession among the least compliant sectors in the tax system.\nMoreover, even among those who filed tax returns, income declarations point to widespread underreporting, raising questions about enforcement, transparency, and the credibility of declared earnings within one of the country\u2019s most established and high earning professions.\nOfficers deputed at private hospitals to monitor revenue and ensure tax compliance\nA senior tax official toldDawnthat the FBR has begun deploying IRS officers directly at the premises of commercial entities, including private hospitals and clinics, to strengthen monitoring and enforcement. According to the official, these officers are tasked with observing the provision of medical services and the collection of receipts in real time.\nIn the first phase, officers have been posted at 50 commercial hospitals under Section175-C of the Income Tax Ordinance. The objective is to identify underreporting of revenues, particularly from high inpatient occupancy charges that, in some cases, exceed the rates charged by five star hotels.\n\u201cWe will identify non-compliant doctors through this exercise,\u201d the official said, adding that private notices are being issued to encourage voluntary compliance. The official noted that voluntary compliance from doctors has already begun following the issuance of these notices.\nThe data place the number of registered doctors on the tax rolls at 130,243, of whom 56,287 filed income tax returns in TY2025, about 43pc of those registered. Among the filers, 48,704 doctors declared income, representing roughly 87pc of those who submitted returns.\nOfficial figures showed that only around two in five registered doctors filed income tax returns in TY2025, with an even smaller share reporting taxable income.\nHowever, 7,583 doctors reported zero income in their tax returns for TY2025.\nFurther analysis of the returns showed that 30,000 doctors of the 48,704 doctors have declared less than Rs2 million annual income, which accounted for 61.59pc of all doctors who declared taxable income in their returns. This percentage goes to 65 percent of total return filers, who declared less than Rs2 million annual income.\nMoreover, most doctors fall in the lower reported income brackets.\nWithin the below Rs2m income bracket, the breakdown of tax returns declarations further highlights the scale of low declared earnings.\nAs many as 341 doctors reported annual income between Re1 and Rs100,000 in their returns, 17,647 doctors declared income ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1m, while 12,959 reported annual earnings between Rs1m and Rs2m for TY2025.\nAccording to data, a sharp decline in the number of doctors as income levels rise. The data show 6,655 doctors fall within the Rs2m to Rs3m annual income bracket, 6,959 doctors are in the Rs3m to Rs5m range, and 3,093 doctors declared annual income between Rs5m and Rs10m.\nAt the highest end of the scale, only 1,050 doctors declared annual income exceeding Rs10m in TY2025.According to the FBR, statistics highlight two gaps, first between registered doctors and those filing their tax returns, and second between filers and the income levels declared with the largest concentration of declarations below Rs2m per year in TY2025.\nPublished in Dawn, December 26th, 2025",

      "fullText": "Meaningful relief for compliant income tax payers, salaried individuals and the corporate sector \u2014 who together contribute roughly half of Pakistan\u2019s revenues \u2014 appears unlikely. Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead.\nTo avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy.\nThose who trust the Federal Board of Revenue\u2019s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure.\nIn 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government\u2019s economic team\u2019s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF.\nA recent media report indicates that the IMF, which is closely monitoring Pakistan\u2019s economic trajectory, also expects tax collection to remain broadly stagnant in CY26.\nThere appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best\nFrom 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratioroseto 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27.\nFBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal.\nMusadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. \u201cBoth the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.\u201d\nDr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. \u201cAt best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,\u201d he said.\nA source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. \u201cI support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF\u2019s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.\u201d\nDr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. \u201cSubstantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.\u201d\nHe also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand.\nCovering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential.\nFormer federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan\u2019s economic discourse. \u201cAll we hear is \u2018tax, tax, tax\u2019, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,\u201d he remarked.\nRehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. \u201cThere is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF\u2019s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor.\n\u201cI expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.\u201d\nChairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 29th, 2025",

For this purpose, he said: \u201ctruth and reconciliation is part of the PPP manifesto as well as the Charter of Democracy, but this point is yet to be implemented\u201d.\nHe stressed that the PPP wants concrete progress on the pending points of the CoD, including the establishment of a truth and reconciliation mechanism.\nHe called for a \u2018dialogue\u2019 to establish a \u2018Truth and Reconc\u00adliation Commission\u2019 with all political forces.\nCritical about inefficiency and failure of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in meeting the set targets of tax collection, he said that it would be unwise and illogical for the federal government to punish the provinces for FBR\u2019s failure in achieving the targets. He said Sindh was ready to collect taxes on services and goods if it was authorised. He claimed that the province could generate more revenue than the FBR and contribute a larger share to the federation.\nHe was a bitter opponent of any cuts in the provinces\u2019 share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, taking stand that provinces could not be penalised by slashing their NFC allocations because of FBR\u2019s poor and feeble performance.\nKhuhro said that the party would not allow any rollback of the protection guaranteed to provinces\u2019 shares under the 18th Constitutional Amendment, nor would it accept any attempt to undo the amendment.\nHe said that under the leadership of Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, the PPP had already resisted rollback of NFC Award\u2019s key clauses through the 27th Amendment and would continue to safeguard provinces\u2019 rights in the future as well.\nHe maintained that while the Constitution allows an increase in provinces\u2019 shares in the NFC Award, it does not permit any reduction.\nHe said that if the federal government wants to allocate a share to Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir from the Award, it should do so from its own share.\nThe Sindh PPP chief categorically stated that no new provinces were being created and that there would never be a new province to be carved out from within Sindh.\nPublished in Dawn, December 26th, 2025",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Institute of Cost and Management Accoun\u00adtants (ICMA) on Wednesday recommended a set of measures as follow-up actions onGovernance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment(GCDA) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for governance reforms in key regulatory, fiscal and judicial sectors to stop waste of national resources and revive national economy.\nIn a 52-page blue print presented to the government, the body of accounting and management professionals said its report contained a set of specific proposals across 32 priority areas. \u201cIt is our professional duty and national contribution to provide this blueprint for building stronger, more transparent and accountable institutions. We stand ready to support the government, the IMF, and all stakeholders in the vital work of implementation, leveraging the expertise of our members to drive meaningful and lasting reform,\u201d wrote ICMA vice-president Muhammad Yasin to the government.\nMr Yasin explained that ICMA review translated the IMF\u2019s diagnostic into a phased implementation matrix, assigning a set of specific actions to responsible agencies, including the Finance Division, FBR, and SECP, with clear short-, medium-, and long-term deadlines. \u201cThis transforms high-level recommendations into an accountable, government-wide project plan, directly addressing the historic gap between reform pledges and on-the-ground execution\u201d, he said.\nThe report covered five critical pillars to drive national renewal. First, it targets budget and revenue leaks that drain public resources. To address IMF concerns over opaque budgeting, the ICMA blueprint champions an independent Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) for objective scrutiny and a Public Investment Monitoring Unit (PIMU) for real-time project oversight. There should also be a Revenue Intelligence Unit (RIU) within FBR for data-driven audits and a Tax Reform and Simplification Unit to rationalise complex laws. A dedicated SOE Performance and Oversight Unit should be mandated to curb fiscal drains, while a consolidated Debt Management Office should bring transparency and discipline to national borrowing.\nNext, it focused on IMF findings on judicial backlog and weak contract enforcement saying the delayed justice was hindering business and citizen rights. It called for specialized commercial benches, nationwide digital case management, and publication of court performance data. A central pillar should be the strategic expansion of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), empowering the International Mediation and Arbitration Centre (IMAC) to unclog courts. To instill integrity, a comprehensive national ethics framework with verified conflict-of-interest disclosures has been proposed.\nThen it talked about strengthening accountability to fight widespread corruption. It said the new plan should tackle the fragmented anti-corruption apparatus head-on.\nTo counter fragmentation noted by the IMF, ICMA proposed a National Anti-Corruption Coordination Council (NACC) to unify NAB, FIA, and provincial agencies through shared intelligence.\nEnhanced whistleblower protections with secure channels have been emphasized. The report calls for merit-based, transparent appointments for the heads of all key regulatory bodies (SECP, CCP, NAB) to ensure independence and effectiveness.\nAfter that, it called for digital and regulatory reform to modernize governance for a modern state.\nPublished in Dawn, December 25th, 2025",

This has given some semblance of confidence to the potential investors, but this is reflected mainly in the shuffling of the acquisition of ownership of existing assets by leading Pakistani business houses and some GCC companies taking over some of the foreign companies exiting the country.\nDespite this, the investment rate and domestic savings rate, as well as the generation of non-debt-creating external flows, have remained below expectations, giving rise to the concern about the future growth trajectory. To find productive jobs for the two million young men and women, we would need a warranted rate of growth between six per cent to 7pc, but the projected rates in medium-term hover between 3-4pc.\nThe finance minister has rightly emphasised that we have to move away from an aid-dependent model to an investment-led and export-oriented model. The serious question is whether in 2026 we would witness any evidence of this change in direction by taking some tough political economy decisions that would disrupt the benefits enjoyed by the existing elites and result in a vibrant private sector and devolved local governments delivering basic public goods and services to the majority of the population.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 29th, 2025",

      "fullText": "GILGIT-BALTISTAN (GB) is going to the polls next year. Theannouncementby the GB chief election commissioner was not only about general elections, it also notified the holding of the much-awaited local bodies elections. The region, with its unique civic challenges and marred by development issues, has been governed without local bodies for two decades.\nThis has put enormous strain on successive elected governments as people \u2014 desperate for their daily civic needs such as electricity, water, sanitation, road repairs etc \u2014 look towards their elected representatives in the GB Assembly.\nAs the region is governed primarily through the federal government, GB\u2019s reliance upon the centre and the budget granted to it has increased over time. Although GB has a legislative assembly of its own, the key decisions rest with the centre and its powerful bureaucracy.\nThis reliance is one of the reasons why the candidates and the voters in some cases look towards the ruling party in the centre before elections. This results in political defections in GB which have become a norm and are neither considered unethical nor immoral. While the defections generally occur before elections (as is currently happening) the outgoing government faced them within three years of coming into power. As the wind changed in the centre due to the no-confidence vote, the fate of the then-ruling PTI in GB was also sealed.\nThe then-GB CM and PTI\u2019s regional president Khalid Khursheed Khan was disqualified by the GB Chief Court on the basis of obtaining a fake degree. Consequently, political instability, wrangling and defections have cast a shadow over the outgoing government.\nThe defections also do not matter much in the local context of GB. Voters in many constituencies, if not all, vote for the influential and prominent political figures who are well-known in the community and in a few cases, due to tribal affinity. Since the region desperately needs development, hence the ruling party in the centre is the best pick for these candidates. Before elections, the parties announce development schemes to tilt voters in their favour. The infrastructure of GB demands urgent attention. Due to difficult terrain, it deserves special focus which the successive governments have failed to deliver.\nThe region\u2019s key decisions rest with the centre and its powerful bureaucracy.\nDecades of neglect in the public health system have resulted in lack of health facilities, functioning laboratories, life-saving equipment, and availability of doctors across GB.\nPeople in many cases take patients to what they call \u2018down country\u2019 for treatment, putting an additional burden on their finances. Even the basic facilities such as electricity, clean water and sanitation remain rare in many areas. Despite all these challenges, including a limited budget, the push to create more districts in GB is strange. In some areas, with a population of less than 50,000, carving out a district puts an additional burden on the limited budget. GB now pays more in salaries and spends less on its development, which should be the other way around.\nA further burden on already meagre resources is tourism. While the recent boom in tourism and hordes of tourists arriving in GB has brought short-term benefits to the local population, the carbon footprint of these people and their vehicles has already started affecting the weather. GB is an ecologically fragile area. It cannot cater to mass tourism. GB needs a rational policy toward ecotourism and its implementation, benefitting local communities and the natural environment.\nTaking tourists to mountain tops in a five-door jeep is not wise, neither are concrete hotels and guesthouses without proper sewerage and garbage disposal systems. Unfortunately, this is what has been done to GB in the name of promoting tourism which is evidently changing the region\u2019s fragile weather.\nThe elephant is in the room now. In the last few years, flash floods have destroyed homes, bridges, hundreds of hectares of agricultural land and displaced population of several villages.\nThis year, Ghizer, Ghanche, Skardu and other areas faced unprecedented floods that deprived many people of their livelihoods. The incoming government will have to confront these challenges and formulate effective and long-term policies to provide meaningful relief to the population. Not to forget, GB has a large educated, yet unemployed youth population which will likely place significant pressure on the government for effective governance. A glimpse of this has been witnessed in the past five years, when the region was embroiled in mass demonstrations and large sit-ins over one issue or the other.\nThese protests were against the state\u2019s attempt to end the wheat subsidy given to GB, and to impose tax. Sharp criticism was made of theGB Land Reforms Act of 2025and against the arrests of leaders of the Awami Action Committee \u2014 vocal against certain government decisions \u2014 by civil society activists as well as political and religious circles. The longest sit-in of almost two months at the Sost dry port by GB traders and businessmen against the government\u2019s effort to impose sales tax, advance income tax, and federal excise duty through FBR, resulted in the decision to exempt imports worth up to Rs4 billion from federal taxes if the goods are for local consumption.\nThe protesters demanded representation in the national legislature as a precondition to impose tax. The federal government\u2019s move reopened the old wound and regenerated the debate of the region\u2019s constitutional status and parliamentary representation.\nWhether the incoming government will be able to resolve the chronic issue of GB\u2019s representation is yet to be seen. While the future of GB remains uncertain, the formulation and implementation of effective and inclusive policies have the potential to mitigate the looming crises and place GB on a more stable and sustainable path.\nThe writer is Assistant Professor and fellow of the Centre for Business and Economic Research at IBA, Karachi.\nX:@saj_ahmd\nPublished in Dawn, December 26th, 2025",

Cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth.",
      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: With a 1.4 percentage-point increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio last year, mostly through additional revenue measures worth Rs2.5 trillion, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) now expects the federal tax contribution to remain stagnant over the next five years and a slight improvement coming from provinces.\nThe latest IMF estimates suggest Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) receipts rose from 8.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023-24 to 10.3pc in 2024-25, but still missed the Fund\u2019s programme target of 10.7pc.\nFor the current fiscal year, the IMF projects FBR revenue at 11.1pc of GDP, which would then remain flat at that level until FY30.\nIn absolute terms, FBR revenue increased from Rs9.3tr in FY24 to Rs11.74tr in FY25, with a massive shortfall. For the current year, collections are projected at Rs13.98tr, implying a shortfall of Rs328 billion under existing assumptions.\nThe IMF noted that tax revenue collection in FY25 fell short by Rs1.224tr relative to budget projections and by Rs524bn relative to the lender\u2019s first review target. About Rs850bn of the shortfall relative to the budget reflected faster-than-expected inflation deceleration and lower-than-expected GDP growth in FY25.\nForecasts provincial taxes to offset stagnant federal collections\nThe inflation deceleration at the end of FY25 led to a revenue shortfall of Rs157bn relative to the first IMF review target. The remaining portion of about Rs380bn was broadly linked to administrative and enforcement challenges that remained unaddressed throughout FY25, chiefly because of prolonged settlement of tax court cases that delayed the recovery of significant revenue amounts.\nOverall revenues, including non-tax receipts, rose sharply to 15.9pc of GDP by the end of FY25 from 12.6pc in FY24. The Fund attributed the increase mainly to stronger receipts from the petroleum levy and State Bank profits.\nThe IMF expects the petroleum levy to remain a key source of revenue, rising from Rs1.02tr in FY24 to more than Rs2.2tr by FY30. It projected the levy\u2019s contribution at about 1.1pc of GDP over the medium term, rising to around 1.2pc in the current and next fiscal years before easing back.\nThe Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30, while the sales tax ratio is expected to hover around its existing level of 3.5-3.6pc of GDP.\nIt said major contributions are projected to come from provincial taxes on the expectations of successful implementation of the agriculture income tax and sales taxes on services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to increase from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27, rise further to 1.6pc of GDP in FY28 and then stay flat until FY30.\nIn absolute numbers, the four provinces that collected Rs929bn in FY25 are expected to deliver Rs1.22tr during the current fiscal and further improve their collection to Rs1.77tr in FY27. They would build upon this base to collect Rs2.5tr in FY28, Rs2.8tr in FY29 and cross Rs3.1tr in FY30.\nThe Fund said projected FBR collections would depend on advancing reforms to raise revenues through tax policy simplification and base broadening, supporting fiscal sustainability and creating space for climate resilience, social protection, human capital development and public investment.\nIt noted that FBR revenues rose 26pc year-on-year in FY25 to 10.3pc of GDP, a historically high level, but overall tax revenue still fell short of the target by 0.3pc of GDP, largely due to delays in resolving court cases over disputed taxes (0.4pc of GDP) and lower-than-expected inflation. Lower-than-budgeted federal subsidies and grants, estimated at 0.2pc of GDP, helped offset the impact of the revenue shortfall.\nThe IMF said provinces had begun implementing new agricultural income tax (AIT) regimes, including measures to strengthen compliance and address underreporting.\n\u201cHowever, significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, notably fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities,\u201d the Fund observed, adding that the provinces have also ensured that all services, except for a limited list of exemptions, are subject to GST.\nIt said the cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc, as has been the case for Pakistan over a long time.\nIn this way, the Fund projected the consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.4pc of GDP in FY25, easing to 4pc this year, before declining to 3.2pc in FY27 and FY28, and then to 2.8pc in FY30.\nPublished in Dawn, December 22nd, 2025",

      "fullText": "\u2022 Report finds lending to private sector lowest in Pakistan\u2022 Undocumented economy is 40pc of GDP\nKARACHI: The advances to deposits ratio (ADR) further declined from 50 per cent in December 2024 to just 35pc as of June this year, while the investments to deposits ratio (IDR) surged from 90pc to 100pc during the same period, according to a report.\nThe Banking Publication 2025 titled \u201cBanking Forward: Journeying Towards Future Horizons\u201dreleasedby PwC-A.F. Ferguson on Friday said Pakistan\u2019s ADR remains significantly lower than Bang\u00adla\u00addesh at 87pc, India at 79pc and Sri Lanka at 59pc. In contrast, Pakistan\u2019s IDR of 100pc is much higher than Bangladesh at 29pc, India at 33pc and Sri Lanka at 47pc.\nAccording to the report, priority sector financing continues to remain at sub-optimal levels, with SME contribution to total loans at 3.7pc and agriculture at 4pc. In comparison, SME lending as a percentage of total loans is considerably higher in other countries, including Indonesia at 19pc, Bangladesh at 17pc and India at 16pc.\nMeanwhile, lending to the private sector declined to 11pc of GDP in 2024. Con\u00adversely, the IDR has increased sharply, rising from 40pc in 2010 to 93pc in 2024 and reaching 100pc as of June 2025.\nAccording to the report, SMEs and the agriculture sector are central to Pakistan\u2019s economy, together representing millions of enterprises across both formal and informal segments. Agriculture contributes 24pc to GDP, while SMEs account for 40pc of GDP, 90pc of enterprises, 30pc of export earnings and employ nearly 30pc of the workforce.\nAgricultural borrowers increased by 200,000, reaching 2.9 million by June 2025, while SME borrowers rose by over 55pc to 277,000 during the same period.\nThe report said industry experts emphasised that a large share of Pakistan\u2019s transactions remains cash-based, contributing to an undocumented economy estimated at 40pc of GDP. Digitising a portion of these transactions could save Rs164 billion annually, while reducing the undocumented economy by 25pc has the potential to unlock over Rs1 trillion in resources, the report added.\nAs of June 2025, agricultural financing rose to Rs739bn, accounting for 5.2pc of total loans, up from 3.4pc in December 2024. SME lending increased to Rs712bn, representing 5pc of total loans.\nRecent initiatives by the regulator and the industry have led to notable progress, with financing to priority sectors surpassing 10pc of total loans, indicating a reversal of historical declining trends. \u201cDespite this positive trend, financing levels remain low compared to regional peers, highlighting the need for expanded credit interventions,\u201d the report said.\nExperts also emphasised the need for sustained fiscal discipline, comprehensive tax reforms, improved governance of state-owned enterprises and reduced government debt to maintain and strengthen economic progress, according to the report. \u201cThe urgent need to diversify and expand exports has been stressed upon, advocating a shift from consumption-driven growth to a value-added export base,\u201d it added.\nExperts further highlighted that boosting domestic investment and productivity is critical for successful import substitution, which requires removing bureaucra\u00adtic hurdles, simplifying regulations and cre\u00ad\u00adating an investor-friendly environment.\nCash continues to pose a challenge to financial inclusion and digitisation, with Pakistan\u2019s cash-in-circulation ratio at 34pc, compared to Bangladesh at 16pc, India at 15pc and Kenya at 9pc, the report noted.\nIn Pakistan, paper-based transactions account for 14pc of total transactions, while ATM traffic constitutes 25pc of e-transactions.\n\u201cThere is greater need for broader government and regulatory push to create a wider ecosystem that incentivises digital and disincentivises cash,\u201d the report said.\nThe report added that the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s instant payment system, Raast, recorded 45 million registered IDs by June 2025 and processed 1.3bn transactions worth Rs29.6tr, more than doubling in both volume and value compared to the previous year. It said the number of QR-enabled merchants also crossed one million, twice as many as a year earlier.\nHowever, adoption remains uneven across the economy. Only about 159,000 merchants currently use point-of-sale terminals, far fewer than in comparable emerging markets, while mobile banking penetration stands at roughly 15pc of total bank accounts, the report said.\nPublished in Dawn, December 27th, 2025",

      "fullText": "The year 2025 was exceptional for Pakistan\u2019s geoeconomics and geopolitics. The most dramatic moment was the May 7\u201310conflictwith India, a confrontation whose political and economic repercussions continue to shape Pakistan\u2019s trajectory. In its aftermath, Pakistan emerged more confident, actively pursuing defence and strategic economic partnerships to reinforce its long-term security.\nThe economy also saw a significant improvement in global perception, reflected in successive upgrades by major international rating agencies, including Fitch, S&P, and Moody\u2019s. These upgrades noted strengthened macroeconomic stability, an improved external position, and steadier foreign exchange reserves. The primary balance, showing that the government\u2019s revenues exceed its non-interest expenditures, rose to a historic high of 2.4 per cent of GDP. Equally notable was the sharp decline in headline inflation, which fell below 5pc, its lowest level in seven years.\nThe launch of a new, outward-looking trade policy, signalling a decisive break from decades of protectionism, is one of the most consequential reforms. The five-year policy aims to make Pakistan one of the most open economies in the region by eliminating para-tariffs, streamlining exemptions, simplifying the tax structure, capping the maximum rate at 15pc, and reducing tariffs on nearly half of all tariff lines, with almost half going to zero. If fully implemented, it would rank Pakistan among the world\u2019s most ambitious tariff reformers over the past two decades, according to the World Bank, sending a strong signal of commitment to competitiveness, global integration, and export-led growth.\nAnother highlight of the year was the financial closure of the Reko Diq copper-and-gold project in Balochistan, achieved nearly 15 years after completion of the feasibility study \u2014 including the six years lost to litigation. The $7 billion project is backed by a strong consortium of sponsors, including the International Finance Corporation, the Asian Development Bank, and financial institutions from the US, Canada, Japan, and Saudi Arabia.\nThough much has yet to be achieved on the social front, the year offered a boost not only to homegrown economics but also to Pakistan\u2019s international stature\nConstruction activity is expected to gather pace in early 2026 as well, with commercial production projected to begin in 2028, potentially generating around $2.5bn annually in export earnings.\nAfter a hiatus of nearly two decades, Pakistan has revived its long-stalled privatisation agenda, starting with the sale of the debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to aprivate consortium.\nFor years, PIA stood as a symbol of chronic mismanagement, political interference, and persistent fiscal hemorrhaging, with accumulated losses estimated at more than $2.5bn, imposing a heavy and recurrent burden on the national exchequer. The transaction represents a notable policy inflection, signalling the government\u2019s readiness to take politically difficult decisions to curb losses, restore efficiency, and progressively reduce the state\u2019s footprint in commercial activity.\nMoreover, Pakistan\u2019s stock market continued a stunning surge in 2025, with the KSE-100 Index beating all previous records to an all-time high of over 170,000 points and earning a place among the world\u2019s top-performing markets.Bloombergranked Pakistan \u201camong the best-performing markets globally,\u201d noting that its returns outpaced nearly every major index. Barron\u2019s went a step further, hailing the turnaround as a rare \u201cmini miracle,\u201d fuelled by reforms, macroeconomic stabilisation, and a decisive return of investor confidence.\nYet, the year was not without setbacks. Agricultural growth suffered a sharp downturn, falling from 6.4pc in FY24 to just 1.5pc in FY25. Major crops were severely affected, including cotton declining by over 30pc, maize by 15pc, and wheat by 9pc. This contraction slowed the anticipated reduction in poverty rates and underscored the continued vulnerability of the agricultural sector.\nAnother low point was Pakistan\u2019s unemployment rate, whichroseto 7.1pc in FY25, the highest level in 21 years, underscoring the economy\u2019s failure to generate productive jobs. Compared to 64pc males, only 18pc females are employed as per the Labor Force Survey. Six in 10 Master\u2019s-degree-holder women are not currently employed. The combination of high unemployment and widespread unpaid work highlights the urgency of growth strategies that can create decent, paid jobs, especially for women and youth, and convert hidden labour into productive economic participation.\nPerhaps the lowest point for Pakistan is its fall to the very bottom of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Gender Gap Index 2025, ranking 148 out of 148 countries. This stark outcome signals a clear deterioration in women\u2019s economic participation, widening wage inequality, and an alarmingly weak presence of women in decision-making.\nPakistan\u2019s poor performance is the result of structural constraints such as persistent barriers to women\u2019s entry into the economy and governance, weak implementation of gender-inclusive policies, and entrenched sociocultural norms.\nThe writer is a member of the Steering Committee for the implementation of the National Tariff Policy 2025-30.

      "fullText": "AS another year ends, it is worth looking back and taking stock of significant developments in Pakistan\u2019s education sector. While many small-scale interventions and pilot projects are ongoing, I will restrict my review to wide-scale developments that are more likely to have a perceptible impact, good or bad.\nThe widely quoted figure of25 million out-of-school children, the one that prompted this government to announce an \u201ceducation emergency,\u201d has been bumped up to an estimated 26m. Meanwhile, public spending on education remains stuck at 0.8 per cent of GDP. Instead, according to a news report just this week, the government\u2019s best idea is to gently twist private businesses\u2019 arm to make them pledge one per cent of their profits for the cause of education, presumably because levied taxes (paid or evaded) and additional costs of doing business in this country are not high enough. Never has a country, certainly no country of a quarter billion souls, righted its ship of public education on the back of corporate charitable giving.\nFor a positive development, the national Inter Boards Coordination Commission (IBCC)announceda notable increase in flexibility. SSC and HSSC students will now be able to select individual subjects, instead of being restricted to pre-set tracks, i.e. arts, (general) science, pre-engineering, and pre-medical, like in many other foreign school systems. Students advancing to HSSC will not be constrained in their choice by what SSC subjects they took, i.e. anyone who opted for arts subjects at the SSC level could still take subjects needed for admission to medical or engineering programmes. It may require catching up in some subjects, but it will be an option. It is a welcome development, because how certain can we expect 14-year-olds starting SSC or 16-year-olds starting HSSC to be about the future course of their academic year?\nA widely debated development is the Punjab government\u2019s ongoingprivatisationof a large portion of its 48,000 public schools. So far, the management of 12,500 public primary and middle schools has already been transferred to private entities, primarily education sector NGOs, with another 4,500 announced in the upcoming phase, which, for the first time, will include 70 of the province\u2019s 550 inter colleges. Students at schools with low enrolment have been reassigned to nearby schools. Similarly, teachers have been transferred to other schools or placed in the surplus pool. Unsurprisingly, there is pushback from teacher unions, but schools do not exist solely for the purpose of providing livelihoods for teachers. What we know for certain is that, for decades, most public schools have failed to deliver on their mission of educating children and that successive governments have been unable to reverse the decline. It was high-time for a radical change, and I look forward to seeing the outcome evaluations of this programme.\nNever has a country righted its ship of public education on the back of charity.\nSindh has decided to go a different route to deal with its inability to improve public school education and announced the introduction of IGCSE / A-level education tracks in one public school of every district.\nA big development that almost was but did not come to pass, but may yet come to be, is the reversal of the devolution of education to provinces. The recentralisation of education as a subject to the centre was mentioned during early negotiations of the27th Amendment. Speculatively, while it is on the wish list, it was not high up enough on the list of priorities to be included in the ratified version. Now, there are rumours swirling about yet another, a 28th amendment, with the two key priorities of changing the NFC and bringing education back to the centre. While provinces are certainly expected to put up a fight on the issue of the NFC, having accomplished little to nothing in education since the 18th Amendment gave them control, they are expected to be glad for the federal government to take the responsibility of developing curricula off their hands.\nAnother important development affecting students seeking to study abroad has been the tightening of student visa requirements. Last month, the Institute of International Education\u2019s Fall 2025 snapshot report showed that in the US, enrolment of new international students is down by 17pcover last year. This drop has been attributed to the Trump administration\u2019s changes to student visa rules.\nIn the UK, similar measures have already led a few universities to suspend or significantly tighten admissions for applicants from Pakistan entirely. The Home Office tracks and limits the rate at which applications for student visas are rejected for every UK university to prevent abuse of the visa system by international students who overstay or apply for asylum. According to revised rules, universities whose student visa application rejectionswill exceed the 5pc thresholdwill lose the right to host international students. Since Pakistani students are counted among the biggest offenders, several universities no longer consider applicants from Pakistan. This is a case of bad actors ruining opportunities for all genuine applicants from the country.\nAny review of education news in 2025 must acknowledge the rapid advancement of AI. Tech execs of companies leading the AI revolution, thought leaders, and leading universities and school systems have not been able to converge on a consensus on how AI tools will be incorporated into learning and how it will change the sector as a whole.\nMeanwhile, in several conversations I had with people in the bureaucracy, in their infinite wisdom and foresight, they have already declared that AI-powered learning tools will sweep through schools and universities transforming the education sector as we know it, solving all problems and, having nothing to offer, are happy to fold their arms, lean back, and just watch as passive observers!\nIn conclusion, what is life without a little conflict, sentimentality, and betrayal of a soap opera? That is why I feel it necessary to acknowledge the low-level hubbub created every time an HEC chair steps down and the horse race of vice-chancellors for the replacement begins. The rumour is that the shortlist has been cut down to three candidates, and the announcement of who is going to be the next HEC chair is imminent. Until next year, we watch, wait, and hope that the next chapter brings more substance than spectacle.\nThe writer has a PhD in education.\nPublished in Dawn, December 25th, 2025",

      "fullText": "PAKISTAN\u2019S tax effort appears to have plateaued. Or so the latest IMF projections stress. After a jump of 1.4 percentage points in the tax-to-GDP ratio to 10.3pc in FY25, largely through additional revenue-enhancing measures that mostly burdened captive taxpayers \u2014 the salaried class and compliant businesses \u2014 the FBR tax collection as a ratio of the country\u2019s GDP is projected to stagnate for the next five years. The only modest gains, if any, will likely come from provinces, and that too if they decide to effectively tax agriculture income and services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to jump from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27 and further to 1.6pc in FY28 before flattening until FY30. Overall, the country\u2019s tax revenues are projected to flatten at 11.1pc of GDP \u2014 much below the 13.3pc mark the government has committed to achieve during the current IMF programme period \u2014 all the way through FY30. What the lender is signalling is that the government has \u2018exhausted\u2019 its option to raise taxation without fixing the underlying structural problems and better enforcement, or further burdening compliant sectors of the economy, or both.\nThe government\u2019s growing dependence on non-tax revenue to prop up its fiscal position should be particularly concerning. Though the total government revenues surged to nearly 16pc of GDP in FY25, this increase has not resulted from the expansion of the tax base but from heavy petroleum levy and the State Bank\u2019s profits. The levy has quietly morphed into a permanent quasi-tax on consumption in recent years, disproportionately burdening low-middle-income households. Another worrying fact is that Pakistan\u2019s inequitable tax policy, which is over- reliant on indirect taxes while under-taxing or not taxing certain powerful lobbies, is likely to persist at the expense of economic growth and investment. That Pakistan\u2019s economic growth depends on its ability to boost tax-to-GDP ratio is confirmed by cross-country evidence cited by the Fund: countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc \u2014 precisely where Pakistan has been for a while and appears destined to remain. In sum, faster economic growth will remain a pipe dream until fiscal consolidation is achieved through structural reforms instead of what many call stealth taxation.\nPublished in Dawn, December 24th, 2025",

      "fullText": "PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday urged giving the provinces a greater role in areas such as tax collection to help address the federal government\u2019s financial issues.\nThe Bhutto scion was addressing the death anniversary programme for his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Benazir wasassassinatedin a gun-and-bomb attack near Rawalpindi\u2019s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007, after a public gathering.\nThe Sindh government announced apublic holidaytoday to commemorate Benazir\u2019s death anniversary.Foolproof securityfor the VVIPs, VIPs, and general public was ensured in Larkana, with over 8,500 police officers and personnel, alongside Rangers and other security agencies, deployed at and around Bhutto\u2019s mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh.\nSpeaking at the event, Bilawal said the PPP was a federal party that conducted politics at both the national and provincial levels with sincerity, treating the Centre\u2019s problems as its own.\n\u201cIf there is an issue of fiscal space for the federal government, then as a patriot, I would want to help solve it. The PPP has its own politics and history, and as the chain binding the four provinces, we have a greater responsibility to address the Centre\u2019s issues while protecting provincial rights.\u201d\n\u201cWe think that instead of attempts to take authority away from the provinces, it would be better if the federal government gave more responsibilities to them. We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government\u2019s issues.\u201d\nPointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue.\n\u201cWe will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crises.\u201d\nBilawal maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces.\n\u201cWe will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan\u2019s economic problems together so we can improve the people\u2019s financial situation.\u201d\nOn his mother, Bilawal said her last message was one of reconciliation. He added that reconciliation would be necessary to resolve the country\u2019s current political crisis.\nThe Bhutto scion said that parties would have to abandon \u201cpolitical extremism\u201d for the reconciliation effort to succeed, and their supporters would need to bring politics back within bounds. He added that actions such as the May 9, 2023, nationwide riots or cursing institutional heads were not the way forward.\nHe said Benazir and the PPP had never pursued the politics of revenge, as it caused losses to the country, its people, and the party\u2019s supporters.\n\u201cPolitical forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.\u201d\nIn his speech, the president said today marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir\u2019s assassination.\nHe also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a \u201cbefitting response\u201d to the enemy, making it realise that it was serious.\n\u201cModi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.\u201d\nHe warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, \u201cthey should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation\u201d.\nIn an earliermessageon his wife\u2019s death anniversary, the president said: \u201cAs we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.\u201d\nHe stressed that Benazir \u201cnever believed in vindictiveness and vendetta\u201d.\n\u201cShe always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOn her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,\u201c he added.\nRecalling that Benazir was the first female prime minister of a Muslim country and had been elected twice to the role, Zardari said: \u201cIn a political landscape shaped by exclusion, patriarchy, longer authoritarian rule and repeated disruptions of democratic order, she stood like a rock for the supremacy of the Constitution, authority of the Parliament and the peoples\u2019 right to choose their representatives.\n\u201cHer repeated return to electoral politics reflected an unshakeable faith in peaceful political struggle and unadulterated democracy,\u201d he asserted.\n\u201cShe gave voice to the voiceless. She pulled farmers, workers and low-income families like a super magnet towards her, who remained at the centre of her politics,\u201d the president highlighted, pointing out Benazir\u2019s focus on widening access to livelihoods and education.\n\u201cShaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,\u201d President Zardari said about his late wife.\n\u201cHer courage in the face of extremism remains one of her most enduring legacies,\u201d he further said, adding that Benazir\u2019s assassination was a \u201creminder that the fight against terrorism is not only about security, but also about ideas, education and respect for diversity\u201d.\n\u201cFor the youth of Pakistan, her life offers a clear lesson. Speak up for justice, organise peacefully and do not surrender hope in the face of adversity. She confronted censorship and repression with resolve, proving that truth cannot be silenced forever.\u201d\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to her, saying her political legacy was marked by patriotism, courage, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values,Radio Pakistanreported.\nHe said she consistently promoted tolerance, harmony, and forbearance in the political process, which remained a guiding principle for strengthening democracy in the country.\nPM Shehbaz reaffirmed the government\u2019s resolve to continue the journey of tolerance, rule of law, democratic governance, and public welfare.\nBilawal, in amessagereleased by the PPP yesterday, said his mother\u2019s \u201csupreme sacrifice was a pledge written in blood that democracy in Pakistan would never surrender\u201d.\n\u201cShaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was not just a leader; she was the fearless voice of democracy, the hope of the oppressed and an unyielding symbol of resistance against dictatorship, extremism and intolerance,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\nReaffirming the PPP\u2019s unwavering commitment to Benazir\u2019s mission, Bilawal said the party will continue to fight for social and economic justice, constitutional supremacy, women\u2019s empowerment and the protection of minorities.\n\u201cWe bow our heads in reverence before Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Her sacrifice is our strength, her vision our guiding light and her courage our lasting responsibility. Her dream lives on in every voice raised for justice and every step taken for democracy,\u201d the PPP scion said.\nBilawal went on to say that Benazir\u2019s vision of a \u201cpeaceful, democratic and inclusive Pakistan continues to inspire generations, especially women and youth\u201d.\nHe noted that as the premier, his mother \u201cpursued people-centred policies, strengthened Pakistan\u2019s defence, safeguarded national sovereignty and restored the country\u2019s progressive and dignified image internationally\u201d.\nBenazir\u2018s daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, whopaid a visitto her mother\u2019s mausoleum yesterday, said on social media platform X: \u201cToday we remember Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.\n\u201cShe lived with courage and led with compassion. Her strength lives on in every voice that refuses injustice.\u201d\nAseefa further said, \u201cIn every struggle and every accomplishment, we think of you, miss you, and pray for you. We continue to strive to fulfil your vision and values. Your absence leaves us searching for the guidance only you could give.\u201d\nSenator Sherry Rehman posted a video message on her X account, saying that Benazir \u201cnever wavered, she never compromised on her dreams for her beloved Pakistan\u201d.\n\u201cDespite all threats, risks and real dangers, she did what she believed in. Her courage and resilience define her as one of the greatest leaders the world saw,\u201d Rehman said, adding that her vision lives on in the hands of Bilawal, Aseefa and President Zardari.\nMeanwhile, a government delegation led by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, has departed for Garhi Khuda Bakhsh to attend the gathering being held to mark Benazir\u2019s death anniversary.\nThe delegation, including Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, and MNAs, is attending on the special instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The delegation will also hold meetings with the PPP leadership.\nIn a statement released prior to his departure, Sadiq said, \u201cToday we are commemorating the death anniversary of Pakistan\u2019s great daughter, former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed.\u201d\nHe said Benazir had played a significant role in strengthening the role of women, adding she worked to make Pakistan a peaceful, progressive, and democratic state.\n\u201cHer sacrifices and services are a guiding light for the entire nation,\u201c he said.",

      "fullText": "\nThis year proved particularly harsh for Pakistan\u2019s agriculture sector. Government policies drove up input costs, reduced exports, and depressed domestic crop prices, whereas climate change adversely affected crop yields. Taken together, farmers of all major crops suffered badly.\nWheat prices fell by up to Rs2,000 per 40 kg when the government abruptly discontinued both the support price and procurement from farmers, without putting in place any alternative mechanisms to manage the annual supply glut during the harvest period. Likewise, cotton farm-gate prices declined due to an 18 per cent sales tax on locally produced cotton, selectively, whereas imports remained exempt until the end of July 2025.\nSimilarly, in 2025, the government scrapped its long-standing policy of announcing an indicative sugarcane price. As a result, sugar mills are paying farmers rates that neither align with crop expenses nor reflect prevailing sugar market prices.\nMaize and rice yields were hit by climate change, while their market prices were depressed by the closure of the Afghanistan border. The border disruption also severely curtailed exports of citrus, potatoes, and other crops to Afghanistan and Central Asian markets, triggering a considerable decline in domestic prices. Sesame proved to be another loss-making crop due to weak global prices and erratic rainfall.\nAn underwhelming seed sector, water insecurity and a narrow agri export market will pose challenges to the sector in the coming year\nIn 2025, farmers have lost much of their cost competitiveness due to higher input costs, policy failures, and weather vagaries. In view of all these, they are not very optimistic about 2026. Many fear that the situation could worsen further in the years ahead as new challenges have come into play.\nFirst, the government has recently assured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it will raise duties on fertilisers and pesticides \u2014 the two major cost components of crop production \u2014 if tax collection falls short. Such a move would sharply escalate production costs and could pose an existential threat to the agriculture sector.\nSecond, the intensity and frequency of erratic rainfalls and heat waves are rising, alongside increasing temperatures, which will continue to erode crop yields. With monsoon rainfall projected to rise by 22\u201326pc, floods are again feared in 2026. Yet, there is no visible improvement in flood preparedness or mitigation measures.\nThird, unlike many comparable countries that levy minimal or no taxation, Pakistan \u2014 under IMF directives \u2014 will raise the agricultural income tax from the existing 15pc to as high as 45pc, effective from FY26. Farmers, who are the primary investors in the sector, particularly for upgrading farm practices and mechanisation, will likely see their on-farm investments suppressed. This decision comes at a time when farm sizes are shrinking, and both crop production and market risks are intensifying due to climate change and price volatility.\nFourth, if the Afghanistan border remains closed into 2026, both raw and value-added products of many crops will face significant setbacks. Under current farming practices, the sector is ill-prepared to access alternative export markets and to comply with their stringent sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards. A prolonged border closure would therefore create widespread gluts in the country that would result in severe losses for farmers.\nFifth, earlier in the year, India unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty and disrupted the Chenab river flow by abruptly holding and releasing water. Such irregular flows badly affect the crops. Looking ahead, any future reduction in river flows \u2014 while Pakistan already struggles to distribute water equitably among provinces \u2014 could severely impact those regions that rely solely on canal water.\nIn such a precarious and fragile situation, the pressing question is: what is the way forward, and which targeted interventions are needed to stabilise the agriculture sector?\nMost importantly, the top priority should be to enhance farmers\u2019 access to high-yielding, climate-resilient seeds because higher productivity is the only viable way to partially offset rising production costs and heavier taxation. For this, Pakistan needs a dynamic seed sector where the public and private sector (national and multinational seed companies) undertake research and development and market their quality seed freely. However, this will require a highly robust seed regulatory mechanism.\nWater shortages pose an impending threat to Pakistan\u2019s agriculture. To offset potential reductions in river flows from India and Afghanistan \u2014 where several dams are in the pipeline \u2014 Pakistan must significantly expand its water storage capacity. Simultaneously, the widespread adoption of high-efficiency irrigation systems along with rainwater harvesting to recharge groundwater is essential, as reliance on groundwater is bound to increase in the coming years.\nPakistan must actively explore and tap into new export markets to manage its export surplus. However, to comply with their sanitary and phytosanitary standards, we need to upgrade our farm practices, which is far from easy. At the very least, export-oriented clusters can be developed in collaboration with the private sector, where crops \u2014 particularly high-value, non-traditional ones \u2014 are grown under contract farming arrangements and processed into value-added products.\nDespite these mounting challenges \u2014 directly affecting the country\u2019s food security, agricultural exports, employment generation, and poverty \u2014 the government\u2019s response remains confined to short-term, headline-friendly interventions such as small bank loans, ballot-based distribution of tractors, solar tubewells and farm implements, model agricultural malls, and short-term training of 1,000 agri-graduates in China, even as hundreds of highly qualified PhDs and MPhils remain unemployed in the country.\nWhat Pakistan urgently needs are focused and sustained investments in strengthening its seed sector, improving water resources, and upgrading on-farm practices to enhance yields and exports. However, given the ongoing political turmoil in the country and the government\u2019s preference for optics-driven quick wins, these critical priorities are unlikely to get due attention. Consequently, the agriculture sector would remain rudderless, without a clear vision or direction.\nKhalid Wattoo is a development professional and a farmer, and Dr Waqar Ahmad is a former Associate Professor at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 29th, 2025",

      "fullText": "\nTHERE has been another wave of criticism and an extensive campaign by local auto-assemblers and parts manufacturers over the increasing import of vehicles, particularly used cars brought in under the gift scheme. Despite the industry\u2019s vocal objections, demand for imported used vehicles continues to surge.\nThe massive appeal for used imported vehicles is not without valid reasons. Consumers widely believe these cars offer better reliability, features and safety compared to locally-assembled options. Industry protection measures, including high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, have existed for decades. Yet, even with this long-standing support, the local industry has struggled to achieve meaningful levels of true localisation.\nAccording to the latest State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, vehicle-related imports, both complete knocked-down (CKD) and complete built-up (CBU) versions, contribute heavily to foreign exchange outflows. Imports under HS Code 87 alone accounted for roughly $2 billion in 2024-25. In addition, substantial foreign exchange is spent on importing raw materials, such as steel sheets, plastics and chemical components, indicating that local value addition remains minimal. In contrast, used vehicles are a source of elusive forex reserves as well as a handsome amount of revenue that is collected as duties and taxes.\nWhile the government\u2019s import policy has traditionally favoured domestic manu-facturers through extensive protection and taxation, especially on fully built units, the demand to impose a blanket ban on used car imports raises questions of fairness.\nImported used vehicles consistently deliver better safety, durability and overall quality, areas where local assemblers continue to fall short. For consumers, these imports offer an alternative that pushes local producers to improve quality and price.\nToo much of everything is bad, and the same holds for the protection of auto- assembling and parts manufacturing units. For a long time, consumers have not been provided enough options locally. Previously, there used to be only three to four local giants. Although with the introduction of Chinese brands, the market has expanded with new models, it needs to be seen how these companies will cope with the introduction of new energy vehicles (NEVs) instead of relying on technologies that are decade old.\nIt is a fact that a CBU imported car will always be cheaper than a car assembled as CKD. An NEV, hybrid or EV, would always have lesser impact on forex outflows unless we attain 80-90 per cent localisation, or we are strong enough to export. Given our track record, both scenarios remain highly unlikely. Experts also note that allowing commercial imports will not address consumer affordability. Although it may serve as a non-tariff barrier, it is unlikely to influence car prices in the domestic market in any meaningful way.\nThe government should not succumb to threats, propaganda and campaigns of auto-assemblers and parts manufacturers. Some sort of pressure should always be there to reap the true benefits of competitiveness, which may ultimately provide some sort of relief for customers and local industry.\nAftab A.

      "fullText": "Meaningful relief for compliant income tax payers, salaried individuals and the corporate sector \u2014 who together contribute roughly half of Pakistan\u2019s revenues \u2014 appears unlikely. Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead.\nTo avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy.\nThose who trust the Federal Board of Revenue\u2019s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure.\nIn 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government\u2019s economic team\u2019s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF.\nA recent media report indicates that the IMF, which is closely monitoring Pakistan\u2019s economic trajectory, also expects tax collection to remain broadly stagnant in CY26.\nThere appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best\nFrom 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratioroseto 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27.\nFBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal.\nMusadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. \u201cBoth the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.\u201d\nDr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. \u201cAt best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,\u201d he said.\nA source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. \u201cI support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF\u2019s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.\u201d\nDr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. \u201cSubstantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.\u201d\nHe also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand.\nCovering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential.\nFormer federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan\u2019s economic discourse. \u201cAll we hear is \u2018tax, tax, tax\u2019, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,\u201d he remarked.\nRehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. \u201cThere is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF\u2019s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor.\n\u201cI expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.\u201d\nChairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 29th, 2025",

      "fullText": "Buying gifts for men should be easy, right? You walk into a store, grab something in leather or metal \u2014 a wallet, a watch, maybe a bottle of perfume that smells \u201cfresh and manly\u201d, and you\u2019re done. Safe, predictable, problem solved.\nExcept, it\u2019s not. Because when it comes to gifting men, there\u2019s this generic paradox. Everyone thinks it\u2019s simple, yet most men end up with things they neither want nor use.\nWell, we all know the holy trinity of male gifts \u2014 watches, perfumes, and shoes, but perhaps it\u2019s time to retire them. So, we decided to ask a few men what they actually want as gifts. The answers were funny, practical, a little bitter, and somewhat relatable.\nZareef, a part-time cartoonist, began his confession with dry honesty: \u201cI often don\u2019t get gifts. But not getting gifts doesn\u2019t bother me much. What bothers me is getting gifts I can\u2019t use, like fancy mugs or flashy ties. I already have seven fancy mugs gathering dust, and a yellow tie that screams, \u2018Fashion nightmare.\u2019 Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t wear it even if it paid rent.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s Sirajis, a 35-year-old professor, who spoke for an entire demographic of overworked, under-rested men. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019d love someone to pay my electricity bill for a month. That would be a real gift.\u201d\nNow, that might sound absurd at first. A bill! As a present? But in a world where adulthood feels like a recurring tax, it\u2019s actually poetic. Nothing says love like financial relief.\nOthers, however, were more direct about their preferences. \u201cRather than giving me the wrong gift,\u201d said Imran, a marketing executive, \u201cjust give me money. I\u2019ll buy what I want. Saves both of us disappointment.\u201d\nFair point. Sentiment is nice, but practicality pays Imran\u2019s rent.\nHowever, Hasan, a writer and journalist, shared a story that perfectly captures the quiet fatigue of modern manhood. \u201cOnce, my wife took me Eid shopping to buy me gifts because me not getting gifts makes her sad. After making me walk the whole market, she bought me a few things that she thinks I should love. And, honestly, letting me stay at home and relax for an evening would have been my gift.\u201d\nYou can almost hear every husband in the country nodding in solidarity.\nThen there\u2019s Imtiaz, who spoke from a gentler, more introspective place. \u201cBeing the breadwinner, I often like things here and there, maybe online or at a shop, but I don\u2019t buy them because I try to be responsible. But if someone close to me notices that and buys me that one thing, that would be my kind of gift. I\u2019d love that.\u201d\nThat might be the truest expression of what men actually want: to be noticed. Not the showy kind of attention, but the quiet understanding that someone sees their small desires, the ones they silently sacrifice for responsibility.\nAnd finally, perhaps the most honest take came from Farhan, who grinned as he said, \u201cIf my wife really wants to gift me something I\u2019d absolutely love, it would be a boys\u2019 trip with my school friends. Because with the boys, it\u2019s cheaper, less responsibility, and more fun.\u201d\nNo ties, no perfumes, no shopping \u2014 just a weekend of laughter and irresponsibility. The dream!\nWhat\u2019s interesting, though, is that not all men fit the stereotype of being emotionally indifferent to gifts. Some genuinely enjoy receiving them \u2014 even flowers.\n\u201cI once got flowers from a friend on my birthday,\u201d shared Ratul, a university student. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it, but it felt nice. Men, often, don\u2019t say it much, but we like being thought of too.\u201d\nAnd there lies the quiet truth behind the jokes \u2014 men aren\u2019t \u201cbad at gifts\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t care about them.\u201d They\u2019ve just been taught to act like they don\u2019t. Society\u2019s script has long told men to provide, not to receive. To buy gifts, not to deserve them.\nFrom mugs to money to mental peace, one thing becomes clear: men don\u2019t crave things as much as they crave thought. A gift that says, \u201cI see you, I know what you like, and you don\u2019t have to worry or pretend.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t like surprises. They just prefer the kind that makes their lives easier. A thoughtful book. A gadget they\u2019ve been eyeing. A meal they didn\u2019t have to pay for. \u00a0Because in the end, the best gifts for men aren\u2019t wrapped in paper. They\u2019re wrapped in understanding, practicality, and occasionally, the promise of a quiet evening with a plate of tahiri.\nThis article was originallypublishedon The Daily Star, an ANN partner of Dawn.\nHeader image: Man holding a small gift in his hands. \u2014 Chao-ye/ Pixabay",

      "fullText": "ONE swallow does not make a summer. Does it? Thesaleof PIA has fetched the government much praise \u2014 if not much cash. Simultaneously, it has stirred hopes that the first major privatisation in more than two decades would pave the way for the disinvestment of the other white elephants, sooner than later.\nMany expect the transaction to help revive investor confidence, with foreign private parties potentially lining up to invest in the country or acquire other loss-making state assets on the chopping block. Indeed, PIA\u2019s sale makes a strong case for the government to forge ahead with its privatisationagenda, while taking advantage of the feel-good sentiment this transaction has sparked.\nFor Pakistan, privatisation of state-owned enterprises no longer signifies an ideological choice but an economic necessity. Most SOEs, like the national flag carrier, are a heavy burden on the budget with their combined losses running into hundreds of billions of rupees every year at the taxpayers\u2019 expense. Needless to say these losses are squeezing funds that could be used to build hospitals and schools, distorting markets and undermining public services delivery.\nWhile it is critical to sustain this momentum if the government is to durably stabilise its budget and create some fiscal space for development, this will not happen automatically. Nor will the PIA sale help restore investor interest any time soon. The process of privatisation is going to be long and demands painful structural reforms to actually boost business sentiment in the country.\nIn recent years we have seen dozens of foreign companiesexitthe Pakistan market due to tough economic conditions, exchange rate volatility, difficulties in profit repatriation, policy unpredictability, poor regulatory environment, heavy tax burden, and delays in settlement of commercial disputes. On top of that, high energy costs and disruptions in supply chains due to foreign exchange restrictions have further eroded competitiveness and business confidence in recent years.\nLocal investors too are not very bullish on fresh investment, at least not for the moment. The absence of foreign investors from the PIA auction shows reluctance on their part to become part of Pakistan\u2019s economy in any way. Even local investors, who won the bid, had to rope in Fauji Fertiliser for institutional protection to hedge against any future policy reversals or adverse actions.\nIf privatisation is to succeed, the government must move decisively on multiple fronts: strengthen regulators for effective governance, guarantee policy continuity, broaden tax base, alleviate burden on compliant businesses, ensure rule of law for quicker settlement of commercial disputes, reduce cost of doing business etc. Without these structural reforms, individual transactions like PIA may succeed once in a while, but the broader privatisation agenda will continue to stall.\nPerhaps, this is the time for the government to seize the opportunity to undertake structural reforms that have long prevented Pakistan from attracting direct foreign private investment.\nPublished in Dawn, December 28th, 2025",

Key stakeholders now hope the International Monetary Fund (IMF) willrecognisethe centrality of economic expansion to durable stabilisation and ease pressure on the government, allowing it fiscal space to recalibrate its tax policy.\nThey contend that only such flexibility can unshackle the country\u2019s economic potential and unlock its vast productive capacity.\nUnder the IMF oversight and a strict focus on fiscal stabilisation, Pakistan\u2019s tax collection has risen sharply over the past two years.\nAccording to the State Bank, tax revenuegrewby a notable 12.5 per cent year-on-year in Q1FY26. However, despite repeated claims of broadening the tax base, tangible progress remains elusive.\n\u2018Out of the proposed Rs975bn package, the bulk of the relief may go to companies, with super tax potentially cut from 10pc to 5pc\u2019\nLarge sectors, including agriculture, wholesale, retail trade, real estate, and high-earning service providers such as lawyers, doctors, architects, artists, consultants, etc, continue to operate largely outside the tax net. As a result, the burden of additional revenue mobilisation has fallen disproportionately on those already within the tax system.\nThis pattern is also reflected in official publications. According to the \u201821st Edition of the Revenue Division Year Book 2025\u2019, the share of direct taxes in total taxes rose from 37.2pc in FY22 to 49.3pc in FY25. A review of the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 and related publications confirms that the government does not regularly publish a clean breakdown of the share of categories of direct taxpayers, such as corporations or salaried individuals, in total direct tax collection.\nHowever, the corporate sector is understood to account for around 65pc of direct tax collections. The salaried individuals, presumed to be captive taxpayers, whose taxes are deducted at source and who constitute less than 8pc of the labour force, are believed to be contributing far more than their proportional share to the tax take.\nAcknowledging that Pakistan\u2019s unusually high tax burden has become a drag on growth, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif reportedly directed his economic team last week to engage the IMF on a proposed Rs975 billion tax-relief package as a part of a strategy to spur job creation and capital formation.\n\u2018High taxation is the single biggest obstacle to investment, and we are hoping the IMF will approve the relief package\u2019\nThe package was crafted by one of the government\u2019s working groups, which included representatives from civil society and the private sector, to recommend tax structure reforms. The private-sector-led group on taxation, chaired by Shahzad Saleem, proposed phasing the relief over three years, with an estimated immediate cost of Rs600bn. The government, however, opted to seek the IMF\u2019s endorsement before proceeding with implementation.\nSenior members of the economic team were approached for comment, but no response was received by the time of filing. However, a source familiar with the deliberations said the prime minister\u2019s close advisors broadly support the tax panel\u2019s proposals, viewing them as critical for kick-starting growth.\n\u201cHigh taxation is the single biggest obstacle to investment, and we are hoping the IMF will approve the relief package,\u201d a senior official noted privately. \u201cWe have some fiscal space, with the fiscal deficit down from over 8pc to around 5pc, but we need the Fund\u2019s relaxation on the primary-surplus target to move ahead.\u201d\nResponding to a question on how much of the proposed relief targets the salaried class, former FBR chairman Shabbar Zaidi noted, \u201cThe maximum salary tax rate is proposed to be reduced by five percentage points. The impact will be no more than Rs30\u201340bn. So, out of a Rs975bn package, the bulk of the relief would go to companies. Super Tax is to be cut from 10pc to 5pc.\u201d He pointed out that the proposal contains no concrete measures to offset the resulting revenue shortfall.\nBusiness leaders serving on government working groups declined to comment under their engagement terms. However, former Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik endorsed the proposed tax relief, arguing that Pakistan\u2019s tax regime renders businesses uncompetitive and punishes the most tax-compliant. \u201cSalaried employees and formal-sector firms bear a crushing tax burden while large segments of the economy remain untaxed.\u201d\nHe warned that the high-tax approach under the 24th IMF programme is stifling investment, destroying jobs and accelerating skilled emigration, while repeated pledges to tax retailers, wholesalers, transporters, doctors, lawyers and salon operators have produced little progress.\n\u201cIn this context, tax cuts are not just desirable but essential. Proposed measures include lowering the corporate tax rate from 29pc to 25pc; bringing maximum individual and AOP rates down from 38\u201349pc to a rational 25pc; abolishing the super tax; removing taxes on inter-corporate dividends; cutting sales tax from 18pc to 15pc; and withdrawing the Capital Value Tax. The real challenge, as always, will be closing the fiscal gap and securing IMF approval,\u201d Mr Malik remarked.\n\u201cThat requires political will. The government must cut expenditure, fast-track privatisation, and phase in tax reductions over three years. Evidence shows that lower, predictable taxes stimulate investment, create jobs, and ultimately raise revenue. Pakistan cannot grow while choking its most productive sectors.\n\u201cAbove all, personal income tax rates need an immediate cut. Salaried workers have become the easiest target, taxed far beyond economic reality. Easing this burden is vital to restore confidence, stem the brain drain, and put the country on a sustainable growth path,\u201d he concluded.\nAbdul Aleem, Secretary General, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, supported a calibrated reduction in tax rates for both the corporate and salaried groups. He noted that publicly available details do not explain how the Rs975bn figure was derived or what share is intended for salaried taxpayers.\nHe believed that the IMF is broadly aligned with the proposed relief but urged the Ministry of Finance to clarify how the resulting revenue shortfall would be addressed.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 8th, 2025",

Bankers noted that dividend payouts to the federal government surged sharply in FY25, with around Rs2.7tr transferred to the national exchequer, providing significant fiscal relief.\nAnother SBPreportshows that banks\u2019 investments stood at Rs36.7tr by end-June 2025, underscoring that the bulk of domestic borrowing continues to come from the banking sector.\nRs672bn raised during 1HFY26 in contrast with Rs1.7tr debt retirement\nBanks say around 86 per cent of the fiscal deficit is financed through bank borrowing, a factor they believe contributes to weak liquidity flows to the private sector.\nIn FY25, about 91pc of Pakistan\u2019s total fiscal deficit was financed from domestic sources, with banks playing the dominant role.\nReliance on domestic banks has remained a persistent trend as external financing often falls short of targets.\nIn FY24, nearly 88pc of deficit financing was raised through domestic markets. FY23 was considered the most challenging year, when external financing pressures pushed the government to rely heavily on bank borrowing to bridge the fiscal gap.\nA World Bank report issued on Dec 19 said Pakistan\u2019s path to inclusive and sustainable growth requires stronger mobilisation of domestic resources and more efficient and transparent use of public funds.\nThe World Bank\u2019s Board of Executive Directors has approved$700min financing for the Pakistan Public Resources for Inclusive Development \u2013 Multiphase Programmatic Approach (PRID-MPA), a multi-year initiative aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability and service delivery.\nAccording to the report, the PRID-MPA will support federal and provincial reforms to mobilise domestic revenue, improve spending quality and leverage data and digital tools for better public services. The programme will provide up to $1.35bn in total financing, including $600m for federal programmes and $100m for Sindh.\n\u201cThe results-based design ensures that resources are only disbursed once programme objectives are achieved,\u201d the report said.\nPublished in Dawn, December 26th, 2025",

Big factories or companies may buy electricity directly from a producer, but they still need the grid wires to get it. The fee they pay for using those wires is called wheeling and grid charges.\nThe meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also decided to end future procurement of power generation capacity in the public sector and constituted an 18-member steering committee of federal and provincial bureaucrats to lead integrated energy planning (IEP) \u2014 a push to bring electricity, oil, gas and other energy planning under a single coordinated national approach.\nUnder the framework guidelines, 800MW of generation capacity would be sold through a competitive auction for five years. The quantum would gradually increase after the initial trial, subject to government approval.\nThe auction is being developed under CTBCM, a system in which power producers and buyers deal directly with each other, rather than the government acting as the main middleman. In plain words, electricity is bought and sold like a market, not fully controlled by the government.\nThe National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) would determine the wheeling and grid charges for bulk power consumers upon a uniform petition to be filed by the distribution companies under the guidance of the power division.\nAn indicative wheeling charge of about Rs12.55 per unit may come into force, although industrial consumers are contesting it as too high and rendering their products uncompetitive.\nThe guidelines require the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO) \u2014 a new entity created under the Power Division \u2014 to issue the auction process with Nepra\u2019s approval.\nISMO will issue an auction calendar and detailed procedures. The framework does not allow a minimum or maximum limit on bid prices (no \u201ccap\u201d or \u201cfloor\u201d), and the bid price is to remain fixed for one year.\nThe guidelines also delineate the roles and responsibilities for the implementing agencies, including Nepra, ISMO and auction participants, and govern the entire structure of the CTBCM.\nUnder the timelines agreed with the IMF, approval of these guidelines for auction was targeted for December and approval of uniform wheeling charges by Nepra in January 2026.\nAn official statement said the resident committee of the top civil-military forum \u2014 the Special Investment Facilitation Council \u2014 had decided to have an integrated energy plan through federal and provincial coordination under the umbrella of the Power Division of the Ministry of Energy.\n\u201cA consequential determination has been reached regarding electricity wheeling within the country, thereby laying the foundation for the inception and advancement of a competitive energy market,\u201d an official statement said, adding that approvals had been extended to the competitive bidding process, participant engagement and other pertinent aspects.\nThis encompasses auth\u00ador\u00adisation for the CTBCM framework pertaining to electricity auctions, it said, adding that \u201cconsistent with the government\u2019s pledges, no further electricity procurement agreements shall be entered into\u201d, formally disengaging the government from electricity procurement activities.\nThe clearance for IEP governance by the Cabinet Committee on Energy on Wednesday would be followed by the notification of an IEP steering committee before the close of the current month.\nNext, the cabinet committee will approve IEP\u2019s high-level design by February 2026, to be followed by its model workshops across the country by October 2026, leading to formal approval of the National Integrated Energy Plan (NIEP) by the committee by April 2027.\nThe IEP steering committee, led by the power minister and co-chaired by the petroleum minister, would comprise about nine federal secretaries, four provincial chief secretaries and the chairpersons of Nepra, Ogra and Wapda.\nThe committee would ensure wide participation of relevant stakeholders for IEP and facilitate its implementation through the resolution of inter-sectoral, federal and provincial departmental issues and align it with national development priorities, including net-zero transitions.\nThe Cabinet Committee on Energy also directed the development and institutionalisation of the Energy Information System by the Power Division through its Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) to provide data-based decision-making support to the government, including the \u201cIEP Ecosystem\u201d.\nThe EIS will cover capacity building, governance improvements, monitoring, policy formulation, integration of plans and policies, modelling and scenario-based planning. It added that planning activities would be executed in a unified manner through a single entity, PPMC.\nThe NIEP is expected to adopt a cross-sector approach, covering oil, gas, coal, water and hydropower, minerals, natural resources and renewables on the supply side, and residential, commercial, industrial, transport and agriculture needs on the demand side.\nThe plan is also expected to gradually incorporate an artificial intellgence-based decision-support system to create a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d and avoid conflicting figures across institutions.\nPublished in Dawn, December 25th, 2025",

ADB\u2019s total debt stock currently stands at $17bn, the third largest after China and the World Bank.\nInformed sources toldDawnthat the minister proposed that the Manila-based lending agency should come up with financing instruments and arrangements that could directly make power sector debt more affordable through longer payback period and cheaper interest rates than commercial financing from the market. The ADB\u2019s financing and other instruments could also be leveraged to prolong debt-repayment periods.\nThis would enable the government to avoid budgetary injections and instead finance debt repayments through power tariff at lower than existing rates and help revive power consumption that had been struggling to pickup for years due to unaffordable electricity rates and resultant expansion of the solar revolution, leading to stability challenges to the national grid and power utilities.\nGovt requests lender to help stabilise national grid, improve debt affordability, foster private investment\nThe government had recentlycontractedaround Rs1.25tr from local commercial banks at Kibor minus 0.9pc to replace previous debts but the central bank\u2019s policy rate has since dropped with a similar pathway projects going ahead. The new debt is being financed through a permanent Rs3.23 per unit debt servicing surcharge on consumers. The government team also sought additional financing for smart metering expansion across distribution companies.\nThe minister also made a case for increased external support for Pakistan\u2019s contribution towards lowering carbon footprint through solar revolution in the country that had also created challenges to the grid stability. The government team argued that combination of financial support for cheaper debt swaps, smart metering and global environmental contribution could significantly reduce average power rates and help stabilise system through new technologies and demand growth for grid supply.\nAn official statement confirmed that Mr Leghari \u201csought ADB\u2019s support in addressing power sector debt repayment challenges, and in building confidence among private investors\u201d and briefed the delegation on key challenges facing the power sector.\n\u201cHe highlighted constraints in financing, issues related to rupee cover, and high upfront costs,\u201d the statement said, adding that the government was engaging local investors through the Pakistan Business Council to attract private investment in the power transmission sector and to improve market visibility.\nThe minister also explained to the ADB that under the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), excess power capacity which was not required in the future had been removed and the government will not procure additional power as it was now moving towards a competitive electricity market.\nHe said Pakistan had already transitioned around 20GW to clean energy. \u201cHowever, despite this significant transition, no dedicated financing was provided for the clean energy shift, nor was funding made available to ensure grid stability,\u201d he was quoted as saying, adding that the transition to renewable energy continued despite these limitations.\nHe emphasised that serious and coordinated efforts, supported by adequate financing, were now required to keep the grid stable. The ADB team was also apprised about the details of the recently introduced Energy Surplus Package to increase electricity demand and encourage higher power offtake by the private sector.\n\u201cHe requested ADB\u2019s support on the financing side, particularly in addressing debt repayment challenges, and in building confidence among private investors,\u201d the statement said.\nThe minister promised that a feasibility report aimed at private investors will be presented soon.\nHe also shared that the government was planning the rollout of smart meters through the private sector participation under public-private partnership model, with a focus on technology integration and improved efficiency.\nPublished in Dawn, December 18th, 2025",

We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government\u2019s issues.\u201d\nPointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue.\n\u201cWe will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crisis.\u201d\nHe maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces.\n\u201cWe will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan\u2019s economic problems together so we can improve the people\u2019s financial situation.\u201d\n\u2018Internal challenges\u2019\nReferring to the security situation, the PPP chairman said that in May this year Pakistan\u2019s armed forces defeated India on the battlefield, calling it a victory for the entire nation that had enhanced Pakistan\u2019s global standing. He, however, acknowledged that Pakistan continued to face serious internal challenges, including economic hardship, terrorism, security concerns and political instability, but reiterated the PPP\u2019s resolve to steer the country out of these crises.\nHe stressed that Pakistan could not overcome the economic crisis without first resolving the political crisis. Recalling Shaheed Benazir Bhutto\u2019s final message of reconciliation, he said political extremism must be abandoned and all political actors must return to the democratic fold.\n\u201cPolitical forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.\u201d\nAddressing public grievances, particularly in Hyderabad and Sukkur, he pledged that PPP would work with the federal government to resolve civic issues. On the economic front, he acknowledged that despite claims of recovery, the public had yet to feel the impact of growth, as inflation, unemployment and poverty continued to affect daily life. He said rising electricity and gas bills, education costs, medical expenses and household expenditures had eroded people\u2019s purchasing power.\nReferring to the plight of farmers after floods, he said the PPP had urged the prime minister to announce an agricultural emergency and thanked the Sindh chief minister for providing relief to farmers owning up to 25 acres through tax and input subsidies.\nOn education, he said the PPP aspired to provide youth from remote areas with the opportunity to study at top global institutions, adding that the Balochistan government had launched a scholarship programme to support deserving students.\nZardari lauds forces\nIn his address, President Asif Ali Zardari said today (Dec 27) marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir\u2019s assassination. He also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a \u201cbefitting response\u201d to the enemy, making it realise that Pakistan was serious.\n\u201cModi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.\u201d He warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, \u201cthey should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation\u201d.\nIn an earlier message, the president said, \u201cAs we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.\u201d\nHe stressed that Benazir \u201cnever believed in vindictiveness and vendetta\u201d.\n\u201cShe always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,\u201d he said. \u201cOn her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,\u201d he added. \u201cShaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,\u201d President Zardari said about his late wife.\nPublished in Dawn, December 28th, 2025",

      "fullText": "AS we close 2025, it is time to take a hard and honest look at the lay of the land of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\nNearly 78 years after independence, Pakistan\u2019s politics remains deeply unsettled. Of these years, approximately 33 were spent under four periods of direct military rule, with the remainder under various shades of indirect or hybrid regimes. It took 23 years for the country to hold its first general elections. To date, Pakistan has had 29 prime ministers \u2014 including caretakers and repeat tenures \u2014 yet not a single one has completed a full five-year constitutional term.\nDecline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and reversible.\nPakistan\u2019s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, wasassassinatedin 1951. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto wasexecutedin 1979. Benazir Bhutto wasassassinatedin 2007. Former PM Imran Khan has been incarcerated for nearly two years and sentenced to a cumulative 51 years.\nExternally, Pakistan has fought four major wars with India \u2014 in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999 \u2014 and continues to experience border tensions, including earlier this year in May. The dismemberment of the country in 1971 remains a major national trauma. In 1998, Pakistan became one of the world\u2019s nine nuclear-armed states.\nDemographic pressures have compounded these challenges.\nIn 1947, West Pakistan\u2019s population was approximately 32.7 million; today Pakistan\u2019s population is close to 250m. East Pakistan, with a population of around 40m in 1947, as Bangladesh is now roughly 177m people. Pakistan\u2019s population growth has outpaced its ability to govern, grow, educate, employ, and provide basic services.\nThe key determinants of national development \u2014 political stability, governance, respect for the Constitution and rule of law, inclusive institutions, economic growth, security, corruption control, and quality of life \u2014 are all in visible decline.\nPolitically, Pakistan lurches from one crisis to another. The current conflict is among the most serious in recent history. Since the tragic events of May 9, 2023, political polarisation has only intensified. At the heart of this crisis lies the unresolved question of civil-military relations.\nSecurity challenges further darken the picture. Cross-border terrorism is on the rise, insurgency continues in Balochistan, and relations with neighbouring countries have deteriorated, including now Afghanistan.\nGovernance failures are equally stark.\nFollowing the 18th Constitutional Amendment, provinces were granted authority and resources to manage policing, infrastructure, water and sanitation, health, education, and local governments. Yet provincial governments have largely failed to deliver.\nLocal government elections are routinely delayed or avoided to prevent the devolution of power and resources. Instead, development funds are distributed through MNAs and MPAs, fostering patronage, inefficiency, and corruption.\nDespite long tenures \u2014 PPP in Sindh since 2008, PTI in KP since 2013, and repeated PML-N governments in Punjab over decades \u2014 the quality of governance and service delivery remains dismal. In southern Punjab and other marginalised regions, conditions are particularly dire.\nThe Constitution itself has been weakened. Politically motivated amendments, notably the 26th and 27th, have eroded judicial independence. Fundamental rights guaranteed under Part II, Chapter One of the Constitution are routinely violated, as are the Principles of Policy outlined in Chapter Two. Laws such as PECA, 2016, are increasingly used to suppress dissent.\nThe erosion of the rule of law is reflected in global rankings. The World Justice Project defines the rule of law as the foundation of justice, opportunity, and peace. In its 2024 index covering 143 countries, Pakistan scored 0.37,ranking 130thoverall. Among South Asian countries, only Afghanistan ranks lower. Most alarming is Pakistan\u2019s last-place ranking \u2014 143 out of 143 \u2014 in the \u201corder and security\u201d category.\nEconomically, the situation is grim. Pakistan\u2019s average growth rate over the past three years stands at just 1.7 per cent \u2014 the lowest for any three consecutive years in the country\u2019s history. Approximately 45pc of the population lives below or near the poverty line, while unofficial unemployment assessment is at 22pc. This means nearly every second Pakistani is poor or near-poor, every fourth citizen is unemployed, and youth unemployment is even higher. Inflation over the past three to four years has reduced purchasing power by an estimated 65pc.\nTaxation levels are among the highest in the world, with salaried classes bearing a disproportionate brunt. Corporations face effective tax rates of around 60pc, while electricity tariffs are higher than in most comparable countries. The cost of doing business has become prohibitively high, driving companies out of Pakistan and depressing investment to historic lows, despite official claims that the economy has \u2018stabilised.\u2019\nPakistan\u2019s Human Development Index ranking has steadily worsened over the past decade. In 2024, Pakistan ranked 168 out of 193 countries, with all South Asian states except Afghanistan performing better. Health and education systems are in crisis: 40pc of children are stunted, and an estimated 40pc of school-age children are out of school. Pakistan ranks among the worst globally for neonatal mortality, hepatitis C prevalence, and type-II diabetes, and remains one of only two countries where polio has not been eradicated.\nWomen \u2014 half the population \u2014 continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and lack of voice. In the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report 2025,Pakistan ranked last: 148 out of 148 countries.\nThis is the sobering reality as 2025 draws to a close. But decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and therefore reversible.\nHistory offers perspective. In 1965, Pakistan\u2019s GDP per capita was comparable to that of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea. Today, all are far ahead. In the 1990s, Pakistan was South Asia\u2019s richest country and ranked above both India and Bangladesh on the Human Development Index. Many of these countries faced deep political and economic crises, yet emerged through sustained reforms, institutional strengthening, and political consensus.\nCredible economists now agree that Pakistan\u2019s current economic model is unsustainable. Yet recovery remains possible \u2014 if the country undertakes fundamental shifts in governance, economic policy, and institutional integrity.\nUltimately, everything hinges on politics. Without resolving the present political conflict and its underlying causes, no economic or social reform can sustainably succeed. Pakistan urgently needs a broad national consensus on a new direction. As the new year approaches, such consensus appears distressingly distant.\nThe writer is a former SAPM on health with ministerial status, adjunct professor of health systems and president of the Pakistan Association of Lifestyle Medicine.\nPublished in Dawn, December 26th, 2025",

The allocation for 2025-26 is Rs104.7bn, with an additional demand of around Rs175bn indicated during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.\nWhile reviewing Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) projects in the power and hydel energy sectors, the minister also asked ministries to work out the minimum annual PSDP allocations required to complete these schemes within stipulated timelines.\nChairing a meeting, Mr Iqbal was briefed on the overall portfolio and financial position of major power and hydel projects. A total of 37 critical power sector schemes, with a combined approved cost of Rs1.7 trillion, were reviewed.\nThe minister said periodic portfolio reviews were essential to ensure scarce public resources were aligned with national priorities, cost overruns and implementation delays were identified early, and projects with the highest economic and social returns were completed without slippages.\nMinistries told to finalise three-year framework, funding requirements\nHe asked the secretaries of the planning, finance, economic affairs, power and water resources ministries to jointly identify financial, technical and administrative bottlenecks and resolve them on a fast-track basis through coordinated action and stakeholder engagement.\nA disciplined three-year rolling plan, Mr Iqbal said, would help avoid the accumulation of incomplete projects, contain fiscal pressures and translate public investment into tangible gains in energy security and economic growth.\nThe minister instructed the Power Division to prioritise near-completion projects, rationalise future financing and put in place a realistic three-year execution framework, along with PSDP funding requirements, to ensure timely delivery of strategically important schemes.\nHe also directed the division to submit a project-wise break-up of critical schemes, along with annual financing and execution plans for the next three years. Near-completion projects, he said, must be prioritised so that sunk investments could be converted into operational assets at the earliest.\n\u201cThe objective is to reduce the throw-forward and complete priority projects within defined timelines,\u201d Mr Iqbal said, noting that delays escalated costs and deferred economic benefits such as improved energy availability, industrial productivity and investor confidence.\nPublished in Dawn, December 30th, 2025",

He emphasised technology adoption, managerial capacity, and SME formalisation to strengthen competitiveness.\nHighlighting digital transformation, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh said that digital technologies, artificial intelligence, and fintech can enable Pakistan to leapfrog economically, provided adoption moves from pilot projects to large-scale platforms.\nReferring to improving market sentiment, the investment minister noted that rising investor confidence reflected in the stock market performance indicates growing trust in Pakistan\u2019s economic direction.\nReaffirming the prime minister\u2019s vision, he stated that the government is implementing investor-friendly reforms to improve ease of doing business and ensure regulatory predictability.\nThe minister informed investors that special economic zones offer a ten-year income tax exemption, while around 6,000 acres of land are available near Port Qasim for investment purposes. He further highlighted that the Business Facilitation Centre is providing one-window solutions to domestic and foreign investors.\nHe concluded by reiterating that the Board of Investment remains committed to providing all possible facilitation to foreign investors and positioning Pakistan as a competitive, reliable, and future-ready investment destination.\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "fullText": "\nThe outlook for a consensus on the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) award currently appears murky within set timelines, both in cases of vertical and horizontal resource distribution as well as sharing of expenditures among the stakeholders.\nSo far, the working groups, according to a media report, have made limited progress, which, as per the report, makes it difficult for the consolidation of their recommendations within the time frame. The commission was due to meet in January.\nDespite the tough challenges they face, it is incumbent on all stakeholders to join hands to achieve a consensus on the new NFC award, upholding the rights of the federating units.\nNo doubt, the eight working groups set up by the federal government include issues with no easy solutions. They will recommend the percentage of resources to be distributed between the centre and the four provinces, the vertical transfers, national debt composition and its utilisation, and the inclusion or exclusion of certain taxes in the divisible pool.\nProvincial representatives insist on greater autonomy, citing increased tax revenue collection over the past year, even as the NFC award continues to be delayed\nThe centre, says a The Express Tribune analyst, wants to exclude customs duties from the purview of the divisible pool that is divided among the five governments. According to the Revenue Division Year Book 2025, the provisional net total collection of customs duty by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was Rs1.28 trillion in FY25 or 10.9pc of the total tax revenue.\nSimilarly, in the NFC group meeting on the sharing of divisible pool resources for the federally administered tribal districts merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), the KP government has reportedly proposed the creation of a 10-year special grant from the federal divisible pool to address what it described as \u201chistorical development deficits\u201d in the merged area. The grant, officials said, would bring the region on a par with the rest of KP and the country. However, the federal government says the province is getting its due share.\nThe International Monetary Fund projects Pakistan\u2019s provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to rise from 0.9pc in FY25 to 1.6pc by FY28, with total collections expected to exceed Rs3.1tr by FY30. The federal tax revenue is expected to remain largely flat during this period. The Fund says the future revenue growth will be driven mainly by provinces.\nHowever, the Fund notes that this provincial revenue increase is contingent on the successful rollout of agricultural income tax (AIT) reforms and an expanded sales tax on services.Significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, including fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities.\nFormer FBR chairman Syed Shabbar Zaidi says the exemption from the levy of Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act 2011 should be removed, and all retailers and wholesalers should be subjected to taxation under the Act. The jurisdiction of the Federal Sales Tax Act 1990 should end, and registration of such retailers and wholesalers should be transferred to the provinces.\nThe Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) has posted a robust half-yearly growth of 21pc for FY26 by collecting Rs161.4bn compared to Rs133.3bn in FY25. In December, SRB recorded a surge in revenues by 25pc.\nAnd on Dec 9, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had urged the government to transfer the collection of sales tax on goods to the provinces, saying the provinces have proven their capacity to take the lead in collecting the sales tax on services after the 18th Amendment.\nAccording to the Revenue Division Year Book, the total net sales tax collection was provisionally estimated at Rs3.9tr for FY25 or 33.2pc of the federal tax revenue.\nA working group chaired by KP\u2019s Finance Minister will now \u201cdeliberate and suggest measures for improving the overall tax-to-GDP ratio\u201d. Notable here is that the KP Revenue Authority recorded a 30pc increase in collection of sales tax on services amounting to Rs23.3bn during the first six months of this fiscal year compared to Rs17.9bn in the same period last year.\nThe Centre has been levying presumptive taxes on services under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, sales tax on gas, electricity and telephone services and federal excise duty on several services, according to analysts Huzaima Bokhari, Dr Ikramul Haq and Abdul Rauf Shakoori. In a joint Business Recorder article, they wrote that the present situation on the financial front could have been avoided had the centre allowed the provinces to generate their own resources through sales tax on goods.\nDespite the constitutional requirement to allocate 57.5pc of the NFC divisible pool to provinces, Dr Hafiz Pasha said they received only 45.8pc in the last fiscal year. Speaking at a Social Policy and Development Committee seminar on NFC recently, he explained that a nearly 12pc share was withheld either by charging petroleum levy on products that are not part of the divisible pool or by getting back transferred money in the shape of cash surpluses. The federal government collected over Rs1.2tr in petroleum levy, and the provinces also saved Rs921bn as cash surplus.\nAs highlighted in a 2023 World Bank report, the federal government retains ministries linked to devolved subjects and spent Rs328bn on them. A working group will make recommendations on sharing financial expenses incurred by the federation in areas under provincial jurisdiction.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 12th, 2026",

      "fullText": "\u2022 Report highlights trade-based money laundering in solar kit imports\u2022 Senate panel fumes over absence of economic minister, provincial secretaries\nISLAMABAD: Another episode of massive under-invoicing for tax evasion and trade-based money laundering through the import of solar kits came to light before a parliamentary committee, which expressed serious displeasure over the continued absence of the minister for economic affairs and provincial secretaries.\nThe Senate Secretariat released selected operational parts of a report presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), detailing grave irregularities in the import of solar home system kits under the Sindh Solar Energy Project (SSEP).\nThe report revealed that solar kits were declared at $16-$23.4 per unit for tax purposes by contractors, while payments of up to $112.44 per unit, or about 700 per cent higher, were made by the World Bank for the SSEP, reflecting a difference of $89-96 per unit. Investigations are underway into trade-based money laundering, tax evasion, fund layering and violations of foreign exchange rules.\nAccording to the report, M/s Beyond Green, Karachi, imported 10 consignments comprising 200,968 solar home system units between December 2024 and July 2025 through clearing agent M/s Vista Impex. The goods were declared under HS Codes 8501.7210 and 8501.711, attracting zero customs duty, 18pc sales tax, 3pc additional sales tax and zero income tax. Declared unit values ranged from $16.1 to $23.4, and four consignments were cleared through the Green Channel.\nSubsequent verification revealed that the goods declarations (GDs) submitted to the Sindh government were either fake or tampered with, a fact officially conveyed on Oct 9, 2025. Further investigation showed that the same kits were supplied to the Sindh government at manifold higher prices.\nOfficial contracts under the SSEP with M/s Shenzhen LEMI Technology Development Co Ltd, China, revealed a contractual price of approximately $112.44 per kit, excluding duties and taxes. The World Bank reportedly paid this amount directly to the supplier, the FBR report said.\nFor tax purposes, the transactional value was worked out at $103.08 per unit, leading to the forwarding of 10 contraventions to customs adjudication authorities. Show-cause notices have been issued and the matter is pending adjudication.\nThe Senate committee was inf\u00ador\u00admed that fake invoices amounting to $12.5 million were also generat\u00ad\u00aded. In addition, evidence suggested third-party remittances routed through UAE-based entities, raising alarms of trade-based money laundering, foreign exchange violations and fund layering. The case has been referred for proceedings under the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010, while a comprehensive sales tax audit has been recommended.\nThe committee was told that the SSEP implementation period ended on July 31, 2025, but around 30,000 solar kits out of 200,000 could not be distributed within the planned period and would now be handled under a separate arrangement.\nFollowing the identification of discrepancies, the Sindh cabinet had on Dec 1, 2025 referred the matter to the Enquiries and Anti-Corruption Establishment (EACE). A forensic audit has also been approved and is underway, while the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has taken cognisance of the case and is actively investigating.\nOn these revelations, committee chairman Saifullah Abro asked whether any suspensions of suspected officials had taken place and was informed that no suspensions had occurred so far. He directed that a letter be written to the chief minister to ensure that all individuals involved were held accountable.\nMinister\u2019s absence\nEarlier, the Senate panel expressed sharp criticism over the continued absence of Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema and senior bureaucrats, as well as the participation of junior officers from provincial governments, terming it a serious disregard for parliamentary oversight.\nAn additional secretary from the Economic Affairs Division informed the committee that the minister was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos. The explanation failed to satisfy the senators, with PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi remarking that he did not recall the minister ever attending a committee meeting and demanding that the minister\u2019s chair be removed.\nChairman Saifullah Abro reminded the meeting that parliamentary rules were explicit, stating that the membership of a committee member or the minister could be cancelled in case of absence on three occasions without prior notice.\n\u201cIf the minister wants to increase corruption, then he should definitely not be in the committee, but if he wants to stop corruption, then he should come to the committee,\u201d he said, directing that a message be conveyed to the minister that he had not been attending the panel for two years.\n\u201cWe are not removing the minister\u2019s chair, but tell him that this behaviour is not good,\u201d Senator Abro said.\nDuring the meeting, agenda items related to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa projects were postponed and provincial officers were asked to leave after it emerged that officials below grade-20 had been deputed to represent the province.\nThe committee decided that a formal letter be written to the KP chief secretary to ensure that provincial secretaries attend the next meeting, failing which the matter would be referred to the Privileges Committee.\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

Data worth Rs70-80bn is [available] on the dark web,\u201d the senator said.\nThe dark web refers to websites that are not indexed by search engi\u00adnes, and are usually encry\u00adpted, only accessible through specialised browsers. This heightened anonymity makes it a hotbed for illegal activities, such as drug and/or arms sales, fraud and data theft etc.\nSenator Afnanullah pointed out that when the data of any individual was stolen, it could be used for any purpose, including obtaining passports and identity cards for others.\n\u201cWhy is Pakistanis\u2019 data stolen time and again?\u201d he asked.\nAddressing Mustafa Jamal Kazi of the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports, he added: \u201cLet me tell you one thing; without the [involvement of] people inside the organisation, data theft at such a large scale is not possible. It is impossible. The data of 240 million people cannot be stolen just like that.\u201d\nLater, speaking to Dawn, the PML-N senator asserted that this data could not have been leaked without the involvement of officials in the Nadra and Immig\u00adration and Passports Directorate General.\nIn the meeting, Committee Cha\u00adi\u00adr\u00adperson and PTI Senator Faisal Saleem Rahman had asked Mr Kazi whether any investigation had been carried out in this regard.\nMr Kazi responded that a probe had been conducted and officials had also been removed.\nSenator Rahman also stressed the need for ensuring the protection of law enforcement bodies\u2019data. \u201cWho will be responsible if their data is leaked?\u201d he said.\nProposal to ban social media platforms\nMinister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry also attended the meeting, and raised the issue of the use of social media by terrorists.\n\u201cPreviously, terrorists used guns. Now, they are using social media,\u201d he said, adding that social media companies would not even share the internet protocol addresses of users operating accounts being used for terrorism.\nSpeaking on the matter, Senator Rahman suggested that the government should enter into a contract with social media platforms. He further advised that platforms that did not cooperate with the government should be banned.\nPPP Senator Palwasha Khan endorsed these views, saying: \u201cA ban should definitely be imposed.\u201d\nSenator Rahman further pointed out that China had its own social media platforms and said, \u201cThere is no need to employ the services of those [companies] that are not cooperating.\u201d\nChaudhry responded to the suggestion, saying: \u201cThis is a big decision, you can take it. If we take it, it will be called an attack on the freedom of expression.\u201d\nPublished in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

For Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus, the assessed rates have largely been left unchanged or fixed for the first time.\nThe revised rates were notified through Valuation Ruling No. 2035 of 2026, which will come into effect from Jan 16, 2026.\nCustoms officials said the revision reflects a decline in international prices of older smartphones, particularly iPhones, as these devices approach the end of their commercial life cycle.\nThe downward adjustment, they added, is intended to align valuations with market rates and ensure the benefit is passed on to end consumers through lower duties and, potentially, lower retail prices.\nOfficials said the new ruling covers 62 mobile phone models across four leading brands, either through revised values or first-time valuation. They said the methodology relied on market inquiries, benchmarked against trade-in prices published on the official websites of manufacturers, including Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nThe government levies multiple charges on mobile phones, including a flat Rs250 per set, 18 per cent sales tax, withholding tax, a handset levy and regulatory duties. These are calculated on the notified assessed value of each handset.\nA comparison of values notified for 2026 with those issued in 2024 shows a sharp reduction in assessed values for used phones. Used iPhones recorded the steepest cuts, with declines ranging from 32pc to 81pc.\nAmong the biggest revisions, the assessed value of the iPhone 12 Pro fell to $155 from $280, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max was reduced to $215 from $340.\nThe iPhone 13 was cut to $170 from $280, the iPhone 11 Pro Max to $145 from $245, and the iPhone XS Max to $95 from $150. The iPhone X was lowered to $57 from $75.\nEven newer flagship models were revised downwards, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max reduced to $295 from $430, and the iPhone 13 Pro to $225 from $360.\nThe department also fixed assessment values for seven newer used iPhone models. Under the new rates, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been valued at $460, the iPhone 15 Pro at $390, the iPhone 15 Plus at $320, and the iPhone 15 at $310.\nFor the iPhone 14 lineup, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has been assessed at $360, the iPhone 14 Pro at $290, and the iPhone 14 at $210.\nSamsung, Google, OnePlus\nBy contrast, valuations for other major brands were largely unchanged. Only a marginal adjustment was recorded for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which was assessed at $255, reflecting a modest decline.\nOther Samsung models were valued at lower but steady levels, with the Galaxy S23 Plus assessed at $160, the Galaxy S23 at $140, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G at $160. Older models included the Galaxy S21 Plus 5G at $69, the Galaxy S21 5G at $50, the Galaxy S20 Plus at $46, and the Galaxy S20 at $41.\nFor Google Pixel devices, the ruling fixed values across newer and older models, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL at $260, the Pixel 9 Pro at $195, and the Pixel 9 at $150. The Pixel 8 Pro was valued at $188 and the Pixel 8 at $98.\nA similar pattern was reported for OnePlus phones, with the OnePlus 12 assessed at $184 and the OnePlus 12R at $105, while older models were valued at $92 for the OnePlus 11, $65 for the OnePlus 10 Pro, and $60 for the OnePlus 10T.\nAccording to the ruling, the notified values will apply to used mobile phones imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, and will form the basis for the assessment of duties and taxes at the time of import. The values will apply regardless of the specific grade or condition of the phones.\nIt further stipulates that devices must have been activated at least six months prior to export to Pakistan. Importers will be required to declare the activation period, which will be verified by assessing officers during clearance.\nCustoms officials said the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held consultations with stakeholders on Aug 12, Sept 26 and Dec 15 last year. Import data covering a 90-day period was collected and analysed, while market inquiries were carried out to determine revised values.\nFor brands and models imported commercially but not listed in the ruling, importers have been advised to determine assessable values under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "fullText": "The exchange rate is a critical economic variable for Pakistan. A competitive and credible currency regime should form the core of the nation\u2019s economic strategy, particularly given the country\u2019s dependence on foreign exchange for growth.\nUnfortunately, Pakistan has repeatedly used the exchange rate as a short-term stabilisation tool, often holding it at levels that favour political convenience rather than economic fundamentals. Once reserves are depleted, this approach has led to abrupt and disruptive corrections consistently undermining rather than enhancing export potential.\nThat said, it is incredibly important to have a competitive exchange rate as it improves export margins, encourages investment in tradable goods, and signals the viability of producing for global markets.\nHistory shows that prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports\nHowever, rate alone is insufficient; credibility is equally essential. Exporters are willing to invest and scale up operations only if they trust that relative prices will remain broadly aligned with fundamentals over time. In Pakistan\u2019s case, this trust has been repeatedly eroded.\nThe Musharraf era\nDuring the Musharraf administration, the rupee was kept stable at around Rs60 to the dollar throughout much of the 2000s. While this stability created an illusion of macroeconomic soundness, it concealed growing external imbalances.\nWhen the pressures finally surfaced, the adjustment was late and severe: from 2007 to 2009, the rupee dropped from roughly Rs60 to over Rs80 per dollar as reserves collapsed and an International Monetary Fund intervention became necessary. Exporters, who had operated under an overvalued currency, did not suddenly become competitive. Instead, they faced higher input costs, disrupted financing, and weakened financial positions.\nStability over fundamentals\nThe above pattern recurred between 2013 and 2017, with the rupee held between Rs100\u2013105 per dollar despite widening current-account deficits and falling reserves. Exporters consistently warned about the currency\u2019s overvaluation, but policy makers focused on maintaining price stability and political optics. When the inevitable adjustment occurred, it was abrupt and disorderly: the rupee\u2019s value dropped sharply in mid-2017, followed by a larger correction after 2018, reaching around Rs160 per dollar by mid-2019. This sudden realignment destabilised firms and inflation expectations instead of supporting a smooth transition.\nMarket distortions and eroding confidence\nThe last three years have proven even more damaging. Administrative controls, delayed adjustments, and the emergence of multiple exchange rates pushed pressure into informal markets.\nIn early 2023, the rupee experienced one of its steepest single-day falls, losing nearly 10 per cent within hours. Over the year, it depreciated by close to 30pc percent, at one point briefly approaching Rs300 per dollar before settling near Rs285 when administrative controls were introduced.\nThese shifts coincided with harsh stabilisation measures such as import compression, punitive interest rates, higher energy prices, and increased taxes. Any potential export gains from depreciation were negated by rising costs and collapsing confidence.\nRepeatedly underminig exports\nThese episodes highlight a clear lesson: prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax onexportsand a subsidy to imports. This encourages consumption and rent-seeking while discouraging investment in tradable sectors. When adjustment is finally forced, it comes as a crisis \u2014 too sudden and volatile to generate the intended export response. Exporters cannot recover lost markets overnight, nor can they invest amidst uncertainty and tightening financial conditions.\nGradual adjustment and integrated policy\nSuccessful export economies do not rely on dramatic devaluations. Instead, they allow gradual, market-aligned adjustments, avoid prolonged misalignments, and resist using the exchange rate as a political tool. Effective currency policy is complemented by competitive energy pricing, predictable taxation, efficient logistics, and skills development, enabling exporters to respond to price signals.\nFor example, Vietnam has pursued gradual adjustments that avoid prolonged overvaluation and limit volatility, giving exporters the confidence to invest and integrate into global value chains. Bangladesh has similarly adopted a steady crawl rather than crisis-driven devaluations, preserving export competitiveness and market share \u2014 a model Pakistan has repeatedly failed to emulate.\nConclusion: toward a credible exchange rate policy\nPakistan\u2019s core issue is not deciding between a \u2018strong\u2019 or \u2018weak\u2019 rupee. Rather, it is the persistent belief that administrative controls can substitute for competitiveness. Until the exchange-rate policy reflects fundamentals on a sustained basis and is part of a broader, credible export strategy, depreciation will remain disruptive, and exports will continue to be vulnerable to future crises.\nThe writer, a former CEO of Unilever Pakistan and of the Pakistan Business Council, serves on the boards of several public companies.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 19th, 2026",

      "fullText": "A CONTROVERSY is raging on both mainstream and social media over PIA\u2019s recentprivatisation. Unless this debate is addressed rationally, future privatisation transactions may also be at risk. Past experience offers a cautionary lesson: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to annul the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills did not revive the enterprise; instead, it led to itsclosurein 2015 and significantly slowed the overall privatisation process.\nThe popular binary often advanced \u2014 either retain enterprises under government ownership or privatise them \u2014 is flawed. Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations rather than ideological preferences. Pakistan has 85 commercial SOEs for diverse purposes across power, oil and gas; transport and communications; manufacturing, mining and engineering; finance; industrial estate development and management; and wholesale and retail trade. Of these, 51 are currently profitable. The argument that profitable SOEs should never be divested is as untenable as the view that all 34 lossmaking entities must be privatised. Neither ownership per se nor current financial performance should solely determine policy.\nThe basic principle for deciding whether an economic activity should be undertaken by the government \u2014 through its departments or through an SOE \u2014 rests on two questions: a) does the activity fall within the government\u2019s public policy framework? b) Can it be adequately performed by the private sector?\nRelevance to public policy framework:The PPF reflects the government\u2019s development priorities, as articulated in documents such as the Principles of Policy (Article 3 of the Constitution) and sectoral policies relating to agriculture, industry, trade, etc. In assessing alignment with the PPF, it is necessary to consider whether an SOE is connected to one or more core state functions \u2014 i) ensuring national food security; ii) developing and managing large-scale infrastructure; iii) national defence and security-related activities; iv) entities established through government-to-government or intergovernmental arrangements; and v) provision of goods and services of critical national economic interest. If an SOE falls into any of these categories, there is a prima facie case for retaining it under government control. The decision then is whether it should be retained in its existing form or restructured to improve performance.\nDecisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations.\nMarket failure considerations:The second question concerns market failure: can the private sector adequately deliver the relevant activity? Each SOE must be evaluated in terms of its operations, functions and market structure, with attention to the following: a) is the SOE a natural monopoly; if so, does an effective regulatory framework exist to ensure socially optimal and cost-effective service delivery under private ownership? b) Does the SOE perform a function that generates significant positive externalities and is, therefore, insufficiently profitable for the private sector to undertake? c) Are there alternative delivery mechanisms to achieve the same objectives?\nWhere market failure prevents the private sector from maximising social welfare, the government has a strong case for retaining control. Even then, competition can be introduced by dismantling monopolies where feasible and establishing strong, independent regulatory agencies.\nFinancial viability:While several SOEs report accounting profits, financial viability requires more rigorous assessment. The key question is whether the organisation can generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, meet debt obligations, and, where relevant, finance investment for growth while maintaining acceptable service standards. The financial viability test should be based on the following: a) Negative shareholders\u2019 equity: Any entity with negative equity for the past three years is financially stressed, as its balance sheet is not bankable and it remains dependent on government guarantees or direct budgetary support. b) Continuous losses: Entities incurring losses over the last three years are similarly stressed, as losses either necessitate government support or gradually erode equity. c) Return on assets: While return on equity is a standard metric, ROA is more appropriate when equity is negative. ROA measures how effectively management uses assets to generate earnings. SOEs with an ROA below five per cent for three consecutive years should be considered financially stressed.\nIn such cases, financial restructuring is the first step. If restructuring fails under government ownership due to extraneous constraints, alternative options \u2014 such as outsourcing, leasing, concession agreements, or transfer of managerial control \u2014 should be considered. SOEs that don\u2019t meet public policy criteria, don\u2019t address market failure concerns, or cannot be made viable even after restructuring are prime candidates for privatisation, liquidation, or winding up.\nLessons from successful privatisation:Pakistan\u2019s main privatisation success stories are the banking and telecom sectors. In banking, the share of assets held by nationalised commercial banks declined from around 80pc to about 20pc following privatisation. Prior to 2003, the government injected Rs46 billion to recapitalise lossmaking banks; non-performing loans stood at 25pc, and financial soundness indicators were weak. Since privatisation, four major banks (HBL, UBL, MCB, and ABL) have contributed Rs245bn in corporate taxes in 2024 with cumulative contributions exceeding Rs1.6 trillion since 2004. NPLs have fallen below 7pc, provisioning exceeds 100pc, and overall financial soundness has improved.\nThe main weakness in recent years is the growing role of banks as public sector financiers, reflected in a declining advance-to-deposit ratio. Importantly, public sector banks such as the NBP and the Bank of Punjab have also improved under a competitive market structure and rank among the top 15 Asia-Pacific banks. The ideological argument that these institutions must also be privatised ignores the empirical evidence that ownership itself is not the decisive factor.\nPIA\u2019s case:Applying this framework (spelt out in the SOE Triage Report 2021) to PIA leads to a clear conclusion: there were no compelling public policy or market failure reasons for retaining it under government control. The aviation industry is competitive, and private operators have proved their capacity to perform effectively. Despite repeated restructuring efforts, PIA accumulated losses of Rs850bn. The privatisation objective was not short-term maximisation of sale proceeds but elimination of recurring losses and revival of the airline as an efficient enterprise. Over the longer term, improved performance under private management is expected to generate a steady stream of tax revenues rather than drain the exchequer. In sum, Pakistan needs an eclectic, evidence-based approach to SOEs, which transcends ideological divides and focuses squarely on public policy relevance, market structure, and financial viability.\nThe writer is a former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan.\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

Social capital soon becomes political capital, with the wealthy getting access to the political class, who make laws. If democracy is to endure, it must tame capitalism, not merely coexist with it.",
      "fullText": "\u201cTHE top 10% own three-quarters of global wealth, while the bottom half holds only 2%.\u201d So states the World Inequality Report 2026. Can democracy survive when capitalism concentrates wealth so drastically?\nThe belief that democracy and capitalism are natural allies is as widespread as it is inaccurate. To see this, one has only to observe capitalist accumulation under authoritarian political arrangements. The UAE is just one such example. Why then does this belief persist?\nDemocracy and capitalism often journey together \u2014 until they don\u2019t. To a point, they do support each other. This is why it is not easy to find democracies without capitalism. Think of a society, poor and authoritarian, that then undergoes a revolutionary change that makes it both democratic and capitalist. For a while, the two wo\u00ad\u00aduld go together. Democracy would bring freedom and political equality; capitalism would bring resources.\nEven Marx acknowledged that capitalism creates \u2018colossal productive forces\u2019. The growing middle class would demand greater freedoms and consumption, thereby strengthening both democracy and capitalism. For some time, prosperity and empowerment would rise together.\nBut this harmonious co-existence would soon wear off. Democracy is about political equality. Capitalism, by design, needs economic inequality. The two would eventually collide. In time, the wealth generated by capitalism starts to pool in fewer and fewer pockets. Growth continues, distribution falters. Tensions begin to appear.\nDemocracy is about political equality. Capitalism, by design, needs economic inequality.\nThis concentration is not just financial. Being rich doesn\u2019t just mean plush houses or private jets. It means connections and information, as the wealthy form exclusive social ties, venture together, share insights and tastes, thus increasing their collective purse. French sociologist Bourdieu has called this social capital, \u201caggregate of actual or potential resources\u201d that bring tangible benefits. High-profile events such as the Ambani wedding illustrate how this transformation happens. But the process does not stop here.\nSocial capital soon becomes political capital, with the wealthy getting access to the political class, who make laws. The role of the corporate lobby and campaign funding is well documented. These are some of the ways in which wealth buys political influence. Elon Musk\u2019s access to and authority in the White House was an example of the political power wealth can bring. Consequently, economic values of capitalism start to prevail over the political ideals of democracy, human rights and political equality, as the market dictates the state.\nWe have drifted far away from the attractive capitalist rhetoric of riches through hard work and entrepreneurship. Now, wealth generates wealth, creating inequalities not justifiable through merit. That inequality is endemic to capitalism and not just an irritating bug, is well shown by Thomas Piketty, who demonstrated that the return on capital (rent) grows faster than the return on labour (income). Proponents of capitalism may insist that inequality brings growth but such justifications ring hollow when wealth buys disproportionate political influence.\nOne would expect that, in a democracy, as people realise the asymmetry of wealth distribution they feel relatively poorer, and experience alienation in economic and political spheres, they would vote against such a system, demand reforms, regulatory constraints and a redirection. In theory, democracy should prevent capitalism from reaching its logical outcome of concentrating wealth among a small elite. Yet that concentration of wealth is exactly what has been happening. Why?\nWhen people suffer, they seek an explanation. Here, the narratives people have to make sense of their condition become important. There is a leftist narrative, including democratic socialism, which explains the alienation through a critique of capitalism, giving an economic explanation. But there is very little space for such narratives in school curricula or on the mainstream media. Instead, two other narratives prevail as they are pushed through by the mostly corporate-owned media. It is not an accident that some of the most powerful media outlets today \u2014 both conventional and social \u2014 are owned by billionaires or corporations.\nThe liberal media supports capitalism, insisting on its necessity for democracy. It projects billionaires as self-made, implying anyone can succeed. In the process, the role of inheritance, connections, tax evasion, low wages and corporate welfare is pushed under the carpet. The poor are blamed for their condition, as if it has nothing to do with systemic biases, inequitable access to education and capital or with historical injustices. This narrative claims capitalism as a bastion of innovation but sidelines the fact that only those advancements that bring profit are allowed, not those that genuinely improve human life. This glamorised but distorted storyline leaves people stuck between conviction (that they can make it) and anxiety (that they cannot).\nThe right-wing \u2014 and increasingly even sections of liberal \u2014 media weaponise panic and resentment against migrants, selected racial and religious groups, and unconventional identities by whispering that these \u2018unwashed\u2019 have stolen the wealth of the suffering workers. In time, these narratives cleverly divert the anger and distress resulting from capitalistic alienation towards oneself, fuelling an epidemic of mental illness, or towards creating scapegoats \u2014 while sparing capitalism and its contradictions. Unsurprisingly, a recent survey in the US showed that only 52pc of the least financially secure thought democracy was the best form of government; those who need it the most trust it the least. This misdirected rage is visible in many countries today, particularly in the US, UK and India.\nTo conclude, democracy and capitalism may begin as partners but soon the relationship turns antagonistic. Capital, with its material resources, seeks to break any restraints on it. Those who want both democracy and capitalism must build bulwarks \u2014 a social contract that curbs wealth concentration and ensures public ownership of sectors, education and health in particular \u2014 crucial for equality of opportunities. A critical political education of citizens, young and old, is also needed so that they do not fall for destructive narratives and are not diverted from the real causes of malaise. If democracy is to endure, it must tame capitalism, not merely coexist with it.\nThe writer is dean, Institute for Educational Development, Aga Khan University.\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has intensified its enforcement drive across the country against tax evasion in the private healthcare sector by placing Inland Revenue Service (IRS) officers directly at the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, senior tax officials toldDawnon Thursday.\nThe move marks a shift toward on-site monitoring as authorities seek to curb underreporting of taxable income in one of the country\u2019s most lucrative professional sectors. The initiative gained mom\u00adentum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.\nOfficial figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan\u2019s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns for TY2025.\nOf the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns for TY2025, only 43.20pc of those exist on tax rolls with the tax authorities, placing the profession among the least compliant sectors in the tax system.\nMoreover, even among those who filed tax returns, income declarations point to widespread underreporting, raising questions about enforcement, transparency, and the credibility of declared earnings within one of the country\u2019s most established and high earning professions.\nOfficers deputed at private hospitals to monitor revenue and ensure tax compliance\nA senior tax official toldDawnthat the FBR has begun deploying IRS officers directly at the premises of commercial entities, including private hospitals and clinics, to strengthen monitoring and enforcement. According to the official, these officers are tasked with observing the provision of medical services and the collection of receipts in real time.\nIn the first phase, officers have been posted at 50 commercial hospitals under Section175-C of the Income Tax Ordinance. The objective is to identify underreporting of revenues, particularly from high inpatient occupancy charges that, in some cases, exceed the rates charged by five star hotels.\n\u201cWe will identify non-compliant doctors through this exercise,\u201d the official said, adding that private notices are being issued to encourage voluntary compliance. The official noted that voluntary compliance from doctors has already begun following the issuance of these notices.\nThe data place the number of registered doctors on the tax rolls at 130,243, of whom 56,287 filed income tax returns in TY2025, about 43pc of those registered. Among the filers, 48,704 doctors declared income, representing roughly 87pc of those who submitted returns.\nOfficial figures showed that only around two in five registered doctors filed income tax returns in TY2025, with an even smaller share reporting taxable income.\nHowever, 7,583 doctors reported zero income in their tax returns for TY2025.\nFurther analysis of the returns showed that 30,000 doctors of the 48,704 doctors have declared less than Rs2 million annual income, which accounted for 61.59pc of all doctors who declared taxable income in their returns. This percentage goes to 65 percent of total return filers, who declared less than Rs2 million annual income.\nMoreover, most doctors fall in the lower reported income brackets.\nWithin the below Rs2m income bracket, the breakdown of tax returns declarations further highlights the scale of low declared earnings.\nAs many as 341 doctors reported annual income between Re1 and Rs100,000 in their returns, 17,647 doctors declared income ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1m, while 12,959 reported annual earnings between Rs1m and Rs2m for TY2025.\nAccording to data, a sharp decline in the number of doctors as income levels rise. The data show 6,655 doctors fall within the Rs2m to Rs3m annual income bracket, 6,959 doctors are in the Rs3m to Rs5m range, and 3,093 doctors declared annual income between Rs5m and Rs10m.\nAt the highest end of the scale, only 1,050 doctors declared annual income exceeding Rs10m in TY2025.According to the FBR, statistics highlight two gaps, first between registered doctors and those filing their tax returns, and second between filers and the income levels declared with the largest concentration of declarations below Rs2m per year in TY2025.\nPublished in Dawn, December 26th, 2025",

      "fullText": "The Directorate General of Customs Valuation has revised the determination of customs values for old and used mobile phones, particularly those imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, as per a ruling dated January 16.\nThe ruling,Valuation Ruling No. 2035/2026, specifies customs values for 62 models of old and used mobile phones without packaging and accessories in commercial quantities. Brands of these phones include Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, and OnePlus devices. These new values will be used to assess the duty and tax when the models are imported in commercial quantities.\nThe customs values will apply irrespective of any specific grade of the used mobile phones, according to the ruling. It also requires that the phones must have been activated at least six months before being exported to Pakistan. Importers are required to declare this activation period, which will then be verified by assessing officers.\nThis ruling has been issued under Section 25A of the Customs Act, 1969, and supersedes the Valuation Ruling No. 1893/2024 from June 27, 2024. This ruling will remain applicable unless rescinded or revised in terms of Section 25A(4) of the same Act.\nAccording to the issued ruling, the existing valuation was more than a year old and was no longer reflective of international market conditions.\nIn determining the new customs values, the methods provided under Section 25 of the Customs Act were applied in sequential order. The transaction value method under Section 25(1) was found inapplicable as the declared values did not correspond to market prices. The identical goods method under Section 25(5) and the similar goods method under Section 25(6) were also tried, but it was ascertained that they were not reliable metrics due to incomplete information and consistent variations in declared values.\nTherefore, the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held meetings with relevant stakeholders on August 12, September 26, and December 15 of the last calendar year to come to this re-determination. During the process, 90 days of import data were retrieved and scrutinised, and marked inquiries were conducted in accordance with Office Order No. 17/2014 under Section 25(7) of the Customs Act, 1969, after adjusting product amounts to arrive at C&F values.\nFor brands and models of mobile phones imported in commercial quantities, but not listed under the ruling, those concerned have been advised to assess the goods under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.\nThe ruling notes that where declared values or invoiced values are higher than the customs values, the ruling will be made on the higher value in terms of Section 25(1) of the Act. In the case of consignments imported by air, the difference between air and sea freight will be added for the valuation.\nCustoms authorities have been directed to ensure the implementation of the valuation ruling and to report any anomalies to the Directorate General.",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu\u00adtio\u00adnal Court (FCC) on Tuesday ruled that a federal law imposing excise duty and a provincial law aimed at advancing labour welfare, though overlapping in scope, do not conflict with each other and instead operate within their respective spheres of legislative competence, rendering both constitutionally valid.\n\u201cBoth enactments stand on firm constitutional footing, not in conflict but in constitutional harmony, each valid in its own aspect,\u201d observed Justice Aamer Farooq, who headed a two-judge FCC bench that dismissed a challenge filed by Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd against amendments introduced by the Balochistan government to a federal excise law.\nIn its 15-page verdict, the court explained that while the imposition of excise duty squarely falls within federal legislative competence, the advancement of labour welfare, when viewed from the perspective of public interest, lies well within the provincial domain.\nThe controversy at hand revolved around a petition instituted by Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd, an entity engaged in the production and sale of cement, with its manufacturing facility located at Hub, Lasbela, Balochistan. The petition challenged a Nov 27, 2023 order of the Balochistan High Court.\nAttock Cement\u2019s challenge to BHC verdict dismissed\nThe petition was initially filed before the Supreme Court but was later transferred to the newly established FCC following the enactment of the 27th Amendment.\nOn Jan 15, 2021, the factory was served with a notice by the Mines Labour Welfare Department, Balochistan, requiring payment of excise duty on minerals to the Labour Welfare Commissioner, Balochistan, at rates revised pursuant to the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020.\nIn response, the factory submitted three separate representations to the department, seeking revision of the applicable rates. However, all three representations were declined.\nDuring the hearing before the FCC, counsel for the factory, Khurram M. Hashmi and Noman A. Farooqi, argued that the provincial assembly, by amending Section 3 of the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour Welfare) Act, 1967 through Section 7 of the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020, had acted without legislative competence. They contended that the imposition of excise duty fell within the exclusive federal legislative domain and that the Balochistan Assembly therefore lacked the authority to amend the 1967 Act, particularly where such amendment effectively altered the rate or nature of excise duty.\nHowever, in the judgement, Justice Farooq observed that the objective of the Labour Welfare Act, 1967 was unmistakably oriented towards the advancement of labour welfare, a domain constitutionally entrusted to the provinces.\nThe mechanism through which this objective is pursued \u2014 the imposition of a duty of excise \u2014 is not an end in itself but a means carefully designed to finance a broader public interest. The statute, the judgment noted, does not merely levy a tax; rather, it establishes an administrative framework for the collection, allocation and utilisation of the proceeds, all of which are inextricably linked to the welfare of labour employed in the industry.\nThus, while the recovery of excise duty constitutes the operative mechanism of the Act, its spirit, essential character and constitutional essence lie in the realisation of labour welfare. The excise duty, the court held, is instrumental in achieving this predominant provincial objective, rendering the Act, in its true nature, an expression of social welfare legislation rather than mere taxation.\nEven if, by a strict reading of the preamble and operative provisions of the 1967 Act, its dominant character were to be construed as the collection and imposition of excise duty, its underlying purpose could not be ignored. Such a conclusion, the court said, merely reveals an overlap between two constitutional competences: the federal authority to levy excise duty and the provincial responsibility to advance labour welfare.\nThis incidental overlap, the judgment added, does not justify invalidating the statute. Justice Farooq emphasised that the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) of 2010 consciously embraced the ethos of cooperative federalism, wherein legislative fields are not rigid silos but, at times, interacting spheres.\nIn this constitutional landscape, incidental overlap does not render a statute ultra vires. The court further observed that following the 18th Amendment, the Concur\u00adrent Legislative List was abolished, significantly expanding provincial legislative authority, with matters not explicitly listed in the Federal Legislative List falling within the exclusive domain of the provinces.\nThe FCC also acknowledged the traditional use of the \u201cpith and substance\u201d doctrine in determining legislative competence, noting that courts have increasingly relied on the \u201cdouble aspect\u201d doctrine, which permits a single subject to be legislated upon by both federal and provincial governments from different perspectives.\nIn the end, the FCC denied leave to appeal and dismissed the petition filed by the cement manufacturer.\nPublished in Dawn, January 14th, 2026",

Authorities also waived fees for public kindergartens beginning last fall.\nAnd consumers must now pay a 13pc value-added tax for contraception, including condoms, after Beijing removed exemptions from January 1.\nDespite government efforts to reverse the trend, China ranked among the top 10 countries with the lowest birth rates in 2023, according to World Bank data, just after Japan.

      "fullText": "PRIME Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s reiteration that Pakistan\u2019s economic future is in \u201cexport-led growth\u201d risks remaining political rhetoric in the absence of credible reforms to improve productivity. Speaking in Davos, he noted that our exports are facing a myriad of challenges. But, he added, the way forward is clear: Pakistan has to have export-led growth. The diagnosis is undoubtedly correct. Pakistan\u2019s repeated balance-of-payment crises are rooted in its chronic inability to expand exports and its overdependence on foreign borrowing and remittances. Nonetheless, the statement is a reminder of the complete disconnect between political rhetoric on exports and the absence of a credible plan to achieve this repeatedly stated goal. Successive governments, including the incumbent one, have consistently talked up export-led growth and failed to follow it up with reforms needed to diversify the country\u2019s narrow, low-value exports and improve the competitiveness of the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.\nThe stagnation in exports and sluggish growth in recent years indicate that the economic policy reforms the PM spoke about have fallen well short of addressing the structural weaknesses, or what is required to raise productivity, attract long-term investment and diversify the export base. Indeed, the government has managed to restore a semblance of macroeconomic stability. But this has come at a steep cost to economic growth and export competitiveness. So far, little has been done to fix the inefficient energy sector or to restructure the inequitable tax system. Both continue to impose excessive costs on manufacturers and exporters, erode industrial competitiveness and deter investment in productive sectors. In sum, short-term stabilisation cannot substitute long-term competitiveness if the stated goal is to boost exports for sustained growth. No matter how often the PM and his finance team repeat their favourite refrain about their intentions of redirecting the economy towards export-led growth, it will remain more an empty slogan to placate an economically distressed population than a strategy unless accompanied by a credible productivity reform roadmap.\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "fullText": "\u2022 Leghari says electricity cuts due to fuel mismanagement, transmission constraints, among other causes\u2022 Minister contests \u2018outdated\u2019 Nepra report, says document should have been shared for \u2018fact-checking\u2019\u2022 Claims tariff dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 in December 2025\nISLAMABAD: The government on Sun\u00adday conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8\u201310 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.\nSpeaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and \u2018mistakes\u2019 in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.\nThis resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.\nThe minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.\nHe said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.\nMr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps \u2014 both low recoveries and high losses \u2014 were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers\u2019 money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.\nThe minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.\nHe said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.\nHe agreed with the Nepra\u2019s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under \u2018take or pay\u2019 or \u2018must run\u2019 agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.\n\u2018Without due diligence\u2019\nResponding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.\n\u201cWe have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan\u2019s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,\u201d he said.\nThe minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.\nHe also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. \u201cIn the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,\u201d he said.\nHe also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was \u2018a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos\u2019. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.\nHe said the Discos\u2019 recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.\nCircular debt\nContesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator\u2019s \u201cunderstanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising\u201d.\nHe said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.\nMost importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. \u201cK-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric\u2019s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.\nThe receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,\u201d the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.\nResponding to Nepra\u2019s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

Before this drop, prices had increased by 4.4pc during October and November.\nKarachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, reported distribution-stage system losses of 12.55pc, up from 10.6pc a couple of months earlier. Meanwhile, Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), supplying gas to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported system losses of nearly 9pc at the distribution stage, compared to 7.47pc in October.\nAccording to the notification, the RLNG sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage declined by 4.62pc to $10.41 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for January 2026, from $10.92 per mmBtu in December 2025 and $11.24 in September.\nAs a result, the sale price at the distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 4.68pc to $11.27 per mmBtu for January, compared to $11.83 in December and $12.24 in November.\nOn the other hand, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL at the transmission stage decreased by 5.25pc to $8.98 per mmBtu for January, from $9.47 in December, $10.065 in November and $9.86 in September.\nThe distribution-stage sale price for SSGCL was also reduced by 5.26pc to $10.21 per mmBtu for the current month, compared to $10.77 in December, $11.45 in November and $11.01 in September.\nOgra said the reduction in RLNG prices was due to a decrease in the delivered ex-ship (DES) price. Unaccounted-for gas (UFG) for both companies at the distribution stage had increased two months ago.\nIronically, the RLNG distribution prices of $10.21 per mmBtu for SSGCL and $11.27 for SNGPL are almost $3.3 and $4.25 per mmBtu higher than the average DES price, respectively.\nThis is mainly because both LNG importers, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL), along with port authorities, charge profit margins on account of retainage at the rate of 3.77pc of the DES price, on top of losses of 8.97pc for SNGPL and 12.55pc for SSGCL.\nPublished in Dawn, January 17th, 2026",

      "fullText": "NEPRA\u2019S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.\nIn fact, the power sector\u2019s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector\u2019s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector\u2019s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator\u2019s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "\u2022 Transmission system suffers from overloading, underutilisation\u2022 116 of 192 transformers overloaded beyond 80pc capacity\u2022 Regulator urges fast-tracking projects, upgrading substations\u2022 Says up to 1,750MW of cheaper power frequently curtailed\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019s nati\u00adonal transmission system, one of the largest in the world, suffers from a damaging mix of overloading and underutilisation, creating operational constraints that unde\u00adrmine merit-based power supply and impose an unquantifiable financial burden on consumers and the national economy, the National Electric Power Regul\u00adatory Authority (Nepra) has said.\nIn a detailed review of the national grid system, the regulator pointed out that the backbone of the transmission network \u2014 500kV and 220kV lines \u2014 remained \u201cmostly overloaded\u201d at the close of FY2024-25. It said the National Grid Company (NGC) faced critical overloading in several sections of its 500kV and 220kV network, particularly during summer peak demand.\n\u201cMany grid stations and power transformers are operating beyond 80 per cent of their rated capacity, risking equipment failure, voltage instability and outages,\u201d it said. In FY25, out of 192 transformers across 68 grid stations, 116 were overloaded beyond 80pc, it added.\nProviding a breakdown, Nepra said 30 of 47 transformers at the 500/220kV level were overloaded beyond 80pc. In addition, 86 of 145 transformers at the 220/132kV level were overloaded beyond the same threshold.\nRegions with notable overloading included Hyderabad, Islamabad, Lahore and Multan, with persistent constraints at key grids like Gatti, New Multan, Sarfaraz Nagar, Muzaffargarh and Sheikhupura.\n\u201cThese limitations have led to reliance on expensive generation in violation of economic merit order (EMO) and rising project costs due to delays,\u201d it said.\nIronically, most of these grid stations at Rawat, Sheikhupura, Gatti, Multan, Yousafwala, Jamshoro and Muzaffargarh have been in an overloaded condition since 2017-18 and onwards.\nAccording to the review, these constraints have limited full power evacuation from the 1,300MW Sahiwal coal-fired plant, overreliance on Attock, Halmore, Sapphire and Liberty, limited transformation capacity in the south-central corridor and aggravated bidirectional power flows in the network.\nThe regulator called for fast-tracking the completion of critical transmission projects, upgrading existing substations with higher-capacity transformers and reactive power support, and enhancing real-time grid monitoring to address persistent overloading in the transmission network.\nIt said the resulting financial burden could not be calculated under current conditions because assessing the severity and duration of overloading would require hourly digitised operational data to determine how long a transformer or circuit operated beyond its rated capacity.\nThe regulator warned that transmission system constraints significantly impact the overall efficiency, reliability and affordability of electricity supply. When the transmission network lacks adequate capacity or flexibility, it restricts the flow of power from generation sources to demand centres.\n\u201cThis leads to congestion, increased transmission losses and underutilisation of low-cost or renewable generation, ultimately raising the overall cost of electricity,\u201d Nepra said.\n\u201cTransmission constraints not only raise reliability concerns for consumers but also lead to higher electricity tariffs. This is primarily because, in the absence of adequate transmission capacity, the system must rely on more expensive and less efficient power generation sources, even when cheaper alternatives are available but inaccessible,\u201d it explained.\nIt said that one of the key challenges in the country\u2019s power sector was the persistent inadequacy of the transmission system, particularly in evacuating electricity from cost-effective and indigenous generation resources located in the southern part of the country.\nIt noted that the system was often forced to rely on more expensive power plants in the northern region, which significantly increased the overall cost of electricity supply.\nDespite the critical importance of resolving these issues, many transmission bottlenecks have remained unaddressed for years. The NGC has consistently failed to resolve them in a timely and efficient manner.\nObservations show that nearly every second project undertaken by the NGC suffers from time delays and cost overruns. These delays not only inflate capital costs but also result in operational inefficiencies, such as the forced dispatch of power plants in violation of the EMO, leading to substantial financial losses for the power system.\nThe south-to-north transmission corridor remains a major bottleneck in NGC\u2019s network, limiting the transfer of cost-effective electricity primarily from coal, nuclear and gas plants in the south to key demand centres in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nAs a result, the system continues to rely on more expensive residual fuel oil (RFO) and re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) generation in the north, pushing up generation costs and tariffs.\nThe regulator cited the example of the overloaded 500kV Jamshoro and Matiari grid stations and their associated lines, which it said restrict power flow to about 1,800MW against available system capacity of 4,500MW. This bottleneck causes frequent load curtailment of up to 1,750MW of cheaper power. Evacuation of more than 2,000MW from Karachi\u2019s two nuclear power plants was another example.\nAs a related event, the 4,000MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) Matiari-Lahoretransmission line, commissioned in September 2021 over 878km, still remains underutilised due to delays in completing the 500kV Lahore North substation and related transmission lines.\n\u201cThis inefficiency imposes a financial burden on end-users despite the line\u2019s full operational readiness,\u201d the regulator said, adding that average loading of the line in FY2024-25 was recorded as 1,401.40MW with utilisation factor at just 35.04pc. There are many other such examples of smaller scale, Nepra noted.\nThe regulator also highlighted weaknesses in grid monitoring infrastructure. It said the original Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, the telecom backbone operational since 1992, had become obsolete due to the lack of hardware and software upgrades, impairing functionality.\nPublished in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

      "fullText": "MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government has warned that failure to ensure responsible use of electricity could force a review of the region\u2019s existing highly subsidised power tariffs, which may then be determined strictly on demand-and-supply principles.\nIn a public message addressed to electricity consumers, AJK\u2019s secretary for energy resources Chaudhry Muhammad Tayyab said the government had, in response to public demand, substantially reduced electricity rates for both domestic and commercial users.\n\u201cThis extraordinary reduction in tariffs has resulted in an equally extraordinary increase in electricity consumption,\u201d he said, adding that the resulting pressure on the system had pushed the power distribution network to its limits.\nHe explained that electricity demand peaked during winter in Muzaffarabad and Poonch divisions and during summer in Mirpur division, mainly due to extensive use of electric heaters, geysers and, most notably, electric cooking stoves in winter, and the unchecked use of air-conditioners in summer.\nEnergy secretary says increased consumption pushing distribution network to its limits\n\u201cAs a result, the power distribution system comes under intense pressure, making transformer burnouts and breakdowns a routine occurrence, which ultimately causes hardship for consumers,\u201d Mr Tayyab said, describing the situation as highly unpleasant for the electricity department.\nHe said engineers and technicians were working round the clock, repairing damaged transformers and striving to keep the power supply running or to restore it at the earliest. Despite limited resources, he added, the AJK government was making every possible effort to stabilise the distribution network, with valuable assistance from the federal government.\nHowever, Mr Tayyab stressed that meaningful improvement in the prevailing situation was impossible without public cooperation, urging consumers to avoid unnecessary and excessive use of electricity, pay their bills on time, and clear all outstanding dues.\nHe specifically appealed to people to refrain from using electric stoves for cooking, exercise restraint in the use of air-conditioners, and limit the use of inverter ACs for heating during winter, particularly by switching them off before going to sleep. He also called on households to avoid installing unnecessary decorative outdoor lights and searchlights.\nHighlighting the issue of electricity theft, Mr Tayyab urged citizens to identify and report those involved, assuring that the identity of informants would be kept confidential. He said a dedicated helpline for reporting power theft would be announced soon, and advised consumers to immediately contact the nearest electricity department office in case of missing or faulty meters.\nThe continued \u201cirresponsible use of low-cost electricity\u201d, he warned, would further worsen the situation.\n\u201cIn such a situation, the government will be compelled to review the current highly subsidised tariffs and determine electricity prices strictly in accordance with demand and supply principles,\u201d he added.\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "fullText": "THE Europeans have had a dispiriting week. In the snowy landscape of Davos, leaders of the major European nations had to have a huddle about US President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating rhetoric on taking over Greenland. There were righteous speeches and statements by them about how such a takeover would be the end of the rules-based international order. Canada, which Trump had also threatened with a takeover, got into the game, too, with Prime Minister Mark Carney decrying the rupture in North Atlantic relations and the imminence of a world where force eliminates respect for sovereignty.\nIt was oddly gratifying to see the world\u2019s political and economic elite, mostly white men and some white women, having to consider how devastating attacks on sovereignty can be and how a superpower gone rogue is a global threat. The rest of the world saw this face of the US post 9/11, in the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, both under the label of \u2018protecting US national security\u2019. At that time, Europe joined forces with the US. So, why is Denmark suddenly so bothered with the details of sovereignty, especially given its part in the US-led Nato effort in Afghanistan? Nor did the US care when Barack Obama ordered unmanned aerial bombings of places in Pakistan. Definitions were altered to justify the US bombings in Yemen as well.\nAll this is to underscore that the international rules-based order that all the white men in Davos are weeping for died a long time ago. Or perhaps their tears simply affirm the truth that these rules were never considered applicable when the sovereignty of various brown and black people was at stake to ensure no one attacked the lands of the white colonisers.\nEurope has now discovered it has no recourse against Trump.\nThe irony of the moment where one colonising power (Denmark) insists that its rights over Greenland are more legitimate than the rights of another (the US, a settler colonial country) must be noted. Listening to Carney\u2019s much-lauded speech, for instance, it was impossible not to recall that Canada\u2019s white people stole land from the First Nations. The temerity of white men who rule stolen lands and then chastise the world about further theft of land represents the disordered ethics that have made white and Western cooperation against the rest of the world a \u2018legitimate\u2019 exercise.\nDenmark established trade relations in Greenland and its representatives set up outposts on the territory. The Danes realised they had made enough inroads to take over. They then imposed a trade monopoly on Greenland and what had been a trading company transformed itself into an administrative state.\nIn all the outcry, no one has acknowledged that Greenland\u2019s indigenous Kalaallit populations don\u2019t want to be ruled by either Denmark or the US. As Vijay Prashad of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research notes: \u201cGreenland is always a place that someone else must hold, but not the Kalaallit. For people like Trump, or indeed for generations of Danish prime ministers (despite soft statements about the path to self-determination), the Kalaallit have no role as political subjects.\u201d The true solution is not some backroom deal where the US can get what it wants while leaving Denmark with face-saving control, but a return of Greenland to its people.\nThe entire debacle underscores what the rules-based international order was really for. True to its origins, which go back to the time when the Great Powers carved up what remained of the Ottoman Empire, the rules-based international order ensures that white and Western nations, either colonisers or settler col\u00adonialists, do not mess with each other\u2019s illegitimate claims on ter\u00adritory. It also exi\u00adsts to legitimise the use of force impacting the sovereignty of brown and black countries when the aggressor is one of its own.\nFor most of the world, the international rules-based order has never provided safety. The brutish world where force means the power to bully is one which everyone, except white and Western countries, has experienced. Currently, Europe is in a bind. It had saved money by not spending on military and defence, which allowed Europeans to have easy lifestyles. Europe has now discovered it has no recourse against Trump.\nWhatever happens to Greenland, Europe, home to so many colonising powers that caused devastation and pain around the world, is getting its just deserts. Its weak economy and ageing populations are festering problems which America under Trump is likely to exploit. It\u2019s possible that Europe, while superficially independent, will be reduced to a functional colony of the US \u2014 dependent economically and militarily on the Americans. If it does, history will have come full circle: that which Europe did to others will now be done to Europe.\nThe writer is an attorney teaching constitutional law and political philosophy.\nrafia.zakaria@gmail.com\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2026",

      "fullText": "BERLIN: European far-right and populist parties that once cheered on Donald Trump and gained in standing through his praise are now distancing themselves from the US president over his military incursion into Venezuela and bid for Greenland.\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly backed far-right European parties that share a similar stance on issues from immigration to climate change, helping legitimise movements that have long faced stigma at home but are now on the rise.\nThe new US National Security Strategy issued last month said  \u201cthe growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism.\u201d  But those parties now face a dilemma as disapproval of Trump rises across the continent over his increasingly aggressive foreign policy moves and in particular his efforts to acquire Greenland from Denmark.\nAfD berates Trump\n\u201cDonald Trump has violated a fundamental campaign promise namely, not to interfere in other countries,\u201d Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany said, while party co-leader Tino Chrupalla rejected  \u201cWild West methods\u201d.\nThe AfD has been cultivating ties with Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 but polls suggest this may no longer be beneficial. A survey by pollster Forsa released on Tuesday showed 71pc of Germans see Trump more as an opponent than an ally.\nWariness of Trump has grown since he vowed on Saturday to slap tariffs on a raft of EU countries including Germany, France, Sweden and Britain, until the US is allowed to buy Greenland. Those countries had last week sent military personnel to the vast Arctic island at Denmark\u2019s request.\nNational Rally leader Jordan Bardella said Europe must react, referring to  \u201canti-coercion measures\u201d and the suspension of the economic agreement signed last year between the EU and the United States. British populist party Reform UK, whose leader Nigel Farage has long feted his close ties with Trump, said it was hard to tell if the president was bluffing. \u201cBut to use economic threats against the country that\u2019s been considered to be your closest ally for over a hundred years is not the kind of thing we would expect,\u201d Reform said in a statement published on Jan 19.\nBlunter still was Mattias Karlsson, often cited as chief ideologist of the far-right Sweden Democrats. \u201cTrump is increasingly resembling a reversed King Midas,\u201d he wrote on X.  \u201cEverything he touches turns to shit.\u201d  Political scientist Johannes Hillje said it would always be hard for nationalists to forge a common foreign policy  \u201cbecause the national interests do not always converge.\u201d\nKeeping out of the fray\nNot all European far-right and populist parties have been so critical. Some, like the far-right Dutch Party for Freedom and Spanish Vox, praised Trump for removing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro yet kept silent on his Greenland threats.\nOthers, such as Polish President Karol Nawrocki and the nationalist government of Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban have called for the issue of Greenland to be settled bilaterally between the United States and Denmark. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis posted a video on social networks on Tuesday in which he brandished a map and a globe to show how big Greenland was and how close it was to Russia if it were to send a missile.\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

The fingers of one of the hands were  \u201cretouched to become pointed like claws \u2014 a style of painting only seen in Sulawesi,\u201d the Canadian archaeologist added.\nTo determine the art\u2019s age, the team took five-millimetre samples from  \u201ccave popcorn\u201d, which are small clusters of calcite that form on the walls of limestone caves. Then they zapped the layers of rock with a laser to measure how the uranium decayed over time, compared to a more stable radioactive element called thorium.\nThis  \u201cvery precise\u201d technique gave the scientists a clear minimum age for the painting, Aubert explained.\nAt 67,800 years old, the Indonesian stencil is more than a thousand years older than other hand stencils found in a Spanish cave which has been attributed to Neanderthals.\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Despite over 35 years of \u2018reforms\u2019 and policy interventions, Pakistan\u2019s power sector remains incapable of instilling confidence in the country\u2019s economic growth and in consumers\u2019 trust, leading to gains secured from power producers through renegotiations evaporating amid unending inefficiencies.\nThis charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship \u2018State of the Industry Report 2025\u2019, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.\nIt said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.\nIt said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, \u201coverall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development\u201d.\nNepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt\nIt pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).\nOn the distribution side, many go\u00ad\u00advernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com\u00adme\u00adrcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie\u00adncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con\u00adtribute to the circular debt problem.\nIt said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. \u201cPersistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector\u2019s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth\u201d, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector\u2019s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.\nThe regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.\nIt appreciated the government\u2019s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. \u201cConsequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs\u2019 tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms\u201d.\nOn top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal.\nReduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.\nA notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.\nThe regulator put on record that \u201cKE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.\nIt said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.\nAs if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator\u2019s monitoring and enforcement drive had \u201cbeen diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions\u201d. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator\u2019s monitoring and enforcement efforts.\nPublished in Dawn, January 17th, 2026",

      "fullText": "\u2022 Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months\u2022 Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector\nISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).\nWhile testifying before the National Assembly\u2019s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr\u00ado\u00adleum Minister Ali Per\u00advaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.\nThe minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.\nInterestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared topetrol and dieselwhich are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.\nIn the last week of November 2025, Ogra haddeterminedup to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra\u2019s determination within 40 days.\nThe minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan hadconcludedsuccessful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac\u00adh\u00aded to manage excess supplies.\nMNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector\u2019s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.\nThe minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been \u201cquelled\u201d, which was a critical reform measure.\nSui gas companies\u2019 managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.\nThe Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.\nCommittee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.\nOfficials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.\nNo domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.\nThe committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.\nThe minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.\nThe committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2026",

These patterns are expected during the winter months.\nDecember\u2019s electricity generation mix was dominated by coal (24pc) and nuclear (25pc), followed by RLNG (17pc). Coal generation saw an increase of 125pc compared to the same month last year, while nuclear output posted modest growth of 3pc.\nThe data shows the government\u2019s shift away from furnace oil, traditionally the most expensive source of power generation.

      "fullText": "Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar\u2019s remarks at a business conference last week reflect growing political pressure on the government to redirect the sluggish economy, which has produced the decades-high levels of unemployment and poverty in the last two to three years, towards growth. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s government would now focus on increasing national output until the end of his tenure, arguing that jobs can only be generated through sustained economic expansion.\n\u201cAfter achieving stability, we will now move towards economic growth and will engage the International Monetary Fund [IMF] as well,\u201d he declared at the Pakistan Policy Dialogue organised by the Policy Research and Advisory Council (PRAC) in Islamabad.\nHis pronouncement came days after planning minister Ahsan Iqbal had expressed similar thoughts, saying a panel led by him had proposed to the prime minister after consultations with stakeholders to declare \u201cexport emergency\u201d to put the country back on the road to growth after a prolonged period of stabilisation under the IMF.\nThe planned export emergency will target to raise exports by 40 per cent over four years and by around 200pc in 10 years by removing administrative bottlenecks faced by exporters in order to end the country\u2019s dependence on the IMF bailouts.\nCritics of stabilisation highlight the increasingly visible socioeconomic costs of prolonged economic stagnation\nMr Dar said, given the country\u2019s annual population growth of 2.6pc, an economic expansion below this rate effectively amounts to negative growth, and that this view was shared with the prime minister in recent discussions over the state of the economy. His assertion that the IMF programmes are \u201cgenerally anti-growth\u201d reflects both political pressure from within and beyond the ruling PML-N, as well as the economic fatigue being felt by businesses and ordinary people.\nThe statements of the two key government ministers, especially Mr Dar, who holds sway over most economic policy matters, signify the urgency of the situation amid reports that certain powerful quarters are not happy with the economy\u2019s weak performance and are pushing for changes in the government\u2019s finance team and economic strategy to accelerate growth.\nVoicing these feelings, Younus Dagha, Chairman of PRAC, pointed out that high poverty levels, widespread unemployment, a punitive tax regime that increased the tax burden on the salaried class by 230pc, a freeze in investment and capital flight are outcomes of stabilisation policies.\n\u201cThe critique of stabilisation does highlight the increasingly visible socioeconomic costs of prolonged economic stagnation. There is little doubt that poverty and unemployment have worsened. Tight monetary policy, sharp fiscal contraction and aggressive revenue measures have compressed demand, stalled private investment and eroded household purchasing power. The question is: what choice did the nation have?\u201d discussed a professor of economics who requested anonymity.\n\u201cThe issue is not stabilisation but lack of growth reforms. Attributing capital flight and investment paralysis solely to stabilisation policies risks oversimplification. Investors are deterred not just by austerity but by persistent structural failures: policy unpredictability, an inequitable tax system, weak contract enforcement, an unreformed energy sector and so on. Stabilisation did not create these problems; it just exposed them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe deeper issue is that adjustment in Pakistan has been extractive rather than reformative. Taxes were raised without broadening the base, and development spending was cut without public-sector restructuring. Energy prices are raised without fixing the power and gas sector losses. The stabilisation period was supposed to provide policymakers with an opportunity to implement politically tough, credible reforms for moving the economy back towards sustainable growth. However, this window is now closing fast. Going forward, the government will face mounting political pressure for rapid economic growth as it approaches the end of its tenure.\u201d\nThat said, it seems that key government figures realise the impossibility of returning to growth without a strong external sector. Mr Dar also acknowledged at the conference that the external sector remains the economy\u2019s most binding constraint and that repairing it would take time.\nMr Iqbal says Pakistan could potentially achieve 6pc economic growth by 2035, but warns that it would trigger another balance-of-payments crisis within two years unless the economy\u2019s structural weaknesses were addressed and export revenues boosted quickly. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, too, argued that sustainable growth, rather than short-lived expansion, must now be the policy priority. Even Mr Dar clarified that the government had no immediate plan to push growth to 6pc, and that reaching such a level would realistically take two to three years. \u201cWe are systematically addressing long-standing inefficiencies,\u201d he said.\nYet, it is increasingly becoming clear that the current \u201cstability\u201d has its own innate contradictions and can hardly be sustained for long as it is achieved by stifling the economy, curbing development spending, restricting imports and accumulating expensive debt.\nThree years of stabilisation may have prevented immediate collapse, but it is increasingly undermining its own sustainability by suppressing investment, productivity and exports. A way has to be found to return to growth before this stability turns into another crisis.\nWith official and private foreign inflows drying up amid stagnating exports, the government policymakers appear clueless as to how to turn the tide. That makes their job of putting the economy on a growth trajectory even more formidable. Political rhetoric sans credible reforms can do only so much.\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 19th, 2026",

      "fullText": "LAHORE: The provincial government\u2019s flagship project \u2013 \u201cSuthra Punjab Programme\u201d \u2013 has entered its \u201ccorrection phase\u201d in a bid to resolve the issues identified last year.\nThe project, according to the government, is the largest cleanliness programme, collecting and disposing of nearly 50,000 tonnes of solid waste on a daily basis in all cities, towns, union councils and villages across Punjab.\n\u201cThe most important aspect of this mega programme is admitting the issues and gaps we have witnessed in the phase-1 that ended on December 31st, last year. So, 2026 is the year of correction. And we can say that Suthra Punjab programme has entered its correction phase from January 1,\u201d Suthra Punjab Authority\u2019s Director General Babar Sahib Din explains in a talk withDawn.\nThe Maryam Nawaz-led Punjab government hadlaunchedthe programme in December 2024 after taking over the charge to overcome the lack of a cleanliness mechanism in the districts, except the metropolitan, municipal or urban areas of a few major cities. All other district and tehsil headquarters had a very old system that had almost collapsed.\nIn villages, union councils and small towns, no cleanliness system ever existed, which meant it was only available to 20 to 30 million people residing in a few major cities, and a majority of the population (around 100m or so) had no such system. This all forced the government to launch the project across the province to collect and dispose of around 50,000 tonnes of solid waste daily, including 35,000 tonnes of garbage that was not being collected and disposed of at all, resulting in serious environmental and health issues.\nThe DG says the first problem the officers identified was that the number of monitoring officials to supervise cleanliness on major roads was low, which is now being increased in the total 200,000 sq km populated area of Punjab, having 80,000 provincial and district highways.\nSimilarly, it was also noted that the city areas should have a second shift of sanitary workers, which is being arranged now. Another problem that was identified was the low number of workers in union councils. Last year, each UC had six workers, but the number is being increased to 16 to ensure proper cleanliness. Likewise, the number of equipment will also be increased in UCs.\nPreviously, the waste management companies existed only in divisional headquarters, which are now being expanded to all district headquarters. \u201cIn various districts, the waste management agencies have been set up,\u201d he says.\nHe says that due to the unavailability of a legal framework, the government has no mechanism to engage local or international companies in its waste-to-energy plans \u2014 the first proposed for Lahore to generate 40 to 50MW electricity. In the correction phase, the legal framework is being prepared for the purpose.\nTo a question, he says the programme\u2019s total human resource strength has reached 150,000 workers and other staffers. Similarly, the number of equipment/machinery has also increased to 30,000 units engaged in collecting and disposing off 45,000 to 50,000 tonnes of solid waste daily.\nTo another question, the DG says the government\u2019s role will be limited to facilitating the parties interested in participating in the bidding for waste-to-energy projects and providing potential electricity buyers, such as Sundar Industrial Estate, Orange Line project, city\u2019s electric bus system, Knowledge Park, etc.\nSharing details about the role of the private sector, he said the private companies have invested Rs120 billion in the programme by procuring machinery and other resources. The government didn\u2019t spend even a penny on this, as the project is designed on a public-private partnership (PPP) model.\n\u201cPreviously, the government used to spend Rs45 billion annually for the cleanliness of a few major cities havingpopulations over 20 to 30 million. But now only Rs70 billion are being spent on the total population of 130m in terms of solid waste management by providing subsidy,\u201d he explained.\nTo another question, he said the entire system, right from human resource to machinery to waste collection and disposal is digitised and being monitored online. According to him, the private companies engaged in the project are developing 150 landfill sites in cities and towns that never existed before.\n\u201cWe are heading fast towards holding a Guinness World Records event in Lahore, and hopefully this programme will be entered in the Guinness Book of World Records,\u201d he maintained.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

      "summary": "Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations rather than ideological preferences. Pakistan has 85 commercial SOEs for diverse purposes across power, oil and gas. The question is whether the state can provide a service that is cost-effective.",
      "fullText": "A CONTROVERSY is raging on both mainstream and social media over PIA\u2019s recentprivatisation. Unless this debate is addressed rationally, future privatisation transactions may also be at risk. Past experience offers a cautionary lesson: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to annul the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills did not revive the enterprise; instead, it led to itsclosurein 2015 and significantly slowed the overall privatisation process.\nThe popular binary often advanced \u2014 either retain enterprises under government ownership or privatise them \u2014 is flawed. Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations rather than ideological preferences. Pakistan has 85 commercial SOEs for diverse purposes across power, oil and gas; transport and communications; manufacturing, mining and engineering; finance; industrial estate development and management; and wholesale and retail trade. Of these, 51 are currently profitable. The argument that profitable SOEs should never be divested is as untenable as the view that all 34 lossmaking entities must be privatised. Neither ownership per se nor current financial performance should solely determine policy.\nThe basic principle for deciding whether an economic activity should be undertaken by the government \u2014 through its departments or through an SOE \u2014 rests on two questions: a) does the activity fall within the government\u2019s public policy framework? b) Can it be adequately performed by the private sector?\nRelevance to public policy framework:The PPF reflects the government\u2019s development priorities, as articulated in documents such as the Principles of Policy (Article 3 of the Constitution) and sectoral policies relating to agriculture, industry, trade, etc. In assessing alignment with the PPF, it is necessary to consider whether an SOE is connected to one or more core state functions \u2014 i) ensuring national food security; ii) developing and managing large-scale infrastructure; iii) national defence and security-related activities; iv) entities established through government-to-government or intergovernmental arrangements; and v) provision of goods and services of critical national economic interest. If an SOE falls into any of these categories, there is a prima facie case for retaining it under government control. The decision then is whether it should be retained in its existing form or restructured to improve performance.\nDecisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations.\nMarket failure considerations:The second question concerns market failure: can the private sector adequately deliver the relevant activity? Each SOE must be evaluated in terms of its operations, functions and market structure, with attention to the following: a) is the SOE a natural monopoly; if so, does an effective regulatory framework exist to ensure socially optimal and cost-effective service delivery under private ownership? b) Does the SOE perform a function that generates significant positive externalities and is, therefore, insufficiently profitable for the private sector to undertake? c) Are there alternative delivery mechanisms to achieve the same objectives?\nWhere market failure prevents the private sector from maximising social welfare, the government has a strong case for retaining control. Even then, competition can be introduced by dismantling monopolies where feasible and establishing strong, independent regulatory agencies.\nFinancial viability:While several SOEs report accounting profits, financial viability requires more rigorous assessment. The key question is whether the organisation can generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, meet debt obligations, and, where relevant, finance investment for growth while maintaining acceptable service standards. The financial viability test should be based on the following: a) Negative shareholders\u2019 equity: Any entity with negative equity for the past three years is financially stressed, as its balance sheet is not bankable and it remains dependent on government guarantees or direct budgetary support. b) Continuous losses: Entities incurring losses over the last three years are similarly stressed, as losses either necessitate government support or gradually erode equity. c) Return on assets: While return on equity is a standard metric, ROA is more appropriate when equity is negative. ROA measures how effectively management uses assets to generate earnings. SOEs with an ROA below five per cent for three consecutive years should be considered financially stressed.\nIn such cases, financial restructuring is the first step. If restructuring fails under government ownership due to extraneous constraints, alternative options \u2014 such as outsourcing, leasing, concession agreements, or transfer of managerial control \u2014 should be considered. SOEs that don\u2019t meet public policy criteria, don\u2019t address market failure concerns, or cannot be made viable even after restructuring are prime candidates for privatisation, liquidation, or winding up.\nLessons from successful privatisation:Pakistan\u2019s main privatisation success stories are the banking and telecom sectors. In banking, the share of assets held by nationalised commercial banks declined from around 80pc to about 20pc following privatisation. Prior to 2003, the government injected Rs46 billion to recapitalise lossmaking banks; non-performing loans stood at 25pc, and financial soundness indicators were weak. Since privatisation, four major banks (HBL, UBL, MCB, and ABL) have contributed Rs245bn in corporate taxes in 2024 with cumulative contributions exceeding Rs1.6 trillion since 2004. NPLs have fallen below 7pc, provisioning exceeds 100pc, and overall financial soundness has improved.\nThe main weakness in recent years is the growing role of banks as public sector financiers, reflected in a declining advance-to-deposit ratio. Importantly, public sector banks such as the NBP and the Bank of Punjab have also improved under a competitive market structure and rank among the top 15 Asia-Pacific banks. The ideological argument that these institutions must also be privatised ignores the empirical evidence that ownership itself is not the decisive factor.\nPIA\u2019s case:Applying this framework (spelt out in the SOE Triage Report 2021) to PIA leads to a clear conclusion: there were no compelling public policy or market failure reasons for retaining it under government control. The aviation industry is competitive, and private operators have proved their capacity to perform effectively. Despite repeated restructuring efforts, PIA accumulated losses of Rs850bn. The privatisation objective was not short-term maximisation of sale proceeds but elimination of recurring losses and revival of the airline as an efficient enterprise. Over the longer term, improved performance under private management is expected to generate a steady stream of tax revenues rather than drain the exchequer. In sum, Pakistan needs an eclectic, evidence-based approach to SOEs, which transcends ideological divides and focuses squarely on public policy relevance, market structure, and financial viability.\nThe writer is a former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan.\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

      "fullText": "LAHORE: Iranian-American academic and political scientist Vali Nasr suggested on Friday that the war on Palestine had politically weakened Arab states and emboldened Israeli leaders, to the point that the latter had abandoned the two-state framework entirely.\nSpeaking at a session titled \u2018The Gaza War and the Remaking of the Middle East\u2019, moderated by journalist Najam Sethi, Mr Nasr implied that the situation has proven detrimental to the Palestinian cause.\nHe said Israel now believes it can pursue its objectives primarily through force. \u201cWith Arab states politically neutralised, Israeli leaders see little incentive to return to negotiations,\u201d he added.\nAccording to him, Israeli leadership now views political compromise with the Palestinians as a security liability rather than a pathway to stability, effectively abandoning the two-state framework.\nFollowing the Gaza war, Israelmovedagainst Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakening the group\u2019s operational capacity. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 further altered the regional balance.\nScholar notes Pakistan currently enjoying \u2018diplomatic honeymoon\u2019 with Washington, which won\u2019t last for long\nHamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, long aligned with Iran and regarded as part of the so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, were effectively dismantled.\n\u201cWith this strategic buffer around Israel gone, Israeli policymakers believed they could confront Iran more directly,\u201d the political scientist said, referring to Israeli-US militarystrikeson Iran in October 2024.\nHe said Arab states have also seen their influence in regional affairs diminish, leaving them increasingly sidelined. Israel, Mr Nasr argued, has concluded that military strength is now its primary guarantee of security.\nAs Iran\u2019s regional influence declined, Arab and Muslim countries reassessed Tehran\u2019s strategic importance as a symbol, pillar, and financier of resistance. \u201cSaudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey moved to restore and strengthen ties with Iran, recognising its symbolic and geopolitical counterweight to Israel,\u201d he said.\nMr Nasr also said the events of Oct 7, 2023 marked a turning point that reshaped regional politics and power dynamics. \u201cIn many ways, everything in the Middle East changed on that day,\u201d he said.\nUntil then, he explained, US strategy in the region centred on normalising Saudi-Israeli relations, expanding the Abraham Accords, building regional trade corridors, and linking Middle Eastern economies with Europe and India while bypassing China.\n\u201cThe events of October 7 pushed the Palestinian issue, which the US and many regional allies had put on the back burner, back to the centre of global attention,\u201d Mr Nasr said, adding that Israel\u2019s security doctrine has since undergone a fundamental shift.\nHe also criticised the \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d initiative announced by US President Donald Trump, calling it ineffective because it excludes Palestinians. According to Mr Nasr, several participating countries joined mainly to maintain favourable relations with Trump rather than to advance a genuine peace process.\nDespite the shifting landscape, the political scientist said key questions remain unresolved.\n\u201cThe future of Gaza is still unclear. There are also uncertainties surrounding the role of a potential Pakistan-Saudi defence partnership and how Iran and Turkey will manage their competing interests in Syria,\u201d he said.\nHowever, he concluded that the regional balance of power has already undergone a historic shift. \u201cThe Middle East has entered a new phase, and this transformation may well be permanent,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Diplomatic honeymoon\u2019\nIn a separate discussion, titled \u2018Pakistan: Between the USA and China\u2019, Mr Nasr argued against the view that China\u2019s rise is irreversible and America\u2019s decline is inevitable, advising middle powers such as Pakistan to focus on strengthening their own technological and economic foundations.\nSharing the stage with former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and journalist Raza Rumi, Mr Nasr described Pakistan\u2019s current relationship with Washington as a diplomatic \u201choneymoon\u201d, which had so far helped shield Islamabad from difficult questions regarding its strategic ties with China and its defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cThis relationship has also helped Pakistan avoid scrutiny over its conflict with India, largely because it played its diplomatic cards well,\u201d he said.\nNoting that Pakistan had also benefited from the recent strain in US-India ties, Mr Nasr cautioned that this favourable phase may not last long.\n\u201cThe United States effectively has two centres of power \u2014 one represented by the White House and the other by permanent institutions such as the State Department and the Pentagon,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPakistan is currently engaging mainly with the White House and benefiting from it, but the institutional system is likely to reassert itself and reopen uncomfortable discussions.\u201d\nMs Khar largely agreed with Nasr\u2019s assessment, and called for Pakistan to deepen its alignment with China \u2014 which she described as more predictable and consistent in its diplomacy \u2014 while maintaining constructive relations with the United States.\n\u201cThe US remains a global superpower and Pakistan must remain on the right side of Washington,\u201d she said, but warned policymakers not to assume that this situation would last.\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2026",

In some localities, residents receive water only once a day for a few hours. Balochistan faced a prolonged drought from 1998 to 2006.",
      "fullText": "For more than three decades, Muhammad Jahangir Khan has lived on Jamiat Rai Street off Spinny Road, a settled neighbourhood in Quetta with the basic markers of an urban locality. The area has gas and electricity connections, and most streets are paved. Yet in 2026, his house has still never been connected to a water pipeline.\nLike many of his neighbours, Jahangir plans his household routine around the arrival of a private water tanker, an expense that was once considered temporary but has long become permanent. What was once seen as an exception has quietly become the norm, as the experience is no longer confined to informal settlements.\nAcross Quetta, even residents of established urban localities are surviving without a regular public water supply. Instead, they are relying on private arrangements rather than a functioning municipal system.\nTo top it all off, unregulated use of tube wells, many of them illegally installed, has significantly worsened Quetta\u2019s water crisis. Excessive pumping to compensate for weak public supply has rapidly depleted groundwater reserves, with extraction far exceeding natural recharge in the arid region.\nBehind people\u2019s daily struggles lies a deeper structural crisis rooted in geography, climate and policy failure. Despite covering nearly 44 per cent of Pakistan\u2019s landmass, Balochistan receives less than 200mm of annual rainfall, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. Data from the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) shows that agriculture depends on groundwater for over 90 per cent of its needs, while only five per cent of farmland is connected to canal irrigation.\nIn Quetta, groundwater levels are falling by two to five metres annually, driven by unchecked extraction, including more than 30,000 illegal tube wells, per the Balochistan Agriculture Department. Moreover, a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) shows that the water table has dropped from about 50 metres in 2,000 to over 150 metres by 2023, posing a serious threat to agriculture and livelihoods.\nInSeptember last year, Commissioner of Quetta Division Shahzaib Khan Kakar and Deputy Commissioner of Quetta Captain (Retd) Mehrullah Badini warned that the water shortage in the provincial capital was worsening with each passing day, urging joint action by the government and citizens. \u201cWe are going to announce a water emergency in Quetta,\u201d they cautioned.\nFor residents, the problem is neither new nor unheard of. Jahangir said people living on his street have repeatedly submitted applications to elected representatives for pipeline installation, but their complaints were ignored, and no action was taken.\nFareed Bugti, a social activist living in the Nawa Kili Teachers Colony of Quetta, toldDawnthat his neighbourhood is also deprived of basic facilities.\n\u201cThe Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa) installed a water pipeline in my area 10 years ago, but supply from these pipelines has not been restored to date,\u201d Bugti said.\nAccording to Bugti, the population of Nawa Kili has exceeded 200,000, yet the area relies on just two government-owned tube wells, which serve only Mandokhelabad and Pashtunistan Chowk.\n\u201cCitizens have installed hundreds of tube wells themselves without obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the local administration, due to which the groundwater level is decreasing day by day,\u201c he said. \u201cAnd areas where there are no tube wells, people are forced to depend entirely on private tankers.\u201d\nEven where water is supplied, it is irregular. In some localities, residents receive water only once a day for a few hours, while others get a supply once a week.\nWhile some areas have seen limited intervention, relief remains uneven and fragile. Shahryar Kasi, a resident of Shaldara on Kasi Road, said water shortages in the area were once severe. \u201cWasa used to supply water after a week or 10 days, and even that would stop within minutes,\u201d he said.\nHe added that during the tenure of the previous government, a tube well was installed on Kasi Road, easing shortages in the surrounding areas. \u201cNow we get water once a day, which has provided clear relief,\u201d he added.\nThe situation, however, has not improved uniformly throughout the city, with many areas receiving water only once a week.\nKhair Muhammad Dehwar, a resident of Kalat Street in the Jail Road area, said water supply deteriorated after Balochistan faced a prolonged drought from 1998 to 2006.\n\u201cSome tube wells installed by the government were damaged, but they never got repaired,\u201d he said, adding that Wasa later refused to take over certain wells, citing insufficient groundwater.\n\u201cWasa provides water once a week for half an hour or an hour, but due to low pressure, it does not reach houses at the end of the streets,\u201d Dehwar said. \u201cAs a result, about 60 per cent of households have to order private tankers.\u201d\nIn Pashtunabad, resident Rehmatullah Durrani said water is supplied for about an hour a day through a tube well installed at a school. \u201cIf it develops a fault and is not repaired, residents are forced to call tankers,\u201d he said.\nIn several neighbourhoods, even state-led interventions have failed to deliver equitable access. Umair Parkani, a resident of Killi Bangulzai in Quetta Saryab district, said his neighbourhood has relied on private tankers for years despite elected representatives from his area making repeated promises.\nA tube well installed during the previous government failed to supply water to the entire area due to insufficient groundwater. Although two damaged tube wells were later repaired, Parkani said water still does not reach his house. \u201cIt reaches only a few nearby streets. People living farther away still have no option but tankers.\u201d\nOthers have to keep paying the water bill despite their houses being largely deprived of water.\nMansoor Ahmed, a retired banker living in the Smungli Housing Scheme of the Quetta Development Authority (QDA), said he spends thousands of rupees monthly to purchase water from tankers. Like others, he too has a water supply connection in his house, but receives water for just less than an hour on alternate days. Yet, he has to pay for the whole month.\n\u201cEven then, I keep paying the water bill for a full month,\u201d Ahmed toldDawn, adding that the situation gets even worse during the summer months.\n\u201cPeople living in the area have no other option but to purchase water from the private tanker mafia,\u201d he lamented.\nConcern has also reached the judiciary. On October 15, the Balochistan High Court (BHC)expressedstrong disappointment over the severe shortage of drinking water in Hazara Town and surrounding areas, terming the deprivation of such a basic necessity a \u201cserious act of administrative negligence.\u201d\nA two-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Gul Hassan Tareen heard a petition, ordering immediate action from Wasa, the Public Health Engineering Department (PHE) and Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco). The court observed that residents were facing extreme difficulties due to poor inter-departmental coordination and funding delays.\nResidents of Hazara Town, appearing before the court, claimed that a private water supply mafia was illegally selling water through Wasa pipelines. They claimed that citizens were being charged Rs30,000-40,000 for illegal connections and monthly fees of Rs2,500-3,000.\nThe court ordered the cancellation of illegal contracts and directed authorities to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply to operational tube wells.\nDespite the court\u2019s orders, citizens said the situation could hardly improve.\nExperts say the crisis reflects long-standing failures in planning and regulation. Dr Munir Ahmed Babar, Professor at US-Pakistan Centre for Advanced Studies in Water (USPCAS-W) at Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, toldDawnthat Quetta\u2019s continued reliance on tube wells was fundamentally unsustainable.\n\u201cQuetta depends almost completely on groundwater, and that groundwater is going down by around one to 1.5 meters every year,\u201c he said. \u201cThis means that more water is being pumped out than nature can refill, while continuing to install tube wells \u2014 even solar-powered ones \u2014 is not sustainable.\u201d\nDr Babar compared groundwater to a bank account. \u201cQuetta keeps withdrawing without making deposits,\u201c he said, adding that with very low rainfall and almost no natural recharge, this approach will lead to dry wells, land subsidence, agricultural collapse and worsening drinking water shortages.\n\u201cSustainability is only possible if new tube wells are restricted or banned, illegal wells sealed, groundwater pumping is measured and priced, recharge dams are built, and rainwater harvesting is introduced.\n\u201cWithout regulation and recharge, Quetta is moving towards water exhaustion,\u201c he said.\nSpeaking about why alternative long-term water sources were not developed in the city earlier, he said, \u201cQuetta did not fail because solutions were unknown. It failed because of weak governance, lack of long-term planning, political interests, and dependence on groundwater, because it was cheap and easy,\u201c he said.\nHe added that urgent regulatory steps are needed to protect groundwater and ensure fair access. \u201cEvery tube well must be registered and metered, tanker businesses regulated, illegal extraction criminalised and recharge infrastructure prioritised. Quetta\u2019s water crisis is man-made, and only governance reform combined with conservation and recharge can reverse it.\u201d\nWasa Managing Director Mujeebur Rehman Kakar said the authority supplies water to just 51 per cent of Quetta\u2019s population, which makes about 1.275 million people.\n\u201cWe have 544 tube wells, of which 387 are functional,\u201d he toldDawn, adding that around 1,000 may be unauthorised.\nHe cited arid climate, low rainfall, poor geology, droughts, rapid urbanisation and weak monitoring as major contributors to the crisis.\nPHE Secretary Muhammad Hashim Ghilzai said Quetta requires 60 million gallons per day but receives only 31.575 million gallons.\nHe added that the Mangi Dam project, expected to be completed in March 2026, would initially supply 8.1 million gallons daily.\nAs pressure mounts to move beyond short-term fixes, officials say resolving Quetta\u2019s water crisis will require sustained political will, strict enforcement and long-term planning rather than ad hoc measures.\nDeputy Commissioner Quetta Captain (Retd) Badini said resolving the crisis would require sustained effort, expert input and strict enforcement.\n\u201cWe are keeping an eye on the installation of illegal tube-wells,\u201d Badini said, adding that the use of potable water for car-washing at homes and workshops had also been banned. He said efforts were underway to supply treated wastewater for irrigation, plantations and roadside trees.\n\u201cNo one uses fresh water for irrigation, providing water for roadside trees and for lawns in the houses,\u201d he said, adding that a drip system had been adopted for roadside plantations. He pointed to countries that avoid using groundwater, relying instead on rain, snowfall, rivers, lakes and dams to preserve underground reserves for future generations.\nBadini stressed the urgent need to raise awareness among farmers and other segments of society about conserving groundwater. \u201cWe have left nothing underground for the next generation,\u201d he said, noting how unrestricted solar-powered pumping had accelerated depletion.\nThe president of the Quetta Press Club, Irfan Saeed, also expressed serious concern over the crisis, questioning what future generations would inherit. Recalling his childhood, he said groundwater was once available at depths of just 15 to 20 feet and rose to 10 feet after rainfall.\n\u201cWater is life, and we are rapidly depriving it,\u201d he said, urging the construction of dams to store rain and floodwater for future use.\nHeader image: Women in Quetta push wheelbarrows loaded with water bottles amid a severe water crisis. \u2014 B K Yousafzai",

However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country.\nMeanwhile, on the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in the neighbouring country were directly linked to Islamabad\u2019s own interests.\nHe also said that Pakistan was engaging with US on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

That makes no sense,\u201d Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, toldAFP.\nAround 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September.\nTEPCO said on Wednesday it would \u201cproceed with careful verification of each plant facility\u2019s integrity\u201d and address any issues appropriately and transparently.\nKashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world\u2019s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.\nThe facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.\nHowever, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source.\nFourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January.\nKashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.\nNearly 15 years after the disaster, \u201cthe situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that\u2019s absolutely unacceptable\u201d, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator.\nThe vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades.\nHowever, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,\u201d Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, toldAFP.\nOn January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority.\nThe petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,\u201d it said.\n\u201cMaking many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo \u2026 is intolerable.\u201d Before the 2011 disaster \u2014 which killed around 18,000 people \u2014 nuclear power generated about a third of Japan\u2019s electricity.\nJapan\u2019s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks.\nAt Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test.\n\u201cSafety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,\u201d TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with theAsahidaily newspaper.\nJapan is the world\u2019s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.\nNearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil \u2014 a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power.\nUnder a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan\u2019s energy supply by 2040 \u2014 up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24.\nMeanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.",

In a social media post on Friday, he thanked Tehran\u2019s leaders, saying they had called off scheduled mass executions.\nOfficial puts death toll around 5,000; judiciary announces executions will go ahead\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, however, made it cler that local or international criminals would be punished. \u201cWe will not drag the country into war, but we will not let domestic or international criminals go unpunished,\u201d Ira\u00adn\u2019s state media quoted him as saying.\nOn Sunday, the judiciary indicated that executions may go ahead.\n\u201cA series of actions have been identified as Mohareb, which is among the most severe Islamic punishments,\u201d Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir told a presser.\nMohareb, an Islamic legal term meaning to wage war against God, is punishable by death under Iranian law.\nIn an interview with Politico on Saturday, Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to look for new leadership in Iran\u201d.\nThe Iranian official in the region said the verified death toll was unlikely to get much higher.\n\u201cThe final toll is not expected to increase sharply,\u201d the official said, adding that \u201cIsrael and armed groups abroad\u201d had supported and equipped those taking to the streets.\nThe Iranian government regularly blames unrest on foreign enemies, including the United States and Israel - an arch foe of the Islamic Republic which launched military strikes on Iran in June.\nHighest death toll in Kurdish areas\nThe Iranian official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, claimed some of the heaviest clashes and highest number of deaths were in the Iranian Kurdish areas in the country\u2019s northwest. Kurdish separatists have been active in those areas and flare-ups there have been among the most violent in past periods of unrest.\nSome sources said that armed Kurdish separatist groups sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq in a sign of foreign entities potentially seeking to take advantage of instability in the country.\nThe Norway-based Iranian Kurdish rights group Hengaw said some of the heaviest clashes during protests that erupted in late December were in Kurdish areas in the northwest.\nMeanwhile, Iranian authorities said internet access was being gradually restored.\nSome internet access has been restored in Iran, a monitor said on Sunday. \u201cTraffic data indicate a significant return to some online services including Google, suggesting that heavily filtered access has been enabled, corroborating user reports of partial restoration,\u201d Netblocks said in a social media post.\nThe Tasnim news agency earlier reported \u201cthe relevant authorities announced that internet access would be gradually restored\u201d, but gave no further details.\nOn Sunday morning, some foreign news agencies were able to connect to the internet from its Tehran office, though the vast majority of internet providers and mobile internet remain cut. Outgoing international calls have been possible since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored on Saturday morning.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

A search operation was underway amid fears of further casualties at the time of going to press.\nOfficials initially suspected an electrical short-circuit, but said the cause was yet to be confirmed.\nThe fire spread rapidly, fuelled by combustible mat\u00aderial stored in around 1,200 shops in the ground-plus-three-storey building, spr\u00adead over 8,000 square yards.\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people had gathered aro\u00adund the building, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.\nParts of the building collapsed during the firefighting operation. Tra\u00adders\u2019 bodies estimated financial losses of up to Rs25 billion and claiming that 5,000 people worked in the shops.\nSindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the fire and fix responsibility.\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that six men, aged in their 20s and 30s, were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. Post-mortem examinations were conducted and the cause of death was declared inhalation injuries and burns, she said.\nMoreover, 26 men, aged 18 to 45, were brought for treatment, with 11 suffering burn injuries, she said, adding that all were discharged after first aid as none of them had suffered critical injuries.\nShe said \u201cmass disaster protocols\u201d had been activated at hospitals after officials provided a list of missing persons, including women and children, and warned that the death toll could rise.\nRescue 1122 spokesperson Hass\u00ada\u00adanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that they received the initial call at around 1:38am on Sunday. He said rescuers were first told the fire started in a shop dealing in artificial flowers on the ground floor before spreading to the basement and upper levels.\nHe said the building housed shops containing clothing, plastic goods, suitcases and chemicals used for perfumes and cosmetics, while the top level had a roof and parking area.\nRescue teams, including those from Rescue 1122, the Karachi Met\u00adropolitan Corporation fire brigade, Pakistan Navy and the Karachi Port Trust, rescued around 50 people safely on Saturday-Sunday night, he said.\nAnother 20 people were rescued in injured condition, but three later died. Mr Khan said two bodies were recovered from debris late on Sunday night, while a 25-year-old firefighter, Furqan Ali, lost his life when part of the building collapsed and debris fell on him.\nHe said the intensity of the blaze had weakened the pillars, and the rear portion of the building had already collapsed, with the remaining half of the structure at risk.\nQuoting Sindh Building Control Authority officials, he said the building was constructed in the 1990s and an additional floor was added in 2003.\n59 missing; Rs25bn losses\nSouth DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police had a list of 59 missing persons. \u201cSo far, we have shortlisted seven of them based on their call details,\u201d he said, adding that their phones were last traced to the plaza before being switched off.\nSindh Chief Minister Shah, Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, IGP Javed Alam Odho and other senior officials visited the site and reviewed the rescue operation.\nMeanwhile, All City Tajir Ittehad, an alliance of traders\u2019 bodies, said in a statement that its representatives estimated losses of Rs20bn to Rs25bn, including the value of goods and reconstruction costs.\n\u201cThis is not only the destruction of a building but a source of livelihood for thousands,\u201d it said, insisting that over 5,000 people worked in more than 1,200 shops.\nPresident, PM grieve\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday expressed sorrow over the death of firefighter Furqan Ali, praising his bravery and offering condolences to the bereaved family, according to a statement from the President\u2019s Secretariat.

      "fullText": "WHILE the US may want regime change in Iran, and Israel the collapse of the established order, internal strife and chaos, it appears that Tehran hasstayed safe from US-led military strikes, for the time being at least, because any such action seems less imminent now than it did earlier this week.\nSpeculation abounds about what made US President Donald Trump change his mind \u2014 from entreaties by Gulf friends, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, to a seemingly bizarreNew York Timesreportthat claimed that the apartheid state\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also asked the US leader not to launch military strikes for the time being.\nHowever, in Trump\u2019s own words \u201cnobody\u201d made him change his mind and it was the staying of 800 hangings of protesters that Iran had supposedly planned that was the main reason he had called off the strikes and also because the protesters\u2019 \u201ckilling has stopped\u201d.\nWhatever led to the pause, temporary or permanent, it is a welcome development for the region, which seemed to be sliding towards strife, with worries in the Gulf about Iran\u2019s possible retaliatory missile strikes against American military bases and, who knows, even economic infrastructure such as oil and gas facilities.\nPakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country\u2019s western borders.\nPerhaps, the most serious challenges would have come Pakistan\u2019s way in either a regime change or collapse-chaos scenario. In the case of regime cha\u00ad\u00ad\u00adnge, it would not have been surprising to see an administration in Tehran sympathetic to Isra\u00ad\u00adel. That would have meant a hostile entity like Israeli intelligence enjoying far greater access to Iran than, for example, Indian intelligence has at present.\nPakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons are like a sty in Israel\u2019s eye. And, therefore, you can well imagine the consequences of the latter\u2019s intelligence sitting on our nearly 1,000-kilometre border with Iran, adding to our existing security concerns due to the situation on the Indian and Afghan borders. Coastal security would be another concern.\nIn the other scenario, where a central authority collapse would lead to chaos and fragmentation, it would be reasonable to assume that Iran\u2019s Sistan-Baluchestan province would be one of the regions affected by any such development, which, in turn, would lead to even more issues across our common, often porous, border.\nWith the same ethnicity straddling the border, you can well imagine the boost the insurgency in our Balochistan could get from the collapse of the central authority in Iran. Israel has enhanced its security through internal strife in Syria. It is the Mossad playbook for all states around it who are not in its pocket.\nSo, Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country\u2019s western borders and up the coast, in the short run at least. But Trump\u2019sdecision to impose another 25 per cent tariffon anyone doing business with Iran will deepen the crisis in the sanctions-clamped nation.\nIt was the economic crisis, with the rapidly falling value of the Iranian currency and inflation, that triggered the recent round of street protests. There can be no doubt that the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was involved in arming and instigating some of the protesters as the former CIA chief and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo openly tweeted, but the protests erupted due to the economic mess where even purchasing bread is becoming a problem.\nThis fact was acknowledged by Iran\u2019s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who said the government needed to address the legitimate concerns of the protesters who had a right to take to the streets. Now a new budget is expected to be presented before parliament to replace the earlier proposal rejected by it. But then, the protests turned violent and the security services were ordered to crack down.\nSome Tehran-based sources say the protests were peaceful till some elements from among the protesters fired at the security forces and also attacked infrastructure. These sources claimed that, of the 2,000 people killed, some 700 were law-enforcement officers. But these claims were impossible to verify independently.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs on top of sanctions could create further problems for the Iranian leadership as even the thus far recalcitrant India is having second thoughts about doing business with Iran and haspulled out of the Chabahar port project, which it saw as vital to expanding its trade ties all the way to Central Asia.\nWith the exception of China and Russia, additional US tariffs would be sufficient to discourage the smaller economies from trading with Iran, which would worsen the resource crunch in that country. The oppressive Iranian regime has some serious thinking to do over the coming weeks.\nThe immediate threat of US-Israeli military action may have receded somewhat but the economic crisis is going to worsen. Iran may consider easing restrictions on how women should be attired and create more space for peaceful expression of dissent as a means of reducing tensions within its society.\nSide by side, it should consider what price tag it wants to attach to its nuclear programme. With its successful and lethal missile programme, it has already gained a degree of effective defence. Only Iran can tell if stopping its enrichment programme in exchange for lifting of sanctions and economic relief is worthwhile.\nIf its missile stockpile, particularly of the hypersonic variant, is what prompted many of its Gulf neighbours and, by some accounts, even Israel, to ask the US not to provoke it by attacking, Iran\u2019s defence shield seems to be working. Only the decision-makers in Tehran will know if that is enough or whether their pursuit of nuclear weapons is non-negotiable.\nTheir past experience of doing a deal with the Obama administration in 2015 to cap enrichment that Trump later annulled is not encouraging. Even then, it\u2019s not clear what other options a country facing economic ruin and internal strife can exercise.\nThe writer is former editor of Dawn.\nabbas.nasir@hotmail.com\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

Experts studying the crash site say a faulty rail joint may be key to determining the cause of the crash.\n\u201cThe train tipped to one side... then everything went dark, and all I heard was screams,\u201d said Ana Garcia Aranda, 26, who was travelling back to Madrid and was being treated at a Red Cross centre in Adamuz. Limping and wrapped in a blanket, her face covered with plasters, she described how fellow passengers dragged her out of the train covered in blood.\nFirefighters rescued her pregnant sister from the wreckage and an ambulance took them both to hospital.\nThere were people who were fine and others who were very, very badly injured. You had them right in front of you and you knew they were going to die, and you couldn\u2019t do anything, she said.\nThe collision occurred in a hilly, olive-growing region which could only be accessed by a single-track road, making it difficult for ambulances to enter and exit, Iigo Vila, national emergency director at the Spanish Red Cross, said.\nEmergency teams were struggling to bring in heavy machinery that could lift the wreckage to get access to more of the dead, the Andalusia region\u2019s President Juan Manuel Moreno said.\nPM cancels Davos trip\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez cancelled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Transport Minister Oscar Puente visited the crash site on Monday. Police drone footage showed how the trains came to a standstill 500 metres apart. One train\u2019s carriage was split in two, and the locomotive was crushed like a tin can.\nExperts studying the crash site found a broken joint on the rails, which created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track, according to a source briefed on initial investigations into the disaster. The technicians believe the faulty joint could prove important in identifying the precise cause of the accident, the source said.\nSpain\u2019s Commission of Investigation of Rail Accidents (CIAF), which has been tasked with the overall investigation into the causes of the disaster, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nPublished in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: Despite over 35 years of \u2018reforms\u2019 and policy interventions, Pakistan\u2019s power sector remains incapable of instilling confidence in the country\u2019s economic growth and in consumers\u2019 trust, leading to gains secured from power producers through renegotiations evaporating amid unending inefficiencies.\nThis charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship \u2018State of the Industry Report 2025\u2019, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.\nIt said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.\nIt said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, \u201coverall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development\u201d.\nNepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt\nIt pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).\nOn the distribution side, many go\u00ad\u00advernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com\u00adme\u00adrcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie\u00adncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con\u00adtribute to the circular debt problem.\nIt said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. \u201cPersistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector\u2019s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth\u201d, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector\u2019s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.\nThe regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.\nIt appreciated the government\u2019s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. \u201cConsequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs\u2019 tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms\u201d.\nOn top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal.\nReduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.\nA notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.\nThe regulator put on record that \u201cKE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators\u201d.\nOperational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.\nIt said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.\nAs if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator\u2019s monitoring and enforcement drive had \u201cbeen diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions\u201d. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator\u2019s monitoring and enforcement efforts.\nPublished in Dawn, January 17th, 2026",

      "fullText": "NEPRA\u2019S latest state of the industry report tells the familiar story of failed reform in the power sector due to patchy execution, misgovernance, corruption, underinvestment, and unpredictable policy. It also recounts how this reform failure has burdened honest consumers, led to blackouts despite surplus generation, and dragged down the economy. Numerous policy interventions, unbundling and corporatisation of SOEs, and private investments in generation notwithstanding, the sector continues to face challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its role in national economic growth, instead of providing relief to consumers across different categories.\nIn fact, the power sector\u2019s credibility is at its lowest point as even several policy resets have not been able to correct the situation. So, it is no surprise that whatever financial gains the state extracted from private power producers through coercion and renegotiation were quickly swallowed by deep-seated inefficiencies elsewhere in the system. No wonder, electricity remains unaffordable, supplies patchy and a big portion of generation capacity idle, with consumers forced to underwrite losses stemming from systemic failure. The scale of the sector\u2019s challenges and their implications for consumers is reflected in the fact that the distribution companies have added some Rs400bn to the circular debt, while consumers paid about Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge during the last fiscal year because the sector\u2019s inefficiencies have been allowed to persist and cascade across the supply chain: from generation to transmission to distribution. Consumers are not only shouldering the financial burden of these inefficiencies, they are being forced to bear the costs of delayed connections and being overbilled. The Nepra report also admits that the regulator\u2019s own authority has diminished over time. Regulatory powers have been steadily eroded through administrative interference and prolonged litigation, rendering enforcement actions slow, reversible and largely symbolic. This raises an important question: can a sector plagued by weak governance and lack of accountability be fixed through pricing tweaks and contract revisions when experience suggests otherwise? The sector does not suffer from a lack of actionable plans for reform. What it needs is political will to execute those reform plans, improve governance and accountability, end policy uncertainty and strengthen the regulator.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

Before this drop, prices had increased by 4.4pc during October and November.\nKarachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, reported distribution-stage system losses of 12.55pc, up from 10.6pc a couple of months earlier. Meanwhile, Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), supplying gas to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported system losses of nearly 9pc at the distribution stage, compared to 7.47pc in October.\nAccording to the notification, the RLNG sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage declined by 4.62pc to $10.41 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for January 2026, from $10.92 per mmBtu in December 2025 and $11.24 in September.\nAs a result, the sale price at the distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 4.68pc to $11.27 per mmBtu for January, compared to $11.83 in December and $12.24 in November.\nOn the other hand, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL at the transmission stage decreased by 5.25pc to $8.98 per mmBtu for January, from $9.47 in December, $10.065 in November and $9.86 in September.\nThe distribution-stage sale price for SSGCL was also reduced by 5.26pc to $10.21 per mmBtu for the current month, compared to $10.77 in December, $11.45 in November and $11.01 in September.\nOgra said the reduction in RLNG prices was due to a decrease in the delivered ex-ship (DES) price.

He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.\nThis resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.\nThe minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.\nHe said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.\nMr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps \u2014 both low recoveries and high losses \u2014 were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers\u2019 money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.\nThe minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.\nHe said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.\nHe agreed with the Nepra\u2019s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under \u2018take or pay\u2019 or \u2018must run\u2019 agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.\n\u2018Without due diligence\u2019\nResponding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.\n\u201cWe have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan\u2019s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,\u201d he said.\nThe minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.\nHe also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. \u201cIn the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,\u201d he said.\nHe also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was \u2018a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos\u2019. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.\nHe said the Discos\u2019 recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.\nCircular debt\nContesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator\u2019s \u201cunderstanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising\u201d.\nHe said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.\nMost importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. \u201cK-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric\u2019s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.\nThe receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,\u201d the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.\nResponding to Nepra\u2019s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.\nInterestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared topetrol and dieselwhich are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.\nIn the last week of November 2025, Ogra haddeterminedup to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra\u2019s determination within 40 days.\nThe minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan hadconcludedsuccessful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac\u00adh\u00aded to manage excess supplies.\nMNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector\u2019s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.\nThe minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been \u201cquelled\u201d, which was a critical reform measure.\nSui gas companies\u2019 managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.\nThe Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.\nCommittee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.\nOfficials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.\nNo domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.\nThe committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.\nThe minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.\nThe committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2026",

      "fullText": "THE world has entered what the UN has termed an era of \u201cwater bankruptcy\u201d. The phrase is not to be sidelined as over-the-top rhetoric. In many regions, societies have been drawing down water far faster than nature can replenish. Resultantly, rivers, aquifers, glaciers and wetlands have been exhausted in ways that are no longer reversible. The UN University\u2019s latest report warns that water systems across continents are already in a post-crisis state, where one can no longer count on recovery after a drought or flood. This global condition carries particular urgency for Pakistan \u2014 a lower-riparian, semi-arid state whose economy, food security and social stability depend overwhelmingly on the Indus basin. Climate change has intensified floods and droughts alike, accelerated glacier melt in the upper reaches of the basin, and worsened groundwater depletion across the plains. Rapid population growth, inefficient irrigation and poor urban water management have pushed demand well beyond sustainable limits. In the language of the UN report, Pakistan has been spending not just its annual \u201cwater income\u201d but also its long-term \u201csavings\u201d. Against this backdrop, India\u2019s decision to place the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance is deeply troubling. For more than six decades, the treaty provided predictability, data-sharing and dispute-resolution mechanisms in one of the world\u2019s most heavily used transboundary river systems. Pakistan\u2019s warning at the UN that unilateral actions and information withholding amount to the weaponisation of water should be taken seriously. In an era of water bankruptcy, uncertainty only deepens the crisis, making it harder to plan for agriculture, electricity generation and flood control.\nYet it would be a mistake to see Pakistan\u2019s water predicament through the lens of external threats alone. Even if the treaty remains intact, the country faces an internal reckoning. Bankruptcy management, as the UN report makes clear, is not about returning to a lost past but about adapting honestly to new hydrological realities. That means rethinking crop choices, pricing and subsidies, investing in groundwater regulation and recharge, protecting ecosystems, and modernising irrigation. The coming years will be decisive. With global water risks rising and regional cooperation under strain, Pakistan must prepare for scarcity as a fact of life. Preventing a full-blown water collapse will demand diplomacy abroad, discipline at home and the political courage to act while we can.\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

May God give them more life.\u201d\nAccording to a list shared withDawnaround the same time, the South district office had received reports of 53 missing people from their families so far.\nThe Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.\nA separate statement by the South Zone police also listed the following helpline contact numbers: 021-99205670, 021-99201196 and 021-99205691.\nHundreds of people had gathered around the building today, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.\nDuring his media talk, CM Murad noted that the mall was a three-storey building with a basement and housed more than 1,000 shops.\nWhile the chief minister noted that the cause of the fire could not be ascertained for sure at this stage, he said a short circuit was being blamed for igniting the blaze in a shop with flammable material.\nTerming it a \u201cvery upsetting\u201d incident, he stressed that authorities were making efforts to find missing people.\nThe Sindh CM detailed that around 26 fire tenders, 10 bowsers and multiple snorkels took part in the fire extinguishing operations.\nCM Murad, citing what he had been informed, said an alert about the fire was received at 10:16pm, and the first fire tender had reached the site at 10:27pm.\n\u201cAll municipal authorities acted immediately, according to what I have been informed, and all these things will be verified.\u201d\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday spoke CM Murad over the telephone to inquire about the latest situation of the fire, stressing the need to use all available resources to ensure the success of rescue and firefighting operations, a statement from the President\u2019s House said.\n\u201cThe president also paid tribute to firefighter Farqan Shaukat, who lost his life in the blaze, and asked the Sindh government to nominate him for a civil award.\u201d\nHe directed authorities to ensure proper medical care for the injured and take immediate steps for the rehabilitation of affected families, while emphasising strict enforcement of fire safety laws and the modernisation of safety inspection mechanisms in commercial and residential buildings to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nA statement from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said PM Shehbaz Sharif also inquired about the incident over the phone, offering all kinds of assistance to the provincial government from the Centre.\nPointing out that the mall was constructed in the 1980s, he said, \u201cI admit that we could not control the deterioration that, without any study, multi-level buildings were allowed. And now if we stop them, the builders make a fuss that they are being bothered.\u201d\nHe highlighted that many buildings do not have materials to extinguish fire available inside the buildings, and stressed the need for fire exits to be properly marked.\nAt around 4pm, South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso toldDawnthat the fire had been brought under control by up to 70pc.\nSpeaking toGeo News, DC Khoso said authorities were gathering information about the number of people trapped inside the building.\n\u201cWe have cordoned off the area and are trying to extinguish the blazes phase-wise,\u201d he said.\nRescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Abid Jalal toldGeo Newsin the afternoon that \u201cfirefighting is underway from all three sides\u201d.\nHe also said that the fire had been brought under control by about 70-75pc.

Therefore, he added, the team\u2019s strategy was to control the fire first and then begin the search once they were able to enter the mall.\nCOO Jalal detailed that over 125 people, including firefighters, were engaged in the ongoing operations and about 20-22 vehicles of the fire brigade were involved.\nADawnNewsTVcorrespondent present at the site reported that all sides of the mall had been impacted, with one having \u201ccompletely collapsed\u201d.\nHe added that several people had come to look for their relatives, including shopkeepers working at the mall.\nDelhi Colony residents Mansoor and Jameel toldDawnNewsTVthat they were unable to contact six of their family members who had come to Gul Plaza last night for shopping.\nThey said their last contact was at around 10:10pm last night, after which their mobile numbers were not reachable.

A massive emergency response was launched, involving 22 fire brigade vehicles, 10 water bowzers, four snorkel vehicles, and 33 Rescue 1122 ambulances.\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed CM Murad and Wahab to deploy all resources to control the fire.\nExpressing grief over the loss of lives and property, he demanded an immediate probe into the blaze and ordered that steps be taken to prevent such future tragedies.\nSindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah visited the site of the incident earlier in the day to assess the rescue operations.\nThe South deputy commissioner and Rescue 1122 officials briefed him on the steps taken to control the fire.\nThe chief secretary issued orders for the deployment of all available fire tenders and additional rescue workers.\nSoon after the fire began, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had also visited Gul Plaza, where he was briefed on the rescue and relief operations.\nStanding alongside the traders whose shops were ablaze, the governor issued directives for the rehabilitation of the affected.\nPrior to his visit, in a statement from his office, Tessori expressed concern over the incident and ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations.\nHe also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.\nGul Plaza has witnessed fire incidents in the past as well.\nInAugust 2016, more than 25 shops were burnt in a huge fire that broke out in the multi-storey market. It was believed that a short circuit caused the fire.\nA fire at a warehouse in Gul Plaza inAugust 2008, also caused by an electric short-circuit, destroyed some goods. However, no casualty was reported.\nFires frequentlyeruptin buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence.

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: The cost of doing business in Pakistan is about 34 per cent higher than in regional economies, creating a serious competitiveness crisis for local industry, a business group said on Thursday.\nIn a statement, the Pakis\u00adtan Business Forum (PBF) said higher operating costs had \u201cseverely undermined\u201d the ability of local industries to compete in international markets.\nIt said that due to irrational taxation, excessive energy costs and currency instability, Pakist\u00adan\u2019s exporters were unable to match regional competitors, resulting instagnantexports since 2022 despite global trade recovery in several sectors.\nPBF Chairman Ahmad Jawad said that in the given scenario, Pakistani businesses were struggling to survive, let alone expand exports, as their cost structures remain misaligned with regional economies such as Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.\nMr Jawad emphasised that to address this alarming situation, Pakistan must immediately rationalise its taxation system, reduce the cost of electricity and gas for industry and adopt a clear policy aimed at strengthening and stabilising the rupee.\nPBF warns of competitiveness crisis, calls for tax, energy reforms\nHe said the rupee should be stabilised at Rs240 per dollar, saying that a stronger and more predictable exchange rate would help curb inflation, lower imported raw material costs, and bring stability to export orders. He recalled that continuous devaluation had failed to boost exports and had instead fuelled inflation, increased production costs and eroded business confidence.\nThe PBF noted with disappointment that over the last six years, the rupee had devalued by nearly Rs160 against the dollar, a situation that reflected poor economic management rather than market fundamentals.\n\u201cFor the time being, the rupee is holding its position, but when we look at the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, the current dollar price against the rupee is still excessively high and not truly market-driven,\u201d Mr Jawad said, adding that artificial devaluation had only benefited speculative elements while damaging productive sectors of the economy.\nHighlighting the crisis in the cotton sector, PBF Chairman for South and Central Punjab Malik Talat Suhail expressed grave concern over theclosureof more than 400 cotton ginning factories, which had disrupted the entire cotton value chain and negatively impacted farmers, ginners and the textile industry.\nMr Sohail said cotton ginners were not being provided with a level playing field due to the unjustified imposition of 18pc GST on local cottonseed and oil cake, which had increased costs and reduced demand for local cotton, ultimately causing financial losses to farmers.\nHe said cotton was one of the most important components of Pakistan\u2019s import bill, and removing the 18pc GST on cotton seed and oil cake would significantly encourage cotton cultivation in Punjab and Sindh, reduce dependency on imports and help revive the domestic cotton economy.\nHe urged the government to take immediate action and issue an SRO for the withdrawal of GST on cottonseed and oil cake by February, as early cotton harvesting begins by the end of next month.\nHe stressed that without timely policy intervention, Pakistan risks further decline in cotton production, continued closure of ginning factories and increased pressure on foreign exchange reserves.\nThe PBF warned that failure to implement urgent structural reforms will lead to long-term deindustrialisation, loss of export markets, rising unemployment and dee\u00adper economic instability.\nIt also called upon the federal government to engage with stakeholders and adopt pro-business, pro-export, and pro-farmer policies to restore competitiveness, revive exports and place Pakistan\u2019s economy back on a sustainable growth path.\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "fullText": "IQBAL works as a driver with a rent-a-car company. He is usually working six to seven days a week. The company pays him around Rs30,000 as salary. He does make some more as overtime, and though that amount varies by the month, on average he gets another Rs20,000 or so. Adding tips to the total, he makes around Rs65,000 per month. He has a wife and two children who are still in school.\nUp to a couple of years ago, Iqbal was able to save a bit every month from his income. But the inflation over the last few years has made his budget a lot more constrained. He is barely able to meet all his routine expenses now. Electricity and gas bills have increased a lot. And the food bill has also almost doubled. He is actively on the lookout for extra driving jobs now so that he can get more overtime payment. He has started skipping lunch unless a client is generous enough to give him lunch or money for lunch.\nThis is not an isolated case. In their article (\u2018People are eating less\u2019) in this paper last week, Zafar Mirza and Miftah Ismail, giving numbers from the Household Integrated Expenditure Survey 2024-25, have shown that people are indeed eating less and they have had to tighten their belts further to make ends meet. And this is true for not just lower-income groups but middle-income groups as well.\nWhat has made life a lot harder for Iqbal and his family has been a health shock. His wife has blood pressure and diabetes and has recently been diagnosed with some liver ailment. Doctor\u2019s fee, expenses for diagnostic testing and regular costs of medicines have pushed Iqbal into debt. He has been forced to borrow from his relatives, friends and any clients he felt would be kind enough to help him or lend him money.\nWe need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generation opportunities.\nEach month is a struggle now. Medical expenses are a constant addition to his monthly expenses, but his income has not gone up and there does not seem to be any prospect of income growth either. He has essentially fallen into a debt trap. He has accumulated a significant amount of debt, which there is little possibility of paying, and has no ability to raise further debt. But monthly expenses continue to be higher than his income.\nWhat is a person like Iqbal supposed to do?\nThis is not the story of just one household in Pakistan. It is the story of a significant proportion of the population of the country. If people have no savings, shocks can be devastating and can push households into debt and poverty. The most common shock seems to be health shocks. For a household of five to six people \u2014 the norm in Pakistan \u2014 with one or two earners, and with grandparents and children, health shocks are not a surprise at all.\nDiabetes, blood pressure, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and many other ailments \u2014 a lot of them requiring medium- to long-term and continued care \u2014 are quite common in Pakistan. With 40 per cent or so of children afflicted with malnutrition, youngsters falling ill is not unexpected either.\nThe state does not provide good healthcare facilities. Public sector provision is not only patchy and of poor quality in general, it is also not available everywhere. And private healthcare is expensive. Whenever Iqbal has taken his wife to the public hospital, he has been told to get diagnostic tests done from private laboratories and he has also had to pay for all the medicines. Only the doctor\u2019s fee is subsidised by the state. But diagnostic tests are quite expensive. Medicines, too, are expensive and have become even more costly over the last few years.\nDo bear in mind that we do not provide any income support through our social protection institutions and programmes to those who are above very low-income levels. The Benazir Income Support Programme is for the very poor and does not extend beyond. There are no programmes for the working or low-income poor.\nWhat could be the way out for Iqbal? Can he increase his income? He could try to work more hours. That is not easy though. He could pull out one or more of his children from school and push them into the workforce. But given the unemployment rates in the country, this is not much of an option, especially if the children are still in the early to middle stages of their education. And the loss in terms of a child not completing his or her education is seen in the medium- to long-term damage to the country.\nIt is at the level of the state that we can actually change things. In fact, it is the responsibility of the state to do so. A large proportion of Pakistanis have fallen on hard times, even a larger proportion has become more vulnerable to shocks than before. It is the responsibility of the state to do something about this. It is here, even in terms of intentions, that we do not find anything. We need to start thinking about how we can create more income-generating opportunities for people. And we need to think about extending support to those who are falling on hard times. Probably the best way to do this \u2014 and this is being done and has been done in many countries \u2014 is to extend health and education facilities of decent quality to all citizens, especially those who are struggling. This could help a lot of people in major ways. But, of course, in an elitist and elite-captured state, this will not happen easily. It will require a major overhaul of the governance system and governance ethos in the country. This, at least for now, does not seem to be on the horizon.\nThe writer is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives and an associate professor of economics at Lums.\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2026",

      "fullText": "MADRID: Real Madrid ended a turbulent week with a much-needed 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Levante on Saturday, courtesy of second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio, after being met with boos from a restless Bernabeu crowd before the breakthrough arrived.\nThe win snapped Real\u2019s two-match losing run and offered brief respite after a bruising week. They looked flat in the first half, still carrying the scars of Sunday\u2019s 3-2 Spanish Super Cup final defeat to rivals Barcelona, followed by the departure of manager Xabi Alonso the next day and a shock 3-2 Copa del Rey exit to second-division Albacete on Wednesday.\nBoos greeted the players at kick-off, with sections of the crowd also directing chants at club president Florentino Perez. Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week.\nReal finally eased the tension when Adrian de la Fuente tripped Mbappe in the box, and the French forward, was spared the jeers, converted the penalty in the 58th minute to extend his league-leading tally to 19 goals.\nMbappe, who appeared in pain in the warm up after a collision with team-mate Dean Huijsen, had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.\nSeven minutes later, Real doubled their advantage through centre-back Asencio, who rose to meet Arda Guler\u2019s corner with a powerful header to make it 2-0 in the 65th minute, giving new coach Alvaro Arbeloa a crucial cushion and settling the mood inside the stadium.\n\u201cToday was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,\u201d Asencio told Real Madrid TV. \u201cWhat happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better. The team gave a good account of themselves, above all in the second half. He [Arbeloa] asks us to enjoy ourselves -- to be protagonists, to  dominate, to focus on ourselves and not on the opposition. Little by  little, we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\nThe win keeps Real second in La Liga on 48 points from 20 matches, one behind leaders Barcelona, who have a game in hand and visit Real Sociedad on Sunday.

[They] need to come forward on their own.\u201d\nDuring his press conference, CM Murad detailed that a separate committee had been formed to assess traders\u2019 losses and make recommendations regarding businesses\u2019 rehabilitation.\nThe committee includes Zubair Motiwala, Jawed Bilwani, Idress Memon, Junaid Makda and Rehan Hanif.\nThe chief minister said it was decided to allocate a space temporarily to the affected businesses.\nThe Sindh CM said shopkeepers\u2019 associations will be asked to install fire alarms, stressing that the first \u201cone to two hours\u201d after a fire occurs were crucial.\nPrior to the press conference, CM Murad had held a meeting with representatives of the traders\u2019 community where he vowed to immediately rehabilitate the affected businesses.\n\u201cWe will reconstruct the building of Gul Plaza,\u201d he announced, according to a statement from his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.\n\u201cThe Sindh government will have a forensic report conducted so the cause of the fire can be known,\u201d CM Murad said, adding that the chief secretary would notify the fact-finding committee.\nHighlighting that President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were repeatedly contacting him about the incident, the chief minister said, \u201cThe PPP leadership wants the traders of Gul Plaza to be rehabilitated urgently.\u201d\nLocal Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah said the restoration efforts would be undertaken with the advice of the traders.\nCommissioner Naqvi informed the meeting that the death toll could surge to over 50. CM Murad, after being told that the cooling process was underway, ordered that the work to clear the rubble be initiated right away.\nKarachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab briefed the chief minister that 16 fire tenders and bowsers were involved in the dousing operations, in which \u201c50 to 60\u201d firefighters participated.\nHe further said that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) had provided tankers and 431,000 gallons of water for the fire-extinguishing operations.\nCM\u2019s aide Giyan Chand Essarani informed the meeting that the blaze erupted at 10:36pm on January 17, adding that Rescue 1122 ambulances reached the site within six minutes.\nHe further said that a total of 24 fire rescue vehicles took part in the operations, including those of KMC and the Pakistan Navy.\nThe Sindh government also established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.\nSindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, said that the incident had now \u201cturned into a national tragedy\u201d.\n\u201cInformation about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,\u201d he said.\nHe further stated that while determining the cause of the fire was necessary, the priority for now was to save lives. \u201cI am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,\u201d he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders.\nTessori vowed to \u201cstand with the affected people\u201d until their losses are fully compensated.\n\u201cMy cousin was inside,\u201d said Raheel Ibrahim about Naveed Juma, who he said used to work at a shop on Gul Plaza\u2019s first floor.\n\u201cHis phone was ringing till 12am [on Saturday] but he did not receive calls,\u201d he said, adding that his cousin\u2019s phone was unreachable afterwards.\n\u201cTill now there is no news of him,\u201d Ibrahim said, adding that his 43-year-old cousin had three young daughters.\nAnother elderly man from the Metroville area said his daughter, daughter-in-law and sister had come to the mall for shopping on Saturday.\n\u201cWe have had no contact with them after 8pm that night,\u201d he added.\nThe distraught man lamented, \u201cWherever we go, they push us away like a football that \u2018ask so and so, we do not know anything\u2019.\u201d\nNoting that some bodies were unidentifiable and needed DNA samples for cross-matching, the man said he was being told that details about that process would take two to three days.\nIn an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza.\nThe traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower.\nCommuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or Mazar-i-Quaid from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal Market, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road.\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriot said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza.\n\u201cMay strength be with the community at this time,\u201d she said.\nThe Turkish Embassy in Islamabad said it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d.\n\u201cThe Turkish Embassy stands in solidarity with friendly and brotherly people of Pakistan in this difficult time,\u201d it said, conveying condolences to the bereaved families.\nThe Russian Embassy also expressed its \u201cheartfelt condolences and profound sorrow\u201d over the fire incident, as well as the recent Sargodha and Ormaratraffic accidents.\nThe German Consulate in Karachi, in a post on X, said the incident at Gul Plaza was deeply saddening. \u201cOur thoughts & prayers are with the victims, their families, and those injured.\u201d\nThe French embassy in Pakistan expressed \u201cprofound sorrow over the loss of many lives in the devastating fire\u201d.\n\u201cWe offer our sincere condolences to the bereaved families and stand with the people of Pakistan in this moment of grief,\u201d the embassy said on X.\nThe terrifyingfirethat erupted at Gul Plaza on Saturday night could have been contained sooner, but thedelayed responseand limited resources from the authorities allowed the blaze to rage unchecked for hours.\nTraders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.\nShopkeepers at the site toldDawnthat if the firefighting team had arrived with full force and resources, the scene would probably look very different.\nOne shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.\nA local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.\nPeople criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.\nAdditional input by Asim Khan",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: Pakistan posted a current account deficit (CAD) of $1.174 billion during the first half of 2025-26 compared with a surplus of $957 million in the same period last year, the State Bank said on Monday.\nThe government has projected a CAD of around $2.1bn, or within 0-1 per cent of GDP, for FY26, anticipating higher imports driven by economic growth.\nExperts believe the changing geopolitical situation could disrupt oil prices, putting pressure on Pakistan\u2019s balance of payments as the country relies entirely on imported oil. They warn that any renewed conflict in the Middle East, such as an attack on Iran, could suddenly affect supply chains and push oil prices higher. Rising oil prices would further worsen the country\u2019s current account imbalance.\nThe State Bank and the government believe that higher imports contribute to the current account deficit, with oil accounting for the largest share of imports. In FY25, the country spent $15bn on petroleum product imports out of total imports of $59bn. Despite these imports, the current account recorded a surplus of $2bn.\nSwelling trade deficit driven by higher imports turns current account red\nOn Monday, international crude oil prices ranged between $59 and $63 per barrel and remained volatile amid fears of a possible attack on Iran.\nAccording to the SBP data, the current account posted a surplus of $98 million in November, but turned into a deficit of $244m in December. Both quarters of the current fiscal year recorded deficits: $737m during July-September and $437m during October-December.\nAlthough the State Bank\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have improved during the current financial year, they remain insufficient to cover petroleum imports for the entire year. During the first half of FY26, the country spent $7.1bn on petroleum product imports, compared to $7.3bn in the same period of FY25.\nThe government has set an export target of $60bn over three years, but exports depend 35 to 40pc on imported inputs. Weak manufacturing activity and declining cotton production have increased the import bill. Pakistan imported cotton worth $2.3bn in FY25, and production has declined again this year, indicating that more dollars will be required to boost exports. The textile sector remains the largest source of export earnings.\nThe current account surplus in FY25 helped stabilise market sentiment and the exchange rate, preventing panic in the dollar market.\nThe trade deficit widened from $14.5bn to $19.2bn in the first half of FY26, sending a clear signal about future trends. Apart from concerns over higher oil prices, the import bill is expected to continue rising as low GDP growth has increased pressure on the government. The government has been held responsible over the past three years for low GDP growth, which has pushed about 46pc of the population below the poverty line.\nPublished in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

That makes no sense,\u201d Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, toldAFP.\nAround 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September.\nTEPCO said on Wednesday it would \u201cproceed with careful verification of each plant facility\u2019s integrity\u201d and address any issues appropriately and transparently.\nKashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world\u2019s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.\nThe facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.\nHowever, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source.\nFourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January.\nKashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.\nNearly 15 years after the disaster, \u201cthe situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that\u2019s absolutely unacceptable\u201d, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator.\nThe vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades.\nHowever, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,\u201d Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, toldAFP.\nOn January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority.\nThe petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,\u201d it said.\n\u201cMaking many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo \u2026 is intolerable.\u201d Before the 2011 disaster \u2014 which killed around 18,000 people \u2014 nuclear power generated about a third of Japan\u2019s electricity.\nJapan\u2019s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks.\nAt Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test.\n\u201cSafety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,\u201d TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with theAsahidaily newspaper.\nJapan is the world\u2019s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.\nNearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil \u2014 a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power.\nUnder a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan\u2019s energy supply by 2040 \u2014 up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24.\nMeanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.",

      "fullText": "The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) on Friday warned that Pakistan\u2019s industrial sector was facing asevere crisisdue to high energy tariffs and heavy taxation, leading to widespread factory closures and job losses.\nIn December, it wasreportedthat over 100 spinning mills and over 400 ginning factories had become non-operational, triggered by unprecedented taxes, high power tariffs, and a surge in under-invoiced cotton yarn and fabric imports from China and other countries.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Islamabad, President FPCCI Atif Ikram Sheikh said, \u201cCostly electricity has crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector.\u201d\n\u201cAround 150 large textile units had shut down over the past two years,\u201d he stated.\nSheikh urged the government to immediately abolish cross-subsidies imposed on the industrial sector and reduce the policy rate to single digits.\nHe proposed thatinterest ratesbe cut first to nine per cent and subsequently to seven per cent to revive industrial growth and investment.\nTrader and business leader SM Tanvir said that the situation had also been highlighted in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2026 report, which increased Pakistan\u2019s risk rating.\n\u201cAccording to the report,\u201d he said, \u201cThe business activity and employment opportunities in the country are declining, while the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector has been reduced to a junkyard.\u201d\nTanvir criticised tax policies, saying \u201cnon-filers face no scrutiny when depositing money in banks, but are heavily taxed\u201d. \u201cIt appears the Federal Board of Revenue is working to please banks,\u201d he alleged.\nFPCCI officials warned that if the government failed to urgently address the issue of expensive electricity, the industrial sector could come to a \u201cstandstill\u201d.\nThe officials criticised the government and the Power Division for not passing the relief of reduction in electricity tariff to the industrial consumers.\nRecently, after NEPRA determined areductionin the base tariff of electricity, the power division maintained that the number of domestic consumersavailingsubsidised rates was very high.\nThey emphasised that there was additional electricity available in the country, but the capacity charges for unused power units were paid by the citizens of the country.\nFurthermore, they highlighted that the industrial tariff was around 12.5 cents per unit in Pakistan, whereas it was around 7.5 cents in India.\nThey appealed to the prime minister to \u201cremove the industry from the ventilator\u201d and reduce taxes on the export sector to prevent further economic decline.\nAccording to ananalysis, Pakistan\u2019s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed.\nIt further said that high and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation.",

A search operation was underway amid fears of further casualties at the time of going to press.\nOfficials initially suspected an electrical short-circuit, but said the cause was yet to be confirmed.\nThe fire spread rapidly, fuelled by combustible mat\u00aderial stored in around 1,200 shops in the ground-plus-three-storey building, spr\u00adead over 8,000 square yards.\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people had gathered aro\u00adund the building, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.\nParts of the building collapsed during the firefighting operation. Tra\u00adders\u2019 bodies estimated financial losses of up to Rs25 billion and claiming that 5,000 people worked in the shops.\nSindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the fire and fix responsibility.\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that six men, aged in their 20s and 30s, were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. Post-mortem examinations were conducted and the cause of death was declared inhalation injuries and burns, she said.\nMoreover, 26 men, aged 18 to 45, were brought for treatment, with 11 suffering burn injuries, she said, adding that all were discharged after first aid as none of them had suffered critical injuries.\nShe said \u201cmass disaster protocols\u201d had been activated at hospitals after officials provided a list of missing persons, including women and children, and warned that the death toll could rise.\nRescue 1122 spokesperson Hass\u00ada\u00adanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that they received the initial call at around 1:38am on Sunday. He said rescuers were first told the fire started in a shop dealing in artificial flowers on the ground floor before spreading to the basement and upper levels.\nHe said the building housed shops containing clothing, plastic goods, suitcases and chemicals used for perfumes and cosmetics, while the top level had a roof and parking area.\nRescue teams, including those from Rescue 1122, the Karachi Met\u00adropolitan Corporation fire brigade, Pakistan Navy and the Karachi Port Trust, rescued around 50 people safely on Saturday-Sunday night, he said.\nAnother 20 people were rescued in injured condition, but three later died. Mr Khan said two bodies were recovered from debris late on Sunday night, while a 25-year-old firefighter, Furqan Ali, lost his life when part of the building collapsed and debris fell on him.\nHe said the intensity of the blaze had weakened the pillars, and the rear portion of the building had already collapsed, with the remaining half of the structure at risk.\nQuoting Sindh Building Control Authority officials, he said the building was constructed in the 1990s and an additional floor was added in 2003.\n59 missing; Rs25bn losses\nSouth DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police had a list of 59 missing persons. \u201cSo far, we have shortlisted seven of them based on their call details,\u201d he said, adding that their phones were last traced to the plaza before being switched off.\nSindh Chief Minister Shah, Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, IGP Javed Alam Odho and other senior officials visited the site and reviewed the rescue operation.\nMeanwhile, All City Tajir Ittehad, an alliance of traders\u2019 bodies, said in a statement that its representatives estimated losses of Rs20bn to Rs25bn, including the value of goods and reconstruction costs.\n\u201cThis is not only the destruction of a building but a source of livelihood for thousands,\u201d it said, insisting that over 5,000 people worked in more than 1,200 shops.\nPresident, PM grieve\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday expressed sorrow over the death of firefighter Furqan Ali, praising his bravery and offering condolences to the bereaved family, according to a statement from the President\u2019s Secretariat. He stressed that fire safety and emergency res\u00adp\u00adonse systems should be strengthened to prevent such tragedies in the future.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the loss of life and directed authorities to take all possible steps to protect lives and property. \u201cThe affected traders and other victims would be provided with every possible assistance,\u201d he said.\nPM Shehbaz also spoke to the Sindh chief minister by phone to express sorrow over the loss of lives and offered the Centre\u2019s full support to the provincial government.\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

Hydropower generation fell 51pc in the month compared to November. Hydropower contributed 18pc to the energy mix during the month, forcing reliance on more expensive thermal sources. These patterns are expected during the winter months.\nDecember\u2019s electricity generation mix was dominated by coal (24pc) and nuclear (25pc), followed by RLNG (17pc). Coal generation saw an increase of 125pc compared to the same month last year, while nuclear output posted modest growth of 3pc.\nThe data shows the government\u2019s shift away from furnace oil, traditionally the most expensive source of power generation. Furthermore, renewable sources, including wind, solar, and bagasse, accounted for 1.9pc, 0.9pc, and 1.1pc of the total mix, indicating limited penetration of clean energy in the national grid.",

It said the National Grid Company (NGC) faced critical overloading in several sections of its 500kV and 220kV network, particularly during summer peak demand.\n\u201cMany grid stations and power transformers are operating beyond 80 per cent of their rated capacity, risking equipment failure, voltage instability and outages,\u201d it said. In FY25, out of 192 transformers across 68 grid stations, 116 were overloaded beyond 80pc, it added.\nProviding a breakdown, Nepra said 30 of 47 transformers at the 500/220kV level were overloaded beyond 80pc. In addition, 86 of 145 transformers at the 220/132kV level were overloaded beyond the same threshold.\nRegions with notable overloading included Hyderabad, Islamabad, Lahore and Multan, with persistent constraints at key grids like Gatti, New Multan, Sarfaraz Nagar, Muzaffargarh and Sheikhupura.\n\u201cThese limitations have led to reliance on expensive generation in violation of economic merit order (EMO) and rising project costs due to delays,\u201d it said.\nIronically, most of these grid stations at Rawat, Sheikhupura, Gatti, Multan, Yousafwala, Jamshoro and Muzaffargarh have been in an overloaded condition since 2017-18 and onwards.\nAccording to the review, these constraints have limited full power evacuation from the 1,300MW Sahiwal coal-fired plant, overreliance on Attock, Halmore, Sapphire and Liberty, limited transformation capacity in the south-central corridor and aggravated bidirectional power flows in the network.\nThe regulator called for fast-tracking the completion of critical transmission projects, upgrading existing substations with higher-capacity transformers and reactive power support, and enhancing real-time grid monitoring to address persistent overloading in the transmission network.\nIt said the resulting financial burden could not be calculated under current conditions because assessing the severity and duration of overloading would require hourly digitised operational data to determine how long a transformer or circuit operated beyond its rated capacity.\nThe regulator warned that transmission system constraints significantly impact the overall efficiency, reliability and affordability of electricity supply. When the transmission network lacks adequate capacity or flexibility, it restricts the flow of power from generation sources to demand centres.\n\u201cThis leads to congestion, increased transmission losses and underutilisation of low-cost or renewable generation, ultimately raising the overall cost of electricity,\u201d Nepra said.\n\u201cTransmission constraints not only raise reliability concerns for consumers but also lead to higher electricity tariffs. This is primarily because, in the absence of adequate transmission capacity, the system must rely on more expensive and less efficient power generation sources, even when cheaper alternatives are available but inaccessible,\u201d it explained.\nIt said that one of the key challenges in the country\u2019s power sector was the persistent inadequacy of the transmission system, particularly in evacuating electricity from cost-effective and indigenous generation resources located in the southern part of the country.\nIt noted that the system was often forced to rely on more expensive power plants in the northern region, which significantly increased the overall cost of electricity supply.\nDespite the critical importance of resolving these issues, many transmission bottlenecks have remained unaddressed for years. The NGC has consistently failed to resolve them in a timely and efficient manner.\nObservations show that nearly every second project undertaken by the NGC suffers from time delays and cost overruns. These delays not only inflate capital costs but also result in operational inefficiencies, such as the forced dispatch of power plants in violation of the EMO, leading to substantial financial losses for the power system.\nThe south-to-north transmission corridor remains a major bottleneck in NGC\u2019s network, limiting the transfer of cost-effective electricity primarily from coal, nuclear and gas plants in the south to key demand centres in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nAs a result, the system continues to rely on more expensive residual fuel oil (RFO) and re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) generation in the north, pushing up generation costs and tariffs.\nThe regulator cited the example of the overloaded 500kV Jamshoro and Matiari grid stations and their associated lines, which it said restrict power flow to about 1,800MW against available system capacity of 4,500MW. This bottleneck causes frequent load curtailment of up to 1,750MW of cheaper power. Evacuation of more than 2,000MW from Karachi\u2019s two nuclear power plants was another example.\nAs a related event, the 4,000MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) Matiari-Lahoretransmission line, commissioned in September 2021 over 878km, still remains underutilised due to delays in completing the 500kV Lahore North substation and related transmission lines.\n\u201cThis inefficiency imposes a financial burden on end-users despite the line\u2019s full operational readiness,\u201d the regulator said, adding that average loading of the line in FY2024-25 was recorded as 1,401.40MW with utilisation factor at just 35.04pc. There are many other such examples of smaller scale, Nepra noted.\nThe regulator also highlighted weaknesses in grid monitoring infrastructure. It said the original Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, the telecom backbone operational since 1992, had become obsolete due to the lack of hardware and software upgrades, impairing functionality.\nPublished in Dawn, January 20th, 2026",

      "fullText": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) endured a highly volatile week but managed to close on a positive note, buoyed by a sharp rally in the final session as easing geopolitical tensions and robust large-scale manufacturing (LSM) data revived investor confidence.\nAfter remaining under pressure due to regional uncertainties and mixed macroeconomic signals, bulls returned with force on Friday. The benchmark KSE-100 index surged by more than 3,642 points in a single session, reclaiming the 185,000 level and snapping a two-session decline.\nDespite the dramatic finish, weekly gains remained modest. According to Topline Securities Ltd, the KSE-100 index posted a week-on-week increase of just 0.37 per cent, sharply lower than the 3pc gain recorded in the previous week. The brokerage attributed the slowdown in momentum to reduced inflows from local mutual funds amid heightened geopolitical tensions linked to the US-Iran situation.\nMarket activity also weakened. Average daily traded volume fell 24pc week-on-week to 982 million shares, while average daily value declined 26pc to Rs58.5 billion, reflecting cautious investor participation.\nFriday surge offset geopolitical jitters and subdued trading activity\nKey economic developments during the week provided some support. Data released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association showed car sales of 13,280 units in December 2025, marking a 35pc increase year-on-year, though down 14pc month-on-month. Meanwhile, the LSM index posted a strong 10.37pc year-on-year growth in November 2025 and a marginal 0.16pc month-on-month increase, reinforcing expectations of a gradual economic recovery.\nThe bond market also signalled optimism. In the latest Pakistan Investment Bonds auction, the government raised Rs488bn against a target of Rs450bn, with cut-off yields declining by 59 to 70 basis points across various tenors. The fall in yields reflected growing expectations of a policy rate cut at the upcoming monetary policy meeting on Jan 26.\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd (AHL), the KSE-100 index remained largely range-bound for most of the week before closing at 185,099 points, up 689 points or 0.4pc week-on-week. The brokerage noted that market sentiment stayed subdued amid escalating geopolitical uncertainty, but improved sharply on Friday due to fresh liquidity, easing tensions and strengthened expectations of monetary easing.\nOn the macro front, oil production rose 1.1pc week-on-week to 65,444 barrels per day, led by higher output from northern fields amid reduced curtailment. Gas production increased to 3,012 million cubic feet per day, the highest level since mid-March 2025, driven by increased supply to the fertiliser and power sectors. Prices of motor spirit and high-speed diesel remained unchanged at Rs253.17 and Rs257.08 per litre, respectively.\nForeign exchange indicators showed marginal improvement. State Bank of Pakistan-held reserves increased by $16.1 million to $16.1bn, while the rupee appreciated slightly by 0.03pc week-on-week to close at Rs279.95 against the US dollar.\nAHL expects the market to remain positive in the coming week, supported by the approaching monetary policy decision and anticipation of a rate cut. The brokerage added that the ongoing corporate result season could provide further upside, particularly in case of positive earnings surprises. The KSE-100 index is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.2 times, offering an attractive dividend yield of around 5.4pc.\nAKD Securities Ltd also highlighted sustained volatility during the week but noted that bullish momentum ultimately prevailed as geopolitical risks began to subside and positive macroeconomic developments emerged. The brokerage pointed to defence export discussions with regional partners and strong LSM growth as supportive factors.\nSector-wise, transport, paper and board, oil and gas exploration, property, and automobile parts were among the top performers, while textile-related sectors lagged. In terms of investor flows, individuals and mutual funds were net buyers, whereas banks and insurance companies remained net sellers.\nOverall, analysts believe that while near-term volatility may persist, improving macro indicators and expectations of monetary easing could keep the PSX on a constructive path in the weeks ahead.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

      "fullText": "RECENT chatter suggests there is significant pressure on the government to movebeyondmacroeconomic stabilisation. With economic activity languishing, rumours of ministerial changes have popped up as well, as if somehow specific personnel are the only thing standing in the way of six per cent growth. Despite IMF tutelage, these pressures will not be easy to stave off. Something will eventually give.\nWhat are the usual pathways to growth? In Pakistan\u2019s case, reducing interest rates and easing up of import restrictions coupled with some sort of a tax let-off usually generates economic momentum based on consumption. This has been the script for several decades. Beyond the brief rush that it provides, its other outcomes too are fairly straightforward.\nThere is increasedpressureon scant reserves, a widening fiscal deficit and downward pressure on the currency. In some sequence and combination, this usually leads to devaluation and inflation, followed by areturnto the IMF\u2019s doorstep in the face of looming default. Macroeconomic stabilisation ensues through a throttling of economic activity via increased interest rates, import restrictions, and higher taxes. In other words, a move back to square one.\nFor the generation gaining adulthood in the 2000s, this particular sequence has already played itself out four times, neatly coinciding with a transfer of power between different actors. The fundamentals are still the same suggesting that the planned pursuit of growth would be a fifth repetition of the boom-bust cycle in just under two decades.\nThere is no straightforward path to growth that doesn\u2019t see us back to square one in a year or so.\nWhat is this \u2018fundamental\u2019 that has stayed the same? If we reduce growth to a simple arithmetic problem of finding enough dollars to spend, then nothing has truly changed on that front. In fact, dollars are even harder to find today than they were a few years back. The standard source of foreign exchange, ie, exports, are stagnant. Domestic capitalists find it difficult to both make things that the rest of the world wants and getting the rest of the world to buy the thing they make.\nGlobal cheap credit liquidity has dried up, there are no substantial geostrategic rents to be obtained, no Sino or Saudi benevolent patrons who can shower billions, and no queue of dollar-armed investors waiting to set up shop in the country. The only saving grace here are the common people, who ship themselves abroad to labour in harsh conditions for the sake of their families. Their earned billions are ventilating an economy otherwise plagued by asphyxiation.\nThis cursory, yet fairly standard, picture of the economy shows that in the current scenario, with all things being the way they are, there is no straightforward path to growth that doesn\u2019t see us back to square one in a year or so.\nMainstream, technocratic answers to breaking this bind are both familiar and banal. \u2018Reform\u2019 is the word most frequently thrown around. The power sector needs to be reformed so that the cost of making stuff (to sell to the world) can go down. The economy needs better documentation so that the burden of taxation on the formal sector (that makes things and employs people) eases up. The size of the government in terms of personnel and their regulatory footprint needs to be reduced so that there is more money available to be spent on enhancing human capabilities (and productivity).\nMaybe some of these standard technocratic prescriptions will take place in my lifetime (I am approaching 40). They may even lead to some of the results they\u2019re supposedly meant to produce, but there\u2019s little guarantee either way. There are other prescriptions too, more radical ones that involve mass mobilisation and the redistribution of means and resources to people in order to boost domestic production and consumption. However, the likelihood of such a path being traversed is even lower.\nEither way, past experience suggests that implementing even the most benign reforms is costly: the intra-elite political conflicts they produce are untenable, and most Pakistani decision-makers, civilian and military, are reluctant to go through with it. Why? Because politicians, even those with dubious mandates, have constituencies and status quo beneficiaries as benefactors; and the establishment, apart from being a status quo beneficiary itself, wants a resuscitation of legitimacy in the shortest time possible, which can\u2019t be squared with the long gestation period of technocratic reform.\nSo, instead, we\u2019ll likely see some jugaar that opens up space for economic activity and staves off difficult questions in the short run, passing them on to the next set of faces in charge. Two such shortcuts come to mind.\nThe first was alluded to by Khurram Husain in hispiecelast week \u2014 an external liquidity injection of the geostrategic/ geopolitical variant. Whether that comes through defence pacts and a backdoor to a new normal in the Middle East (or in the immediate region) is moot. If it were to transpire, it might give the Pakistani government some breathing room without changing too much domestically.\nThere is a second shortcut too; a domestic variant, being eyed and talked about for some time now. This one involves forcibly changing the nature of fiscal relations between the centre and the provinces through an amended NFC. By starving the provinces and holding onto more resources, the centre will be able to reduce its uptake of more debt, bring down interest rates, increase development spending and maybe even offer tax rate reductions for a short period of time.\nThe boost in growth will be welcomed, even if its wholly temporary. But in the process, a long-standing \u2018irritant\u2019 \u2014 the devolution of significant resources away from the centre \u2014 will also be solved. And it doesn\u2019t take much to predict in whose pockets these freshly retrieved resources at the centre will end up.\nThe writer teaches politics and sociology at Lums.\nX:@umairjav\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",

The 12-month tenor cleared marginally higher at 10pc.\nThe returns on T-bills generally align closely with the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s policyrate.Several surveys and analysts suggest that the central bank could reduce the benchmark interest rate by 50 to 100 basis points in the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting.\nThe reductions in the T-bill rates were as follows: 31bps for the one-month paper, bringing the yield to 9.8pc; 26bps for the three-month tenor, down to 9.89pc; 22bps for the six-month bills, bringing them to 9.94pc; and 16bps for the 12-month papers at 10pc.\nHopes for further softening of monetary policy amplified\nIn the previous auction, held on Jan 7, the government had also reduced cut-off yields by 29bps for the one-month T-bills, 34bps for the three-month papers, 32bps for the six-month bills, and 33bps for the 12-month tenor.\nA report from Arif Habib Ltd noted that the return of single-digit cut-off yields marked the first such occurrence in four years, with the last instance being in November 2021.\nThe government raised a total of Rs725.7bn in Wednesday\u2019s auction, against a total of Rs1.85 trillion in bids. However, more funds were raised through non-competitive bids than through competitive bids. The government secured Rs293.2bn through competitive bids, with Rs432.5bn raised via non-competitive bids. Of the Rs293.2bn raised through competitive bids, Rs236bn was allocated to the 12-month T-bills.\nThe double reduction in T-bill yields, along with a 70bps cut in the return on Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), is seen as a clear signal in the financial sector that the central bank may soon cut interest rates.\nThe SBP will announce its monetary policy on Jan 26. Given the significant drop in inflation, the financial sector is anticipating a potential rate cut of up to 100bps.\n\u201cThe downward movement reflects cooling inflation expectations, improving macroeconomic stability, and a decidedly dovish monetary policy outlook amid expectations of continued easing by the State Bank,\u201d said the AHL report.\nIn the last auction, the government raised Rs979.3bn through T-bills and Rs108bn through PIBs, totalling Rs1.087tr.\nCompared to last year, government borrowing has accelerated despite a stronger growth in revenue collection during the first half of the current fiscal year. The revenue collected during this period was 10 per cent higher than in the same period of the previous fiscal year. However, the Federal Board of Revenue faced a Rs331bn shortfall against the projected target during July-December 2025-26.\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

      "fullText": "\nKARACHI: Having scaled a new peak above the 188,000-point barrier overnight, the bears snapped the record-setting spell at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as investors indulged in profit-taking, forcing the benchmark KSE-100 index to close in the red amid extreme volatility in the absence of any positive triggers.\nAccording to Topline Securities Ltd, the local bourse witnessed a bout of profit booking as investors sought to maximise recent gains, leading to a volatile trading session. The benchmark index swung sharply, posting an intraday high of 901 points, a low of 1,994 points, and eventually settling at 187,033.27, down 1,588.51 points or 0.84 per cent, as cautious sentiment dominated.\nHeavyweights such as Pakistan Petroleum, Sazgar Engineering Works, and National Bank of Pakistan provided some respite, collectively contributing 135 points to the index. However, selling pressure in Meezan Bank, Engro Holdings, MCB Bank, Habib Bank, and Systems Ltd outweighed these gains, cumulatively shaving 792 points off the benchmark.\nDespite a bearish trend, market participation remained robust, with total volume rising 8.14pc to 1.32 billion shares, and the traded value increasing 8.89pc to Rs69.5bn. K-Electric topped the volume chart with 263 million shares.\nArif Habib Ltd (AHL) noted that, despite opening on a strong footing, the PSX came under selling pressure, with profit-takers capitalising on elevated levels, dragging the index into negative territory by the close.\nOn the corporate side, Lotte Chemical Pakistan Ltd announced an interim cash dividend of Rs5 per share for the year ending Dec 31, 2025.\nOn the macro front, Fitch Ratings affirmed Pakistan\u2019s long-term sovereign rating at \u2018B-\u2019 and assigned a Recovery Rating of \u2018RR4\u2019, following the removal of the ratings from \u2018Under Criteria Observation\u2019.

      "fullText": "ISLAMABAD: As many as 40 environmental samples from all four provinces and the federal capital were found positive during the month of December.\nAccording to an official of the polio laboratory located at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, as many as 127 sewage samples from 87 districts were tested for the presence of poliovirus in December 2025. Of these, 87 samples tested negative, while 40 samples were found positive for poliovirus.\n\u201cAs many as 23 samples were collected from Balochistan, of which 21 were found negative and two were found positive. A total of 34 samples were collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, of which 26 were negative and eight were found positive. From Punjab, 31 samples were collected, of which 25 were negative and six were positive. In Sindh, six samples were found negative and 23 were positive. In Islamabad, one out of five samples was found positive. However, five samples collected from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan were found negative,\u201d the official said.\nReplying to a question, the official explained that if the virus causing the crippling disease was found in sewage, the sample was termed positive, while the paralysis of a child caused by the virus was recorded as a positive case. \u201cA sewage water sample from an area is a basic parameter used to determine whether polio vaccination campaigns are being carried out successfully. After detection of positive samples, polio campaigns are immediately launched to eradicate the virus from the area,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA polio case can be reported in any city due to the frequent movement of people from one city to another, but the presence of the virus in sewage water means that a vaccination campaign in the area did not meet its target. The presence of the virus in sewage water also indicates that the immunity level of local children has fallen and that they are at risk of the disease,\u201d the official explained.\nAccording to a statement, in 2025 the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, led by the government of Pakistan, conducted six vaccination campaigns, including five nationwide and one subnational drive, reaching over 45 million children.\nAs part of this roadmap, the first nationwide polio campaign of 2026 will be conducted from February 2 to 8 in all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children under the age of five.\n\u201cTo further strengthen immunity, the government of Pakistan continues to provide free routine immunisation services for all children up to two years of age. Together, routine immunisation and repeated polio vaccination provide the strongest and most reliable protection against polio and other preventable diseases.\nParents and caregivers are strongly urged to en\u00ad\u00adsure that children under five re\u00ad\u00adceive polio drops during every vaccination campaign to protect them from lifelong disability,\u201d it stated.\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2026",

For Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus, the assessed rates have largely been left unchanged or fixed for the first time.\nThe revised rates were notified through Valuation Ruling No. 2035 of 2026, which will come into effect from Jan 16, 2026.\nCustoms officials said the revision reflects a decline in international prices of older smartphones, particularly iPhones, as these devices approach the end of their commercial life cycle.\nThe downward adjustment, they added, is intended to align valuations with market rates and ensure the benefit is passed on to end consumers through lower duties and, potentially, lower retail prices.\nOfficials said the new ruling covers 62 mobile phone models across four leading brands, either through revised values or first-time valuation. They said the methodology relied on market inquiries, benchmarked against trade-in prices published on the official websites of manufacturers, including Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nThe government levies multiple charges on mobile phones, including a flat Rs250 per set, 18 per cent sales tax, withholding tax, a handset levy and regulatory duties. These are calculated on the notified assessed value of each handset.\nA comparison of values notified for 2026 with those issued in 2024 shows a sharp reduction in assessed values for used phones. Used iPhones recorded the steepest cuts, with declines ranging from 32pc to 81pc.\nAmong the biggest revisions, the assessed value of the iPhone 12 Pro fell to $155 from $280, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max was reduced to $215 from $340.\nThe iPhone 13 was cut to $170 from $280, the iPhone 11 Pro Max to $145 from $245, and the iPhone XS Max to $95 from $150. The iPhone X was lowered to $57 from $75.\nEven newer flagship models were revised downwards, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max reduced to $295 from $430, and the iPhone 13 Pro to $225 from $360.\nThe department also fixed assessment values for seven newer used iPhone models. Under the new rates, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been valued at $460, the iPhone 15 Pro at $390, the iPhone 15 Plus at $320, and the iPhone 15 at $310.\nFor the iPhone 14 lineup, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has been assessed at $360, the iPhone 14 Pro at $290, and the iPhone 14 at $210.\nSamsung, Google, OnePlus\nBy contrast, valuations for other major brands were largely unchanged. Only a marginal adjustment was recorded for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which was assessed at $255, reflecting a modest decline.\nOther Samsung models were valued at lower but steady levels, with the Galaxy S23 Plus assessed at $160, the Galaxy S23 at $140, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G at $160. Older models included the Galaxy S21 Plus 5G at $69, the Galaxy S21 5G at $50, the Galaxy S20 Plus at $46, and the Galaxy S20 at $41.\nFor Google Pixel devices, the ruling fixed values across newer and older models, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL at $260, the Pixel 9 Pro at $195, and the Pixel 9 at $150. The Pixel 8 Pro was valued at $188 and the Pixel 8 at $98.\nA similar pattern was reported for OnePlus phones, with the OnePlus 12 assessed at $184 and the OnePlus 12R at $105, while older models were valued at $92 for the OnePlus 11, $65 for the OnePlus 10 Pro, and $60 for the OnePlus 10T.\nAccording to the ruling, the notified values will apply to used mobile phones imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, and will form the basis for the assessment of duties and taxes at the time of import. The values will apply regardless of the specific grade or condition of the phones.\nIt further stipulates that devices must have been activated at least six months prior to export to Pakistan. Importers will be required to declare the activation period, which will be verified by assessing officers during clearance.\nCustoms officials said the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held consultations with stakeholders on Aug 12, Sept 26 and Dec 15 last year. Import data covering a 90-day period was collected and analysed, while market inquiries were carried out to determine revised values.\nFor brands and models imported commercially but not listed in the ruling, importers have been advised to determine assessable values under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "fullText": "A CONTROVERSY is raging on both mainstream and social media over PIA\u2019s recentprivatisation. Unless this debate is addressed rationally, future privatisation transactions may also be at risk. Past experience offers a cautionary lesson: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to annul the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills did not revive the enterprise; instead, it led to itsclosurein 2015 and significantly slowed the overall privatisation process.\nThe popular binary often advanced \u2014 either retain enterprises under government ownership or privatise them \u2014 is flawed. Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations rather than ideological preferences. Pakistan has 85 commercial SOEs for diverse purposes across power, oil and gas; transport and communications; manufacturing, mining and engineering; finance; industrial estate development and management; and wholesale and retail trade. Of these, 51 are currently profitable. The argument that profitable SOEs should never be divested is as untenable as the view that all 34 lossmaking entities must be privatised. Neither ownership per se nor current financial performance should solely determine policy.\nThe basic principle for deciding whether an economic activity should be undertaken by the government \u2014 through its departments or through an SOE \u2014 rests on two questions: a) does the activity fall within the government\u2019s public policy framework? b) Can it be adequately performed by the private sector?\nRelevance to public policy framework:The PPF reflects the government\u2019s development priorities, as articulated in documents such as the Principles of Policy (Article 3 of the Constitution) and sectoral policies relating to agriculture, industry, trade, etc. In assessing alignment with the PPF, it is necessary to consider whether an SOE is connected to one or more core state functions \u2014 i) ensuring national food security; ii) developing and managing large-scale infrastructure; iii) national defence and security-related activities; iv) entities established through government-to-government or intergovernmental arrangements; and v) provision of goods and services of critical national economic interest. If an SOE falls into any of these categories, there is a prima facie case for retaining it under government control. The decision then is whether it should be retained in its existing form or restructured to improve performance.\nDecisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations.\nMarket failure considerations:The second question concerns market failure: can the private sector adequately deliver the relevant activity? Each SOE must be evaluated in terms of its operations, functions and market structure, with attention to the following: a) is the SOE a natural monopoly; if so, does an effective regulatory framework exist to ensure socially optimal and cost-effective service delivery under private ownership? b) Does the SOE perform a function that generates significant positive externalities and is, therefore, insufficiently profitable for the private sector to undertake? c) Are there alternative delivery mechanisms to achieve the same objectives?\nWhere market failure prevents the private sector from maximising social welfare, the government has a strong case for retaining control. Even then, competition can be introduced by dismantling monopolies where feasible and establishing strong, independent regulatory agencies.\nFinancial viability:While several SOEs report accounting profits, financial viability requires more rigorous assessment. The key question is whether the organisation can generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, meet debt obligations, and, where relevant, finance investment for growth while maintaining acceptable service standards. The financial viability test should be based on the following: a) Negative shareholders\u2019 equity: Any entity with negative equity for the past three years is financially stressed, as its balance sheet is not bankable and it remains dependent on government guarantees or direct budgetary support. b) Continuous losses: Entities incurring losses over the last three years are similarly stressed, as losses either necessitate government support or gradually erode equity. c) Return on assets: While return on equity is a standard metric, ROA is more appropriate when equity is negative. ROA measures how effectively management uses assets to generate earnings. SOEs with an ROA below five per cent for three consecutive years should be considered financially stressed.\nIn such cases, financial restructuring is the first step. If restructuring fails under government ownership due to extraneous constraints, alternative options \u2014 such as outsourcing, leasing, concession agreements, or transfer of managerial control \u2014 should be considered. SOEs that don\u2019t meet public policy criteria, don\u2019t address market failure concerns, or cannot be made viable even after restructuring are prime candidates for privatisation, liquidation, or winding up.\nLessons from successful privatisation:Pakistan\u2019s main privatisation success stories are the banking and telecom sectors. In banking, the share of assets held by nationalised commercial banks declined from around 80pc to about 20pc following privatisation. Prior to 2003, the government injected Rs46 billion to recapitalise lossmaking banks; non-performing loans stood at 25pc, and financial soundness indicators were weak. Since privatisation, four major banks (HBL, UBL, MCB, and ABL) have contributed Rs245bn in corporate taxes in 2024 with cumulative contributions exceeding Rs1.6 trillion since 2004. NPLs have fallen below 7pc, provisioning exceeds 100pc, and overall financial soundness has improved.\nThe main weakness in recent years is the growing role of banks as public sector financiers, reflected in a declining advance-to-deposit ratio. Importantly, public sector banks such as the NBP and the Bank of Punjab have also improved under a competitive market structure and rank among the top 15 Asia-Pacific banks. The ideological argument that these institutions must also be privatised ignores the empirical evidence that ownership itself is not the decisive factor.\nPIA\u2019s case:Applying this framework (spelt out in the SOE Triage Report 2021) to PIA leads to a clear conclusion: there were no compelling public policy or market failure reasons for retaining it under government control. The aviation industry is competitive, and private operators have proved their capacity to perform effectively. Despite repeated restructuring efforts, PIA accumulated losses of Rs850bn. The privatisation objective was not short-term maximisation of sale proceeds but elimination of recurring losses and revival of the airline as an efficient enterprise. Over the longer term, improved performance under private management is expected to generate a steady stream of tax revenues rather than drain the exchequer. In sum, Pakistan needs an eclectic, evidence-based approach to SOEs, which transcends ideological divides and focuses squarely on public policy relevance, market structure, and financial viability.\nThe writer is a former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan.\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

      "fullText": "Iran\u2019s economy is going through one of its most difficult periods in years, fueled by sanctions, high inflation, and a significant drop in the value of the national currency, the rial.\nThese pressures have had a direct impact on living standards and have also fueled recent protests.\nThe protests began on Dec. 28 in commercial hubs in the capital Tehran, when shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners staged strikes and demonstrations to protest soaring inflation, the collapsing rial, and deteriorating economic conditions, and have since grown into nationwide anti-government expressions of discontent involving workers, students, and others across multiple cities.\nThe Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran\u2019s economic problems amid the protests. Masoud Pezeshkian said the government admits to \u201cshortcomings and problems\u201d and is working hard to alleviate the people\u2019s concerns, especially on the economy.\nThe Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. It started last year at around 817,000 rials per $1, then sank to 1.42-1.47 million rials on the parallel market by late 2025.\nDue to the rial\u2019s sharp decline, most Iranians have struggled to keep up with steadily rising prices.\nThe currency has been suffering for years in the face of sanctions and inflationary pressures, going from about 34,000 rials to the US dollar in 2016 to around 270,000 in 2021 and some 430,000 in 2022.\nBy 2023-2024, the rial had crossed the 750,000 mark on the open market, and its depreciation accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the rial has lost nearly 800 per cent of its value, and as of this week, it trades at around 1.5 million rials to the dollar, severely eroding household purchasing power.\nAs the rial weakened, import costs shot up, feeding inflation and forcing businesses to raise prices. For ordinary Iranians, the falling currency has wiped out savings, reduced purchasing power, and created fear that prices will continue rising.\nTraders and shopkeepers have been among the first to protest, as they struggle to afford goods amid daily currency swings.\nInflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Middle- and lower-income families are increasingly forced to cut back on basic goods.\nConsumer price inflation remains exceptionally high, with inflation estimated at 30.6pc in 2020 before rising sharply to 43.4pc in 2021 and staying elevated at around 44pc\u201346pc in both 2022 and 2023.\nAlthough inflation eased to about 32.5pc in 2024, it is projected to accelerate again, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting inflation of 42.4pc in 2025 and remaining above 40pc in 2026, underscoring the persistence of price pressures driven by currency weakness and structural constraints.\nFood costs and staples have grown much faster, with sectoral inflation (such as bread and fruit) substantially outpacing the national rate.\nThe Statistical Centre of Iran reported that food inflation last September reached 58pc, more than double the rate in the same month the previous year. According to the survey, fruit costs have soared 75pc while bread and grains, which are staples in Iranian households, have almost doubled in price.\nAlthough the government provides cash handouts and subsidies, including monthly payments, and food staple, electricity, and foreign exchange subsidies, these measures have not offset the impact of rising prices, especially as the value of payments declines alongside the rial.\nIran\u2019s economy is still severely hampered by international sanctions. US sanctions limit access to the international financial system, banking transactions, and oil exports. Even when Iran is successful in exporting oil, access to hard currency is often restricted, delayed, or held overseas.\nAccording to aReuterssurvey, Iran\u2019s oil output fell by 100,000 barrels per day in late 2025 due to the sanctions, which directly cut into government revenue.\nTotal exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, while imports are expected to fall by roughly 10pc to $98bn, according to the IMF, reflecting tighter foreign exchange and sanctions pressure.\nIn 2025, the IMF projected a 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) decline in both output and exports as of last May. A greater decline of up to half a million bpd has been projected by independent energy analytics companies, including Kpler, Vortexa, and TankerTrackers.\nAs a result, foreign exchange inflows have fallen, and the Central Bank\u2019s capacity to maintain currency stability has been eroded. Additionally, sanctions have hindered trade and discouraged foreign investment, pushing Iran to rely on unofficial routes that raise prices and decrease transparency.\nIran\u2019s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. In the fiscal year that ended last March, Iran\u2019s Central Bank estimated oil revenues of $67bn. The bank reported oil revenues of $56bn for fiscal 2024, $55bn for 2023, $38bn for 2022, and $23bn for 2021.\nHowever, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the export figures vary. In the calendar year 2018, when the first Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran, oil revenues reached $51bn, according to the EIA. In 2020, they sank to $5bn, before rebounding to $43bn in 2024.\nIran\u2019s fiscal position remains under strain, with the government running persistent budget deficits amid constrained revenues and rising spending pressures.\nAccording to IMF-based estimates, the budget deficit stood at around 4.1pc of GDP in 2024 and is expected to widen to about 6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, before remaining elevated at roughly 6.2pc of GDP in 2026. The deterioration reflects limited oil revenue recovery under sanctions, weak non-oil tax collection, and higher outlays on subsidies, wages, and social support, adding to inflationary and currency pressures.\nIn its most recent budget, the government estimated daily oil shipments of 1.85 million barrels per day at $67 per barrel. However, the IMF projected that actual exports would only average 1.1 million barrels per day, showing a significant deficit.\nOver the last five years, Iran\u2019s economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown.\nAfter a period of lost growth in the late 2010s, GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022, largely driven by a recovery in oil exports and domestic services following the pandemic. This momentum peaked in 2023 with a 5.3pc expansion, but the trajectory has since cooled considerably.\nBy 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 from the IMF and the World Bank suggest a near-stagnant rate of just 0.3pc to 0.6pc. This recent deceleration is attributed to intensified sanctions, chronic inflation (averaging near 40pc), and severe energy shortages that have hampered industrial productivity.\nWhile the oil sector remains a primary driver of the nominal economy \u2014 which fluctuated between $350bn and $475bn \u2014 non-oil sectors continue to struggle under structural constraints and a weakening currency.\nIn addition, the labour market over the last five years has been characterised by a jobless recovery followed by a tightening market amid recent economic stagnation. Official figures showed the total unemployment rate declining from 9.3pc in 2021 to a record low of approximately 7.2pc to 8.2pc by late 2024.\nYouth unemployment remains a critical challenge, consistently hovering between 20pc and 23pc, nearly triple the national average.\nHeader image: Photo showing protesters taking to the streets in Tehran as police personnel stand atop a vehicle. \u2014 Anadolu Agency",
